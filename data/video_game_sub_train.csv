0,0,0,Horizon is an excellent game. Its story and visuals are where it really shine. The combat and gameplay leaves a bit to be desired but I still really enjoyed it. It's similar to games like tomb raider and uncharted.,1503619200,4
1,1,1,You will not regret purchasing this item at all it is worth every penny,1503619200,5
2,2,2,Well probably the best Final Fantasy in a long long time if you like it join the team,1503619200,5
3,3,3,Been using it non stop since I made my pc. Love these products to death,1503619200,5
4,4,4,The hardware volume and mute switch are really convenient. The cord is long and durable. The sound quality is really good - clear with good bass. I haven't had any complaints about friends being unable to hear me. Overall awesome value.,1503619200,5
5,5,5,Fun game,1503619200,5
6,3,6,The scroll wheel broke but I fixed it on my own. Besides that it's a damn good mouse,1503619200,4
7,6,7,This was exactly what i needed! I was building a custom Handbrake for a PC racing simulator for drifting on assetto corsa and this helped me program the button exactly how i needed it and it works wonders!! was thinking of using this to re program all the steering wheel buttons to get a different rim on my Thrust master wheel.,1503619200,5
8,7,8,wow no charge at all coming from it!,1503619200,1
9,8,9,excelente,1503619200,5
10,1,10,You will not regret purchasing this item at all it is worth every penny,1503619200,5
11,9,11,One of the greatness 2d Platformers of our time. Super sad it didn't sell great but if you have a chance play this bad boy.,1503619200,5
12,6,12,this worked great on my old tv which had a glass like screen. i now have a TV with a matte screen and the dot doesn't stick. It is still a great product and works really well if you can get it to stick to your TV,1503619200,4

14,3,14,The scroll wheel broke but I fixed it on my own. Besides that it's a damn good mouse,1503619200,4
15,10,15,"I loved this game! It was a great follow-up to the first one, but also a very different game. The camera, the fighting, the environments...all were much better. The story was also much more involved. I got about 20+ hours out of the game, but you could easily do longer. All the boss fights were manageable, with the exception of the last two being a bit more difficult. If you've never played the first game, I'd suggest doing it first. This story starts off from a radically different place than where the first one ended, but they do explain as they go along, tying it together. Well worth the purchase.",1503619200,5
16,2,16,When only the best will do fun very well may very cinematic if you have a weekend to burn this is the one for you,1503619200,5
17,11,17,"I usually write long reviews, but for some games, I'm going to write more of a short and direct review

8/10

Since the last one I played was 2k8, there have been major changes to the game. 8/10

In-depth fighting input / graphics slightly upgraded / more characters / superstar storyline is better / submission is little biased to the person who started it

there are modes, but I just played the regular matches. Also, the created superstar has been a mixed feeling for me. On one hand, it has multiple move-set for your fighter. But I realized they took out the create the finisher. I really hope 2k17 has that.",1503619200,4
18,8,18,excelente,1503619200,5
19,9,19,Never got to play birth by sleep but it was ok just repetitive after the first character you play. KH2 still a great arpg with the extra content make it worth it,1503619200,4
20,3,20,Don't get it unless you want mario pokemon or zelda. Not enough games,1503619200,3
21,8,21,excelente,1503619200,5
22,2,22,Pretty nice game for that kind of game it follows the series hopefully they'll be another season with maybe a bear finale,1503619200,4
23,8,23,excelente,1503619200,5
24,3,24,The scroll wheel broke but I fixed it on my own. Besides that it's a damn good mouse,1503619200,4
25,12,25,Set up was a little more complicated than it should be but the product itself met all expectations.  This was a replacement for a previous console and appreciate that the Wi-Fi is built in now.,1503619200,5
26,4,26,"This game is so incredible. The adventure, new game mechanics, everything is spot on and leaves little to be desired. Thank God they did away with HMs - no more HM slaves wasting a spot in your party! With the new daycare not leveling up your pokemon, the new IV judging system, and SOS battles making it super easy to raise EVs, there has never been a better time to get into competitive breeding and playing. I highly recommend this game to any pokemon player, seasoned and new alike.",1503619200,5
27,2,27,Now this is a decent game a little bit hard to comprehend up the beginning but it does give you a lot of play time and after a while you really get to enjoy it,1503619200,5
28,2,28,Well it's bottle feel you either like it or you don't but if you like it it's worth your money,1503619200,5
29,2,29,One of the top 10 games of the year definitely worth your money and if you played any of the other games on the series I must have,1503619200,5
30,2,30,Very good game for an indie game if you like something different these might be the one,1503619200,5
31,1,31,You will not regret purchasing this item at all it is worth every penny,1503619200,5
32,2,32,Yes I'm nice entertaining game buy it before Christmas so you can play it on the 25th if you get it you understand,1503619200,5
33,10,33,Nope...way too old-school for me. Very glitchy and no variety in environments. Bad camera and bad combat.,1503619200,2
34,2,34,Well what can I say good fighting game fighting game but to be the definitive edition is not the best,1503619200,3
35,13,35,"If you want to live out the TREK space battles. Pick up this game, I did not know it existed until someone told me about it. Its very ARCADE action based but its very fun and you can control a small fleet. This game really needed more HYPE for it.",1503619200,5
36,9,36,Solid end to the future series for ratchet and clank,1503619200,3
37,2,37,The essential Bioshock Edition if you like BioShock you'll really enjoy these many many R Us of fun,1503619200,5

I highly recommend this game to any pokemon player, seasoned and new alike.",1503619200,5
39,2,39,Very decent take and an old franchise entertaining interview like these kind of game it's pretty appealing,1503619200,5
40,13,40,Only issue is you have to take the 3ds out to swap games. BUT THIS IS A MUST HAVE if you want a better non painful grip on your 3ds.,1503619200,5
41,14,41,"I ordered a xl system and it came with extras. I hadn't expected that.
After looking to see if there were any real differences, I came to the conclusion that I didn't need this set.
It's nice, but at $15, I couldn't find a reason to keep it.",1503619200,3
42,9,42,Fun with a lot of content but beware crap hit boxes with enemies and certain weapons,1503619200,5
43,2,43,More fun than the original though not very good music on it it's definitely a refry but if you enjoy their first these Persian it's well worth your money,1503619200,4
44,10,44,"I really enjoyed this game. The story was compelling and the graphics were pretty decent for PS3. I would have liked a bit more atmospheric rendering, but it is an older game. Overall, many of the missions were great, sometimes a little repetitive, but well worth playing.",1503619200,4
45,14,45,"Turned it on, set it up, works great so far. Came with extras so that's a plus.
My son decimated his 3DS, and I wasn't a fan of the 3D part to begin with.
Larger screen, nice shell, no obvious signs of wear and tear.
I'm a happy mom for now.",1503619200,4
46,2,46,Basically one day maybe two days with the game and 5 hours with the movie steel very epic game if you like these genre,1503619200,5
47,2,47,Not the best in the series but maybe a close second,1503619200,4
48,9,48,Loved it this classic in HD,1503619200,5
49,13,49,"This is a CLASSIC. Fantastic art and visuals and solid action gameplay. Must have for PS2, PS3, PS4.",1503619200,5
50,14,50,"Have yet to hook it up, but the color of the casing is nice and grey.  Bought it to setup an gaming area in our house with an old tv we have yet to dispose of.
Post back when I give it a test run.
It did come with all of the original components and cables.",1503619200,4
51,13,51,A fantastic horror game. Even better in VR.  Its a must have title for any system that can play it. You can get about 4 or 5 play throughs out of it.,1503619200,5
52,2,52,This one takes you full circle very nice game and I'll take you back to the beginning of the HALO Series,1503619200,5
53,9,53,Great start to an incredible series.,1503619200,4
54,14,54,Brings back childhood memories of when I kicked ass before I knew it could feel so good.,1503619200,5
55,8,55,excelente,1503619200,5
56,2,56,Very well mate is not original but then again these games are just for people who like these johndra so if you like fighting and having a little bit of fun why not the price is good,1503619200,4
57,10,57,"Fun game! This is one of those games that seems silly in the first mission or two, but opens up considerably with environments and story. Many of the boss fights are quite epic and amazing as you move along. There's a lot of game here to keep you busy. Make sure you buy the squeal once you've finished this one. Graphics are a little low-res at first, but you quickly forget. Some of the scenes are quite beautiful later in the game.",1503619200,5
58,2,58,Next nice next generation zombie killer zombie decent but definitely not the best,1503619200,4
59,9,59,"Love the shooting, the story and everything but man not being able to skip cut-scenes sucks when you want to replay level for fun.",1503619200,4
60,15,60,"I remember when this game came out and a lot of the fans of the first two in the series (which are also great, by the way) didn't like the fact this game was only on the PlayStaion 2 and didn't have online multiplayer. I found this sort of hypocritical because Tekken 5 (which is also a great game made by the same people) came out at the same time and was (and still is) praised by fans despite not having online multiplayer and only being on the PlayStation 2. Now, as a game itself, Soulcalibur 3 has pretty nice graphics (even by today's standards), controls that are easier than they seem (especially if you do the training levels), and some well-rendered, entertaining cutscenes. I will agree with the fans, however, that there are a few characters (I won't say who) that are a tad overpowered, and that can make certain battles rather stressful. Still, fun game all around and as far as sequels go, this could have been a whole lot worse.",1503619200,5
61,16,61,Thanks,1503705600,5
62,17,0,i have about 30 hours into the game and i completely love the game!  easy to progress and fun to play im about 55% through the game doing side missions and at level 44. story line is good too!,1503705600,5
63,18,62,"So far I like this one, I have both ps4 pro and xbox one s (x is preordered) and I like that both chargers go up.. Wish there was one that went up but was just a drop and charge but Ill get used to it. Thank you",1503705600,5

78,24,77,It didn't help. The Wii still can't read dual-layered discs.,1503705600,1
79,23,78,included everything that was in the description. very fun to play.,1503705600,5
80,26,79,Work like new even if its used,1503705600,5
81,20,80,Very responsive! Love the rgb lightings. Very true to the color and the razor program to control all of it is very easy to touch.,1503705600,5
82,24,81,"Concludes the trilogy, and it's very rare that novel adventure game series get finished (not that anybody remembers LOOM anymore, or is aware of how Monkey Island reportedly changed hands after 2, and let's not even get started on the meddling in Inherit the Earth). However, it feels like a real rush to the finish, and the branching paths feel more contrived this time around. Somehow it still feels linear. If you've been a far of the series this far, though, it'll be fun enough for you; just probably not the most memorable of the series.",1503705600,3
83,27,82,"This is a Glitch filled mess. The most common and annoying glitch by far is the one where you are out and about on the town having a spot of fun murdering your way to the top and the entire application crashes. Suddenly the PS4 is say the application crashed asking what you want to do.  This happens about once an hour. After the game glitches some parts become harder to play because the glitch affects how things happen. I think the button mapping is compromised. Anyways it is easy to see that absolutely no quality assurance checks were done in porting Saints Row 4 from PS3 to PS4 platform.

The game is just as much sick fun as I remember so that part is nice. This is not a remastered game but it still looks nice on PS4. The extra content is also nice. This is a fun and funny game kind of like GTA if it were made by 16 year old inner city thugs! At this price I'd buy  Saints Row IV: Re-Elected + Gat out of Hell ... Square Enix LLC  just be aware this is not this companies best work.  Saints Row IV: Re-Elected + Gat out of Hell ... Square Enix LLC is a rushed PS4 port sold only as a blatant money grab. Little to No effort was made to insure a quality PS4 experience and brother it shows like mad!",1503705600,3

87,20,86,"Great design and a good mouse. But if you want it to be as smooth as you like, you'll have to tweak it in the asus program. My own personal opinion. The mouse doesn't move nicely when it came in stock. Some tweaking with the program will definitely make it much better and smoother!",1503705600,4
88,24,87,"Grinding those last few collectibles is a thankless task. They should've let you buy them in the in-game store for play coins or smash coins.

93,22,92,"Works great with Xbox 360 rock band games,  note this  is a wired plug in device,  sounds echoey but I think that is how it is supposed to sound in the game.  Kids use it alot had it for 8mo still works great",1503705600,5

97,24,96,"It fixes what's broken about Mystery Dungeon gameplay. The story is saccharine drivel that has nothing to do with Pokemon. Then it tries to tack the last few bits on as pay DLC, as if DLC itself is a draw.",1503705600,3
98,22,97,"Works but arrived in very used,  beat up condition,  not happy for the price,  but the kids liked it, drum sticks not included.  Note,  This item is wired in case you are not aware,  and does  have a delay when using with certain TV models",1503705600,2

106,31,105,"Much of a review of these grips would come down to personal preference. For me personally, the caps were way too large and placed a large amount of leverage on the thumb sticks (causing them to feel really light and awkward), the bumps were uncomfortable, and I would rather use the bare thumb sticks with no pad at all. Objectively, however, it is worth a $6 price tag if you think you will be comfortable with the large caps or are just looking to customize your controller's thumb sticks.",1503792000,2

I always played with the little white oval- shaped one before this which was very uncomfortable to play with. This However is marvelous. There is plenty of room to rest each palm on the 'prongs' and every button is at a perfect distance to mash away. I also love the fact that the X, Y, A, and B are all different shapes and sizes which makes it easy to find without looking. There's also the added bonus that I can use this on my Wii U and not just the Wii.

151,44,83,"The original Doom was one of those types of games that pretty much created the 3D first person shooter.  Although it was far from perfect and has since been surpassed by the games that followed, it is still considered a PC classic.  Although I wouldnt consider the original Doom one of my favorites, it was still fun and intense to play, so I was intrigue enough with the new PS4 version to take a chance with it when it dropped to under 20 bucks.

This Doom does a nice job at creating the look and the feel of the original with modern graphics along with the intenseness and frenetic action that the original Doom was known for.

The one thing that I wasn't crazy about in the original was the lack of a story and although there is a story here, it is rather basic one.  The game pretty much drops you into the action with barely an explanation.

There are plenty of levels and creatures to fight, although I do think as others have said it gets a bit repetitive.  I am not particularly crazy about the lack of map detail as well as I didn't really find it beneficial for navigating through the levels.  I found it too easy to lose your way, while trying to figure out what the map is trying to tell you.  Like the original, there are only saves at checkpoints, so that can be a bit frustrating at times when you are stuck at certain levels.

Like the original, it isn't my favorite modern-day shooter but it does have some intense fun and the chance to reminisce with a modern version of a classic.

152,45,143,Just bad gameplay. There is nothing exceptional about this beat em up that should make you buy it over any other japanese arena beat em up games. All the characters are extremely uninspired and there are far too many of them for how little they stand out from each other. If you're playing this for the ecchi factor you'll be disappointed. Everything is heavily censored and almost all the girls have identical figures with oversized balloon breasts. Some of the characters handle really poorly making the story missions a chore to get through. This isn't a fun game.,1503878400,2

Without spoiling that much and looking at the ending from a logical and beneficial for all people perspective, Joel was on that BS times the people that died from the zombies.

186,44,175,"This is one of those games that I missed when it originally came out, but I decided to try this game after finding it for under 20 bucks.  It is hard not to compare this game to the GTA series as it seems to incorporate some of those game play elements with some additions that make it something different.

I will say that some of the GTA like gameplay, such as the cop chases, seems to be a bit more difficult or not executed as smoothly.  I really didn't like the cop chasing element in this game at all.  To be fair though, this game focuses more on the electronic hacking aspect of the game more than the GTA style of gameplay.

There are also some quirky elements such as the virtual video games on the street and the weird trips that you take to drive over some flaming people.  The perk and ability system is also a cool addition to the gameplay although I found the ability tree a bit cluttered and harder to figure out than it should be.

The hacking part is fun for a time but does get a bit repetitive over time.  The main storyline is decent with some fun missions.  I did find the main character a bit conflicted as he was supposed to be a vigilante against crime yet does several criminal things.

There are lots of side quests but I personally think they are pretty much the same things over and over and I got bored with them pretty quickly.  I did find doing some things pretty difficult to figure out as it isn't always clear on what you needed to do to complete a side quest.

Climbing up and over things feel a bit clumsy to me as compared to other games I have recently played.  Graphics are decent for a game that is over 3 years old, although the graphics do seem to be a bit inconsistent at times.

Overall, I found this to be a mixed bag with some elements being fun and some just downright boring or poorly executed.  This game was alright but not nearly as fun as the GTA series.

203,60,191,"2.5 stars

I bought this to see what benefits devices like this offer. Most important for me is to see if it brings about a more comfortable hand and wrist position.

The Good:
- Programmable keys
- Long braided USB cord
- Mechanical keys that don't click loudly
- Good sized keys, not too small, not too big
- Arced key placement

The Bad:
- User interface to Synapse is too small to read and navigate. Needs to be suitable for todays high resolution 4K monitors. The application window takes up no more than 25% of the screen making it difficult to configure the device because its too small at high resolutions. They should have used larger image assets.  (-0.5 stars).
- Poor ergonomic design. Someone at Razer needs to realize the natural arc in the normal hand position on a computer keyboard. This arc position should be the same as it sits on the Orbweaver. I am a fast typer from decades of computer usage. My hand position on the keyboard ""remembers"" where keys are. Having to adapt my fingers and arm, let alone wrist to this device takes getting used to. (-1 star)
- The base module, below the palm module, should be height adjustable. This is evident if I leave the palm rest all the way to the top setting. There is no support between my palm and the base, leaving a huge gap to not rest my wrist on.  (-0.5 stars)
- Button stick is not fluid, gets ""lost"" at times. Not good for FPS game play making it totally useless. I'd rather not have it at all and place the  the spacebar actuator there to promote a better natural thumb position. (-1 star)
- Thumb space bar is all wrong. It should be adjustable to get it to the right height so the thumb can get to it faster and lay more weight on it. The spacebar in most games are for jumping - a very important action. Tapping this key with the thumb is very awkward.
- Overpriced
- Left handed only. Really wish they would have a right handed model as well as I'm ambidextrous.
- Doesn't lay flat on the table and wobbles, not good construction.

Tips:
- If you are having problems getting the Orbweaver to work, you probably need to hook this up to your computer's USB front or back panel. Seems unstable if you attach to a USB hub, even powered one.
- When you set the lighting, you can do so for every key. But make sure you don't have the All Preset selected (its on by default). If the All Preset is selected and you start to configure the lighting, you will wipe out all existing settings for that profile and have to start all over again. Frankly, they should just leave Presets out as the categories rarely correlate with my the way I want to set my fingers to the keys and lighting.

Summary
Games use WASD, CTRL, SHIFT for movement and SPACE to jump. These are the most frequently used keys. By doing so, this forces you to shift your hand one key to the left on the keyboard to play games. If you note the hand, wrist, and finger position carefully over the keyboard and then maintain that same position as you hover it over the Orbweaver, you are going to notice differences that will force your hand to adapt to the device. The big question is, how does this really help you play games better? What is the benefit? Do you feel more comfortable using this device? For myself, the answer to all three is that its not that big of a deal. There is no benefit if all the module components don't let you create EXACTLY the same natural hand position you are accustomed to on a keyboard and make it more comfortable and quicker to perform.

You maybe better off just using a mechanical keyboard and turning it 20-30 degrees counter clockwise instead and saving  yourself $130 bucks.",1503964800,3

205,60,193,"Very good quality mechanical keyboard.

Typiing on it is not loud clickity clack like I've used on other mech keyboards. This is quite to the point where it makes just a little bit more noise than my other membrane keyboards. Its slightly louder than my Corsair K55 and Logitech G213 Prodigy. Even more quite than my Razer Chroma X.

RGB lighting is very good and you get lots of control over it. However, using CUE to do it is a bit of a pain and not intuitively straightforward. It can also do only up to 5 levels of static layering which I wish it could do more.

Has an additional USB port that you can put your mouse in. I use it to attach my Corsair Scimitar. The only problem though is that this really needs to use two USB ports on your computer so it doesn't offer much advantage.

Does not work well with two Corsair keyboards running. For example, if I disable the Windows key on my Strafe, my K55 that I use for non-game play shares that same action. Shouldn't work that way. Each keyboard should be a separate device.",1503964800,4

219,67,123,"I've been thoroughly impressed with my racing wheel. It's absolutely incredible the difference this peripheral makes. Trying to play any racing/driving games with a controller had been my primary way of gaming, but this racing wheel made steering so much better. When I first started looking at getting a racing wheel, I went for a $100 mid-range one that I felt fit my budget better. However, I quickly learned that all racing wheels are definitely NOT created equal. Although this racing wheel is very expensive, it's been worth it to me. I'm impressed with the build quality, and it was a surprise to see that the wheel is wrapped in real leather too.

I really like the pedals as well. The base is heavy enough that it doesn't move when I'm moving my feet frantically accelerating & braking. On that note too, I don't quite understand the fault with the brake pedal? Other reviews that I've read on here have faulted it, but it feels pretty nice to me, and I'm able to brake pretty well with the games I'm playing.

Overall the quality of the device is excellent, performance has been great, and setup was easy. This racing wheel has made the racing experience so much better; It's the difference between night and day. If you're looking for a racing wheel, I highly recommend the G29. I love it.",1503964800,5

281,85,264,"I'm reviewing the Sensei 310 and not the other mice on this Amazon page. This is a very good gaming mouse with a good sensor that is a big improvement over the last SteelSeries I tried. Being a lefty, I really like the amidextros design. The sensor is very smooth and the high definition optical sensor is better than the high definition laser sensor that the Sensei Raw had. I think the upgraded sensor is a big change and am sad that they put this on the same Amazon product page as the Raw since the reviews are mixed up!

The build quality is pretty good for a lighter mouse. All the buttons feel very nice and the rubberized sides feel good too. I prefer a smooth scroll wheel, but for a clicky wheel it's good.

I really like using this mouse. It reacts and moves very clean. I feel accurate both in quick movements and slow. And it just feels good in my hand.",1504137600,5

292,89,273,"These are a so so budget headset but there are some issues that prevent me from rating these higher.
First I do want to say the mic quality is pretty good but I did have to turn the level all the way up to 95% to be heard in Team Speak and recording in OBS was difficult because I always sounded too low for my liking.
The Ear cups do a good job blocking out noise however they don't breath well and it makes it uncomfortable after about 30 minutes or so.
The sound quality is generally ok but I did have times where I would get a strange static and popping noise when using these.  It would be at very random times and I could never pinpoint what caused it.
The reason I keep speaking in the past tense is because I have already replaced these.  Not by far the worst Headset I've used but not something i could recommend.  If you can put another $10 to $15 into a headset, I would look into one of the offerings from Kingston or Corsair.",1504137600,2
293,60,274,"Good:
- Lightweight
- Comes in different sizes to conform to palm, claw, finger users
- Tracks well

Bad:
- No RGB lighting. Does not light up on logo nor wheel.
- Only 4 DPI settings of 400/800/1600/3200
- No software to customize
- Cheap plastic feel
- Plastic, not braided cord. Too long, gets hung up on desktop edges.
- A bit overpriced for a basic gaming mouse. Should be more in the $40 range given the cheap plastic casing and zero software.

A simple, basic gaming mouse with a good optical sensor in it. If you are looking for a FPS type of mouse, this one will do. The advantage is, it tracks pretty good and is very lightweight so you can pick it up and not grow tired over long game play sessions. I wouldn't use it for general desktop use, especially on large 4K/1080p multi monitors due to the lack of DPI customization - just for single monitor PC game play.",1504137600,4
294,90,275,"For the price, this is a solid backbit keyboard. If you do a lot of typing though, I would recommend investing in a mechanical keyboard. The price is a lot higher, but it is well worth it. I would consonantly have spelling issues and space bar issues with this keyboard because it just couldn't keep up with my typing speed. Lost of 'ghosting' issues.

If you need a quick, basic, cheap keyboard with solid back lighting options, you can't go wrong. But if you are a fast typer or want a more quality build product, I would recommend putting some extra money towards a legit mechanical keyboard. Something like the Corsair K70 lux.",1504137600,3
295,84,276,Good sound quality and seal but adding a clip to keep the cord from interfering during game play would be greatly helpful.,1504137600,4
296,84,277,"Yes, it's a video game and it plays.",1504137600,3
297,85,278,"As a computer tech, I suggest Dell computers all the time to clients. Dell's customer service isn't the best, but their business class computers are usually very good. For clients who don't want to build their own, I also suggest Alienware. Sometimes I agree with those who say Alienware is over priced, but I have an Alienware Alpha in my living room and I like it a lot. I just want to make it clear that I'm not anti-alienware and I'm definitely pro Dell. Beyond that, I really try hard to be impartial in my reviews.

That being said, I don't like this mouse. This mouse compares to a budget gaming mouse with a mid-range gaming mouse price. It's features and feel are pretty good, but nowhere near it's price good. I don't hate it, but I wouldn't suggest it until the price was under $20.

The mouse movement sensor and how fast it reads movement is the key to a good gaming mouse. This Alienware mouse has a sensor with a maximum read spead of 5000 DPI. Some brands use the term DPI and some CPI, but they're both really the same numbers called by a different term. 5000 DPI isn't that amazing and there are gaming mice in the $20 range with these specs. I also got a SteelSeries Sensei 310 which is only $10 more and has 12,000 CPI. Switching back and forth between the two, you can tell that the SteelSeries 310 has a much better sensor--it's just a lot more smooth. This is my number one complaint. I don't get why a $50 mouse has a $20 mouse sensor. This year gaming mice are changing almost faster than I remember. At the beginning of the year a 3000-5000 DPI/CPI mouse was the norm. All of a sudden the 5000 DPI/CPI is a budget mouse.

The build quality of this Alienware is fine, but it's nothing special. One of the pictures on the Amazon site shows a customizable mouse but that's the more expensive elite version. You can't customize the side panels or add/remove weights to this mouse. It's not a light mouse, but it's not heavy. It weighs enough that it doesn't feel cheap. The buttons have a nice clickiness, but we'll see how it holds up. I don't like the wheel. It's a clicky scroll and I prefer smooth scroll. Even if you like notched scrolling, I think it scrolls clunky. The mouse cable is good quality and seems like it will last.

In the end, it's just an ok gaming mouse that would have been a decent gaming mouse at the end of 2016. Even if it was $30, I would be much nicer in my review. This mouse came out right at the perfect time for it to be obsolete at a price point that is out of touch with the current market.",1504137600,2

301,93,282,some of these games are not compatible with each others guitars and are sooo beyond belief making you delirious with confusion when trying to get the right guitar with the right game espec. if you randomly collected bunch of guitars from thrift places..and they don't say always which system goes with which games have to look it up online and  there are 20 games and 5 systems and good luck with that!! haha its crazy i may get it right..someday..then  i read online about manufacturing issues..so i wound up getting the right game for the wrong system and wrong guitar many a time so far..this one was one of them..hmm..so i keep trying to find out if another  of same game will work and if other was just a bad batch and etc issues..on plus side they will work if you get the extra microphone..so for karaoke they are usually only working for that if want that i like for that but wished guitar part was easier to get to work..none of my 6 guitars ever work on but one game that only lets do like three songs till you have to unlock super fast hard levels i can't beat..and don't get me started on playstation dongles ahah...they cost extra did you know!! some luckily are wired playstation they may be the best..since that was only one that worked for me and no wireless guitars ever work..maybe because i bought the ps4 one that looks just like the ps2 guitar..and who knows if why won't work or manufacturing problems? maybe is ps4 ever goes on sale so one can afford it i can buy it so to try the four games i like on the whole system??,1504137600,3

The RGB colors are brought and look great, and the button layout is awesome. Everything feels well made and the buttons feel nice and solid.

If there is any drawbacks with this mouse, it would be with the Corsair software itself. I sometimes loose synce with the software, which looses any lighting and macro commands I have set up for the mouse and the other Corsair units connected. I believe it is a bug in the software when using all the Corsair products together. I often have to flip the firmware switch on the Corsair keyboard back and forth to re-trigger/re-sync the software sometimes when coming out of lock mode on Windows 10 pro.",1504137600,5
306,89,286,I love this Keyboard.  This is my first Cherry MX mechanical keyboard and I'm glad I made the leap.  The tactile feel of this keyboard is amazing and the audible click you get on each press.  The look of the keyboard wouldn't be out of place in an office setting and the fact that the back lighting doesn't look like the rainbow fairy threw up on the keyboard is a plus in my book.  The Logitech software is easy to use and it was easily customized to work differently in each game I play.  Would recommend this keyboard 10/10,1504137600,5

I personally use the the mouse left handed when doing casual tasks (surfing web, watching videos, typing essays, etc) and right handed when gaming to put myself in a focused mindset when gaming competitively. Or via versa if you like, I already have a lot of years gaming right handed so it's hard to convert.

--Ergonomics.
- If you have large man-size palms it forces you to grip the mouse tightly (which may increase aiming precision). If you want a more loose, comfortable palm grip i'd get the

Note that this mouse is not ambidextrous, but has similar features minus 2 programmable buttons and has a pinky rest.

-This mouse is thin in terms of thickness so your hand is closer to the ground than most mouses, again, may help with precision and accuracy.

-There's textured rubber side grips which feels very comfortable to rest before having to press the side buttons. Great for fingertip or claw grip users

-Mouse feet glides well with no issues

-Lightweight.
Feels very natural in the hand. For those who like weighted mouses, unfortunately there's no added weight options

--Optical sensor.

Has an optical instead of a laser sensor

No jittering at high dpi or having to lift the mouse to reconfigure yourself.  No spin outs (character rotates 280 degrees + in FPS) when gliding the mouse forcefully.

Less time blaming the mouse than your game/skills

--Buttons
Left and right click feels a bit loose/floaty before you click them in compared to other mice. You are not using extra finger pressure, but an odd sensation if you're not used to it.

Scroll wheel is a bit stiff. Good for internet browsing, but also for those use use the scroll wheel for weapon change where you don't want to accidentally skip over a weapon select.

There are  two programmable button on each side, which you can configure to your liking. I personally use 3 of the 4 when gaming, but a housemate that tried it said he kept accidentally pressing the right side buttons (when using right handed) with his pinky and ring finger during tense situations. You can disable one side if you like via the downloaded software.

Side buttons has less travel for the default configuration (where your thumb is closest to). For the buttons on the opposite end, some muscle memory is required if you plan to use those buttons, and have this mouse be your main gaming mouse

DPI button is out of the way in the center. Most likely you're not going to press the button accidentally

--Software
With downloaded software you can:
Pre-select macro and keyboard buttons to mouse
Change LED color and frequency change
Change Sensitivity

If you own a steelseries mouse previously, you may have to uninstall/re-install program if the program does not recognize the mouse. If so, make sure you screen shot your configuration before uninstalling, unless you have a good memory of your setup.

Overall, very good gaming mouse that has great precision and accuracy. Prefect fit for left handers.

--Extras: Other options (?)
My current gaming setup/daily driver when it comes to mouse include

Due the use of a lot of macros and programmable buttons on both, as it's more comfortable/reliable using these than a flat keyboard (having only use keyboard for chat functionality), especially with the flick down switch on the rival 500 for space bar button/jumps

This is personal preference though as each setup is different for everybody. For any mouse, including this one, i recommend getting the Razor Tartarus especially when you are on a gaming binge and don't want your fingers getting fatigued or strained

Pro Gaming Tip:  As mentioned before, if you plan to get the most out of your gaming experience, best to use different mouse and/or hands for casual and gaming use as it keeps you from acting lazy, and helps you be more focused during game sessions. For casual use, I use the a vertical mouse from Anker.",1504310400,5

405,67,366,"I recently purchased this stand to compliment my Logitech G29 Racing Wheel. I'm very satisfied with the weight and sturdiness of the stand. Adjustment are easy, and installation of the pieces on to the stand was easy. I'm very impressed with the design, and I'm able to play my games with no issue, or interference from any part of the wheel stand. The pole doesn't get in my way, and I'm able to easily reach the peddles with no problems at all.

My only gripe is a slight one, and it's something I can certainly live with. I'm 6'2"", and I like to drive my own vehicle from an extended distance in my seat to be comfortable. I'm not able to do this with the stand, since I'm limited in how far I can extend the steering wheel pole/bar (for lack of a better word). Extending the pole/bar too far results in the steering wheel sliding left/right too much... so I have to sit closer than I would like, since I need to keep the steering wheel pole tightened securely in place.

I'm still rating this item 5-stars, as it's exactly what I wanted & needed in order to mount my wheel. I also like how easy it is to fold up, and stow away. A great design, and a well-built product.",1504396800,5

420,121,343,"Bought this with prime and received it within two days as expected. Previously bought a black one,  that I was mislead to believe was a US version, and it also didn't look like it was entirely new/open packaging.  Returned it, figuring if I'm going to buy the Japanese version, might as well get this blue one, for a slightly cheaper price too.

Received the pch-2006 za23 model: box intact, sealed with a sticker. Opened it and had the American style power cord.  Everything looked nice and new as to be expected. Color is beautiful, but I love blue. Turned it on and I think it was fully charged, whereas the other one I returned was only halfway charged. Set it up quickly and ready to go!  I'm very happy with this purchase. But the one gb internal storage will not let you save much more than one smaller downloadable game, so you will need to purchase a memory card.

One more note: the button swapping thing with the Japanese model is not a big issue. When you play a US game, you will use the buttons like usual. It's only in the main vita home screen that o and x are swapped in function. You can choose to swap the buttons in the settings, but that fixes type menus,  but will swap it for your American games. So just leave it be.

450,130,69,"10/1/17 Update:
I loved this game, I've played it for over 224 hours, the game suddenly began crashing every time I played, making the game unplayable.

I haven't even touched the expansions because I wanted to make sure I took my time, what a huge mistake that was.

Anyway, a month or two ago the game started crashing anytime I interacted with a merchant. Now the game crashes after playing for 15-20 minutes or anytime I interact with an NPC. Rendering the game unplayable.

 I've reported the 38+ crashes to PSN and have contacted CD Projekt Red and WB games. After looking online, I found multiple people posting back over a year who have the exact same issue.

CD Projekt Red suggested making sure I had the latest updates (I did), uninstalling and reinstalling (I did, on different HDs even), reverting back to my earliest save (no change). After explaining this, the person I was emailing with suggested deleting my saves and starting over, throwing away 224+ hours of my life because they could care less about fixing a game that everyone's already given them their money for. Complete garbage way of handling this, no understanding or sympathizing with my situation at all.

This is so disappointing for many reasons, the first being that this game is universally beloved by everyone, including me before it broke.

The second reason being I truely believed that CD Projekt Red was different from the other developers, even if WB was publishing it. Then I saw how poorly they were rated by current and past employees on GlassDoor, even worse than EA, shockingly.

If/when the game is fixed & had the customer/tech support had seemed to care or empathize at all, this would be a 5 star game. As of today (10/1/17) this game is zero stars, it did nothing but take up space on my hard drive since it became completely unplayable, so I've deleted it.

Hopefully enough people will speak up when/if this happens to them and CD Projekt Red will be forced to patch/fix their broken game. As of right now, I've never wished PSN gave refunds more..

Earlier Review was 5 Stars: ""I love this game. What more can I say that hasn't been said here in all the 5 star reviews. This game is the closest any game has ever come to a perfect RPG. I worry that it's going to take a long time for any other game, even one CD Projekt Red puts out, will be able to come close to this game. I can hope though. Anyway, play this game, you won't be disappointed.""",1504483200,1

455,130,402,"Every person I've ever seen, loves Skyrim. For the life of me, I can't figure out why. Sure the world is big and there are tons of ""quests"" but I just don't understand the idolizations of this game. As hard as I've tried, I can't seem to get  into this game. It feels like a poorly reskinned Fallout 4 minus everything that makes Fallout 4 awesome. I understand that it's actually the other way around (I.e; Fallout 4 came after Skyrim). I think the mistake I made was playing FO4 before I played Skyrim. I'll keep trying periodically to figure out why everyone rants and raves about this game, I'll edit my comment if that ever happens. Today, every time I play Skyrim I can't ignore how boring and lifeless all the NPCs are, how boring and repetitive the combat and quests are. Maybe when this game was brand new, this was a ""Revolutionary"" game. Trying to play it in 2017 for the first time, feels like going back and playing one of the old Tomb Raiders on PlayStation. They don't hold up and they aren't good anymore, even if I absolutely loved them when they were brand new.",1504483200,3

462,130,409,"Unfortunately this game missed the mark. We as gamers have come to expect repackaged, reskinned, COD games every couple of years. This game was pure mediocrity and I don't endorse the shady business practices of forcing people to buy this game in order to get Remastered Modern Warfare. I gave this game two stars because I like that it seems like they were attempting something different, I give them credit for that. I also applaud the attempt at putting more into the campaign then these guys have in the past. It seems like single player has been thrown to the cutting room floor in exchange for ""better"" multiplayer, DLC and micro transactions. So I commend them for that, hopefully WWII will be better without tossing single player campaign out. I really wish I could rate this game higher, because it looks like they were trying but it just didn't work.

To note I think chat sounds pretty bad with the USB setup so I bought a PS4 chat cable from Turtle Beach which plugs from the Mixamp into the dualshock4 and sounds much clearer. Granted it adds an additional wire but the chat improvement makes it worth it. The headset itself is not bad. Very light and comfortable for extended use. I also tried my Astro A10 headset with the Mixamp and that worked perfectly as well.

Story is the same, but graphics MUCH improved.

The game also auto saves when entering new areas, which is very welcome feature to the original version.

The biggest change other than graphics is the loot drops and locations.

660,188,560,"What a refreshing change of pace!  The original Assassin's Creed barely made it into the gamer canon simply due to its remarkable and rather new playing style.  AC set the ground work for many newer games and was revolutionary for its time.  ACII blew it out of the water.  However, ACII also never forgets its origins and tips the hat to Altair and his time in the Middle East.  Now, however, the setting switches to Renaissance Italy.

Ezio is our main character, a charismatic, funny, woman-loving young man who is the exact opposite of Altair.  Though, if you read all the materials of the Codex Pages scattered throughout the world, you can understand why Altair was so solemn.  Ezio is naive to the world of Assassins and is happily being a child of the Renaissance with his family.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, his life gets a bit more complex when his family is utterly destroyed by men in power.  Thus begins his journey into becoming an Assassin.

As with the first video game, this one has two story lines weaving through it.  The first is Ezio and his becoming an Assassin and taking revenge upon the people who murdered his family.  The second is Desmond and his compatriot Lucy.  After escaping Abstergo they are in hiding with two new friends and a shiny new Animus that looks more like a gaming chair instead of a plastic and glass table.  Though both stories are important, it's clear that the more modern story is the one that is truly being sought.  Much like Ezio's time, Lucy and Desmond struggle to figure out ""what it all means,"" the Pieces of Eden, plus the attempt at decrypting Subject 16's final messages to the world.  It is only through Desmond's genetic memory that these secrets will slowly be revealed.

The game itself is leagues beyond its predecessor.  Instead of ""flags"" there are feathers to collect, along with Codex Pages for Leonardo da Vinci to translate, treasure chests with money, and glyphs that eventually help to explain Subject 16's discovery of ""The Truth.""  The developers listened when the complaints came in about the first AC, and so ALL collectible items help in some way.  Either to discover something profound, help to buy supplies and build up the Villa hometown that Ezio relocates to at the beginning of the game, or give upgrades to armor and weaponry.  On top of this, there's SO much more to do and it's not so repetitive.  You get to try out Leonardo's creations, assassinate in different ways, and fight in style.  Missions are varied, different, and the assassinations are more seamless.  You can hide in crowds or cause distractions and the best blessing of all is the Metal Gear Solidesque meter bars above guard's heads.  You have TIME to get away and you know how much time you have before they notice you're an assassin or up to no good.  The game, simply, allows for more finesse as should be an Assassin's way.

The controls are easy if you've played the previous game, but even if you haven't it doesn't take long to master.  Trusting in Ezio is easier than trusting Altair to find his handholds and stick to it.  And ready for this AC fans?  You can swim.  That's right, no instant deaths in the canals of Venice, thank the gods.

As for the graphics, they're STILL up to par for the most part, despite being made almost 8 years ago!  The cut scenes are not exactly mind-blowing, but the grand portion of the game which is spent in the world are lovely.

All in all, the game knocks it out of the park.  The developers were definitely fooling around with a fantastic concept in the first game, but this one helps see it to what has become a time-honored and loved series.  It is intelligent in that it questions society, government, and power while also providing a game that will give a decent amount of time, challenge, and fun to your lives.",1504742400,5

676,110,371,"First some housekeeping: As of this review, there's a 24GB patch to play online: just enough time to finish 3/4 of the single player campaign (more on this later). In order to play online on PS4 and Xbox One, you need PS+ or Xbox Live subscription.

Let's start with single player. Depending on your skill level at first person shooters (FPS), the difficulty setting you play in, and how many game over screens you get; the main story can last you 3-8 hours. Yes, there's a huge gap, because the difficulty setting is not really balanced.

If you are a casual FPS gamer or just want the experience the story, then you probably have to retry a lot in the default normal mode. I guess they did this so they can artificially increase the length of a short campaign. Even decent FPS gamers may retry several times depending on the level. On hard mode, even if you are a veteran FPS player there are some cheap one shot deaths that makes you restart 2-5min back. Easy mode is pretty much a cake walk if you're used to FPS and the game will last no more than 3.5 hours. To change difficulty settings, simply press triangle. the navigation of this game is not really intuitive so might want to experiment a bit to get optimal results if you plan to tweak anything

Story: Short and diverse. You follow several soldiers in different factions/region, each with their own story lasting average i say 60-70mins long. Each story have different game mechanics, vehicles and classes as an introduction to the multiplayer. Wish the game was longer and had all 5 separate stories/characters interconnect with each other. Unfortunately this is not the case as the only connection you get from all the stories is an short epilogue video telling you how horrible and gruesome war is while also trying to romanticize it. Basically each of the 5 stories is just an anthology of WWI shorts instead of a cohesive story.

Graphics are amazing. Love how the environment is not static having destructible environments, debris flying everywhere, different weather conditions (sandstorms/fog) bringing you into the wartime atmosphere as if you're in a real battlefield  instead of being pitted against each other on two separate ends of the map.

Sound is equally great as everything from loading you gun to the slow moving tank rolling close to your proximity. Best to use a headset for optimal game play experience.

Gameplay. There are different classes each with their own advantages and disadvantages, no one class can take out everything as it depends on your load out choosing between standard grenades to pick off infantry or anti-tank grenades to take out heavy vehicles.

If you spawn in a vehicle, you are only equipped with a pistol, so there's a risk/reward on heavy damage vs your enemies having stockpiled with anti-tank grenades/ammunition. Being in a tank doesn't mean you can easily mow down your enemies as if your enemies are fast they can maneuver around you before you can take the shot

There are gas mask in the game, if someone throws a gas grenade around you, you have to put on a gas mask on which hinders you vision a bit.
Good strategy to chuck in a gas grenade if you know your enemies are shot and hope the get lucky most of the time

Melee kills are very dangerous on infantry as there's a bayonet charge mechanic that could be a one hit kill if you land it correctly

Even though set in WW1 you get access to automatic guns which is supposed to be a rarity in that time period. Guess they added it in for the fun factor...but there are some bolt action guns that do high damage, and cater to those who prefers accuracy over spraying and praying

Elite class kits can spawn randomly on the map. If you get one you are practically a walking tank with a machine gun, a solider with a flame thrower doing massive spread damage, or you pickup a heavy damage anti-tank rifle while keeping normal mobility.

There are loot boxes you can earn while playing the game or pay with real world money. Everyone in the game now uses one of 5 or 6 guns/loadouts, as they've figured out which load out works best. You basically have to try to earn the weapons and mimic them if you want to be competitive now

Multiplayer. Online can be pretty hectic with 64 players on the battlefield with different load outs and vehicle setup.

Conquest Mode. Basically capture/defend control points on the map

Team Deathmatch: Whoever team kills the most in a set time period or get  set number of kills

Operations. Cool game mode where you try to take control of the entire map one section at a time. Before playing this mode, be prepared to put in one hour plus each match as it can last long if both sides are evenly matched. Large warships or zeppelins comes in at the last checkpoint which may change the tide of battle

War Pigeon. Basically capture or hold onto the flag till the timer runs out

Overall very enjoyable experience if you want to a real arcade-like simulation of war. Only get this game if you plan to play multiplayer as the single player campaign is just a glorified tutorial",1504828800,4
677,67,571,"I love using these! I've been using the KontrolFreek brand for over a year now on both XB1 and PS4, and I've been happy with the design, use, and quality of them. With regards to the SpeedFreek, I was a little skeptical - but I'm a racing fan on the Xbox One. I enjoy playing Forza or Project Cars a lot, and the SpeedFreeks made playing easier using these. While a steering wheel peripheral would work best, it's just too expensive of an option for me. These SpeedFreeks really work, and I noticed the difference right away. The open & contoured thumb stick cover used for steering helped me, since I wasn't unintentionally jerking the Xbox One controller's own thumbstick - making constant erratic corrections. With these thumbstick covers it gave me better control, and I was able to steer my in-game vehicles more realistically.

I think these are worth the purchase, and something that should probably be considered if purchasing a steering wheel peripheral isn't really an option. These are affordable, they work, and improvements in playign with the SpeedFreek is very noticeable. Two thumbs up!",1504828800,5

689,199,583,"I was a big fan of Xcom: Enemy Unknown, and an even bigger fan of Xcom: Enemy Within (which fixed the horrible game-breaking bugs, and finally made the game balanced, while greatly increasing the fun factor with genetically-modified and big robot squad members to command). The games were endlessly playable, but also extremely hard even on the lower difficulties (famous for save scumming and only obsessive fans playing through without a manual save to fall back on in case of disaster). So how does the full sequel hold up?

I gave up

I bought this game right after release, but didn't have time to play it until winter time when I got a break from work. I thought the concept and story was fantastic, but I made a crucial mistake...I played it on normal. I read a review from a stupid review site that said it was a cakewalk on Easy or Normal if you had played Xcom before, and I tried Normal thinking I didn't want the game to be TOO easy. I also didn't want to save scum and wanted to actually experience the game as it was meant to be played. I knew I would lose, but thought I could get pretty far in the game before losing. In actuality, I never got to experience most of the good points of the game, because my entire squad got wiped out multiple times and I was hopelessly behind the aliens. I never got to see high level soldiers, good upgrades, or much of the story besides bad effects. I wouldn't call it a ""rage quit"", but I simply got to depressed to play the game anymore after getting the game over screen (and it is a slow, agonizing death to get to the game over screen).

Now

With the release of the newest expansion, I decided to try the game again, this time on Easy, knowing some of the things that made me lose so fast the first time around (you have to pick up money..er supplies periodically, they don't just drop into your bank as with the first game, don't trade away all of your intel, buy weapon and armor upgrades as soon as possible, ALWAYS put your whole squad on overwatch prior to scouting or you can get your whole squad wiped out in a single turn). The game is still HARD.

Like the first game, it gives the impression that it's just tactical skill and decision-making, but in reality base management and squad management in battle comes down to memorization, nothing more. You need to MEMORIZE the correct order of upgrades, the correct order of turn actions, the optimized soldier loadout and upgrade tree. If you die, and die often while others breeze their way through the game, it is likely because they simply have memorized the META (most effective tactics available).

Practice makes progress

This game may seem like a soul-crushing insult to your intelligence as a gamer, or perhaps a lesson in how life with crush you into the ground and them laugh over your dead corpse, but if you keep at it, you may discover quite a different lesson. Xcom 2 was made with the story and setup it has because the developer discovered that most players LOST playing Xcom, and that was largely their experience (it can be hard for developers  to gauge a user experience because every difficulty except max is laughably easy for them due to the extremely high amount of time they spend playing the game). So what is the game's difficulty curve?

You are SUPPOSED to star the game feeling out-numbered, out-powered, and out-maneuvered. You are SUPPOSED to feel like an underdog who doesn't have a prayer. But if you persevere, learn from your mistakes, and PUSH yourself to beat the enemy (letting each defeat make you strong and more determined) you may indeed discover the legendary end-game where you feel like an unstoppable force, your neigh-invincible super-soldier walking the map like gods and godesses of battle. THIS is what this game is about. It's about struggling forward, getting knocked down and getting back up again, preserving and not given up, so that you can embrace your destiny and save the world.

Awesome and Terrible

This game is HORRIBLY optimized. The load times take forever (bring a book), and they are EVERYWHERE. There's a load time on loading a save file, then a load time on loading a battle, then a load time on returning from battle. This is REALLY annoying. But I can put up with it because 1. I like reading books, and 2. there is so much to love in this game...if you can survive that long.

A lot of the most annoying limitations of the first Xcom game are gone. You can now launch grenades (like rockets) after moving. Snipers do far more damage with their pistols than previously (early in the game they used to be useless). Upgrading weapons now upgrades the ENTIRE squad so you no longer need to constantly remove weapons from soldiers and buy tons of weapons for when your base gets invaded. The cost of many items has been simplified so you're no longer constantly checking trying to figure out what you can and can't afford to sell on the black market (most items just cost supplies).  But beyond that..

When this game first came out people said what they usually do, that only ONE class of units was particularly useful, but this is SO wrong. Your specialists can use their Gremlins to heal or hack remotely, and have a low damage attack THAT CANNOT BE DODGED. Your rangers' sword attack also repositions them, and can be used to deal massive damage with extremely high hit percentage AND take cover AT THE SAME TIME. Gernadiers are more resilient than they used to be. And the snipers...well everyone loves snipers. The weapon upgrades start out lame and then get awesome. Having a sniper that auto-reloads the first time they run out of ammo or has extra shots makes the entire class feel less limited.

All in all, I wouldn't say that this game is BETTER than Xcom: Enemy Within, but it's definitely a worthy sequel. I just wish it had been better optimized. The graphics don't look any better than the first Xcom, but the performance is terrible. I also wish the PC version had controller support like the first game did, and the omission feels downright lazy. It FORCES you to buy the console version if you want to play with a controller that isn't the steam controller.

If you liked the first Xcom game this is a must-buy.",1504915200,4
690,200,584,"Hilariously Fun! This is a solid and fun game. I love it!

I bought mine elsewhere but did get Johnny Gat, whom I really like as an agent.

The open world is great. The driving is really tight - I can actually drive in this game. Most games I overturn. I still have not won a race but vehicle plans drop in other areas. There are many things to do in the game. Main missions or just run around the open world and cause trouble.

I am surprised at how fast I am flying through the game, however. Still, there are collectibles to be had all over the place.

You can mix and match your team from the list of agents as you want. I find Fortune to be one of my favorites, she has a nice grenade secondary attack I like using. There are 12 agents in the base game.

I hope this game gets some more mission DLC.

AoM is not for young players as there is foul language.

I didn't 100% this game, but i came pretty darn close, and it took me around 25 hours - so, obviously not as long as FC 3 & 4. I don't think it's better than 3 or 4, but still an interesting game mainly because of the setting. Primal is pretty easy too. You have an owl that you can scout areas with that can drop bombs and/or kill enemies. You also have animals that you can tame and use as ""pets"". These animals can be sent to attack enemies and take a couple out at a time. Then you can heal your pets and send them right back to attack more. So you literally could take outposts out with out ever even seeing an enemy. It was fun to use the owl and pets, but kind of took the fun out of it at the same time. I would take over a fort and think ""man, that was easy"". The leveling up system worked well with my play style, so that was cool. Overall, I would recommend the game, and I did have fun playing it.

758,224,622,"after playing it for over 10 hours overall i can finally write about it

i did play RE PsOne  - Remake GC+ wii + ps3 + ps4

with that said Deadly silence is one hell of of an extraordinary experience as a DS game and im playing it on the New N3Ds XL with ease

now the FM cutscenes are based from the director's cut  so its in BnW with most of the bloody gore removed , which its sad but hey better than taking the whole thing off in a nintendo system .

now in game cutscenes are blurry and doesn't show it well n clear .

gameplay wise this is the TANK controls that we classic RE Fans really love n never get tired of it in which as i play it in the NN3ds XL it feels really good and comfortable as the default layout of the buttons really good as RE1 handheld port ..... errr  ... Re Remake  .

now you play as JILL & CHRIS in classic mode ala PS1 single player  or the amazing kinda brutal at start REBIRTH Mode as it has quirks exclusive only to the DS game  like touch based puzzle solving and interactions ,  knife combat segments which good for extra ammo exploit if done perfect .

touching both characters on idle will trigger nifty animations reactions just for fun .

there is also  a coop and Vs multi card game but since im alone sadly i can't share my experience about it but looks to be fun nonetheless .

this is a solid game to have and play on the DS line to even the 3ds line of Nintendo handheld systems .

as a resident evil fan its totally worth it specially if you like classic RE games .",1505088000,5

The cable is coming out at the keyboard end now causing it to cut out mid-whatever im doing so I just purchased it again, mostly on the fact that after 8 years of gaming it's what i'm comfortable with, but even compared to modern gaming keyboards i think it's still a top contender if you don't want to spend upwards $200+ on a top of the line.  It's ideal for MMO gamers with essentially 16 programmable/macro buttons that stand alone on the side making them easy to distinguish and press.  The keys have individual lights on them that outlines the keys and the letters themselves light up, not just light coming up from around them which is really nice.  It's fairly big and more bulky than modern gaming keyboards but i really like that about it.

826,233,248,"Not only the best Resident Evil game but also one of the best videogames of all time.

My time with RE4 before this was with the PS2 version, the worst of all ports based on visuals.  On PS4 the game looks and plays great at a constant 60 fps.  Modern third person shooting games allow movement and shooting at the same time.  RE4 does not do that so it may take time to adjust.  The game is structured in such a way that it plays very well after getting used to this gameplay mechanic.

It is not as scary as other Resident Evil games but still has its scary moments from time to time.  Another positive aspect of RE4 is the wide variety of enemies and levels.  This keeps the game from getting repetitive.  And that is important because this game will easily last 20 hours for the main game alone.  That does not include the extras lake Ada's game.

Final question is which versions of RE4 are worth it?  All of them of course!  In more detail:
Best: PS4, Xbox One, recent PC release (2014).  The consoles have slightly better textures but no anti-aliasing.
2nd: PS3, Xbox 360 run at 720p and 30 fps, still excellent
3rd: Wii runs at 480p and 30 fps.  Some people actually think this is the best port due to the wiimote shooting controls
Last: Gamecube, PS2, 2005 PC release.  Gamecube still looks great but excludes extras.  PS2 has the worst graphics of all ports and some slowdown.  The first PC port was botched, poor controls, graphics (although the graphics could be fixed with mods).

872,110,584,"Like Saint's Row IV there's a lot of witty writing and banter between characters with a lot of references to pop and geek culture mixed with comic mischief

Instead of following one customized character. you can switch between dozens assembling a party of 3 to go on a mission at a time. I find this less personal as you're playing from a team perspective instead of a single character taking the lead. The narration, except for introduction of new character missions focus on the team instead of a single agent you are playing. The agent you select/switch off from the party of 3 gives off one liners at times given certain scenarios. There's barely any character development as you just get snippets of back story to go off of.

There's no open world to explore for the main story rather you go into a hub world to upgrade your stats/gear, and make purchases for your next mission. Each mission run from 5-15mins average depending on your skill level how much you upgrade your character. While playing through this game, I can't help but think this would go perfect on a handheld console like the Nintendo Switch due to its short mission structure.

There is an open world segment as you can explore the city of Seoul, but it's basically a territory gain mini-game where you have to take control legion bases scattered throughout the map. Unless you max out most of your characters it's almost impossible to take over all territories as once you take over a few, one that you captured already is regained by the enemy. Once you gain a territory, you can earn addition cash/exp through side quests within that territory

You unlock new characters through the main story or tackling side missions. Most new character you encounter have a better base stat and ability than your current party, so it encourages you to switch off, even though the newbie is of lower level.

All characters you encounter are unique in terms of personality (most be overly stereotypical), abilities, and play styles.
There's a lot of ways to upgrade your character stats though points from experience gained

There are 15 difficulty settings in the game each having different rewards upon completion. Depending on difficulty you set, you get different experience points and cash based on how fast you complete them. Thus you have to find a happy medium for advancement in this risk reward system

Graphics and style is very similar to Saints Row IV. Visuals are slightly better than SRIV, but not the best the PS4 can dish out. When there's a lot happening on screen, the frame rate may drop a bit (playing on the launch PS4). Menus have the iconic purple and white color scheme. Hand drawn cutscenes are a mixed bag and feels off at times due to the uneven lines in one scene and smooth line on the same character the next

Gameplay is your typical run-and-gun 3rd person shooter with a lot of random abilities mixed in like a special that makes a random AOE explosion around you, or one that de-buff enemy stats once they're in a certain range of you. Aiming is very generous in this game as you can land head shot fairly easily. You should be more focused on positioning than aiming due to it's fast paced nature. Most missions are basically the same and it get repetitive fast with the only motivation being to fully upgrade each character and listen in one their one liners

Story is your generic take over the world setup, but again the witty humor makes up for it.

Overall, if you want a variety of bit size missions instead of one epic tale in the tone of Saints Row IV, you should give this game a try",1505520000,3

The game play is almost too addicting. It is very hard but the difficulty makes every new discovery and victory feel immensely rewarding. This was back when gaming was actually challenging yet fair, unlike today's games where practically the only series we can turn to for the same feeling is Dark Souls.

Pokemon Y is a little bit of mixed bag for me, it's most noteworthy feature is that between it and Pokemon X they have nearly every Pokemon available without having to trade between games. However, to counter that its story is some of the worst writing I've seen in the franchise. There isn't a whole lot of post-game content with is usually what I spend the most time doing.
All of that being said this is an ok game to start on if you've never played the franchise and between this and the 3rd gen remakes you can easily catch them all if that is what you're interested in doing.",1505692800,4

930,262,370,"Good Lord this game is gorgeous.  Granted, every game on PS4 that is not a port job (e.g. Metro Redux) is very pretty, but this one is truly exceptional in its graphical appearance.  My eyes were popping constantly in my first play-through.
The gameplay is also exceptional with good tight controls, interesting environments, a variety of weapons, double-jumps and wall-run maneuvers in the environment, and lots of features and options.  Very well-done game overall.
Also it doesn't take very long to respawn at the last checkpoint after I die.  Many games will take a long time loading the entire level or section, before you can resume playing after you die.  Not this one.  It's fast.
I'm now playing through a 2nd time in an attempt to get all the Pilot Helmets (collectibles) and I'm having nearly as much fun as I did the first time.
The only downside is that the single-player campaign is quite short, in my opinion.
I rarely give 5-star reviews but this one is deserving.  If you like action, shooter, and/or adventure games, give this one a try.  Rated M for mature.",1505692800,5

The RPG elements are new but not obtuse. And the writing is just so good. love the final chapter especially, and the puzzle that they make out of it. That stuck with me for quite a while after I finished playing the game itself. If you have never played the original I highly recommend checking this out.
Now the collectibles that came with this are all pretty cool. The art of the game is beautiful and the artbook is the best think about the collector's edition. The steel cover is neat, but I wish they had gone for a full steel book. The shirt doesn't fit me and I really wish it did...",1505779200,5

I've since found out the SteelSerise site is still selling the new unit, it's just not easily found on their site.

989,233,791,"Pros: great graphics, variety of gameplay, voice acting, amount of content
Cons: hard to follow story, gameplay seriously flawed, controls

First off it is easy to see why RE fans would not like this game.  Much of it plays like Gears of War or Call of Duty.  Those are fine games but if that is not what you want you would be unsatisfied.

Graphics are really good and framerate is great.  The voice acting is above video game standards.  There are multiple characters to play the game with, resulting in many hours of play.  I did not play it on previous consoles but apparently they added the dlc in this version, nice.

However, the game has lots of serious, serious flaws.
*can't pause game unless playing offline, and game selects online by default
*game does not pause when mixing healing items or switching weapons
*game controls are difficult to use and poorly explained.  Examples: qte circling actions with analog sticks are meant to be done with both sticks, not just one.  Tip: change the aiming icon to laser sight like in RE4 to make aiming easier (they should have enabled this by default).
*because the game storyline is told from multiple characters, it is really confusing.  I ended up finding a faq online tellilng me which order to play the chapters in order to make sense of the story.

Another example of flawed gameplay: on one level you are running down a train track and a train comes suddenly.  You are supposed to hit a few buttons as a qte event to avoid the train.  Thing is that I was not on the track at the time so the train should not have hit me.  Obviously the developers were forcing the qte event even though it did not make any sense given what was happening onscreen.

Another problem: zombies are bullet sponges.  Which is fine except that sometimes I found them not taking damage when shooting again after stunning them.  Or perhaps the animations were not there for multiple gunshots.  Either way it detracts from the game.

In the end this is a controversial game that some will love and others will hate.  As of Sept 2017 you can get it for a cheap price.  At discount probably worth a buy as long as you are aware of its many flaws.",1505952000,3

1029,113,499,"two reasons why i choose two stars one is this isn't much of a celebration since this is a reboot and doesn't have any of original characters and gameplay formula also lara is too much of a cry baby it's what nintendo did to metroid when they changed and ruined samus my other reason is how over emotional they made lara compared to when core design originally made her to be as well as tomb raider games i grew up playing and for the fact that these reboots are having a higher rating than any of the originals is a insult and i forgot to mention  u cant explore the mansion/ croft minor  like  every other tr game b4 the reboot even tho they show lara in croft minor in the story mode
my thoughts ""Upon release, Rise of the Tomb Raider was critically acclaimed, with critics praising its graphics, gameplay, and characterization.'' not because of storytelling which is average. i ppl are just too focus on graphics and realism and not storytelling which all of the originals even that other reboot ""underworld"" when square enix took over from core design after their failures with angel of darkness and the creator of lara croft Toby Gard distances himself from tomb raider franchise once tr gain alot of popularity to the point that ppl wanted to change his creation without talking to him first but thats another story away

now as far as the story *SPOILERS
 ""it begins at full speed, with protagonist Lara Croft and Jonah, one of her companions from the last game, journeying into the frigid mountains of Siberia. Through some flashbacks  both in cutscene and playable form  we learn that Lara is on the trail of an artifact and a lost city, two myths that her father swore were real before a tragic death. As the adventure progresses, Lara finds herself up against Trinity, a shadowy organization looking for the same historical discoveries for more malevolent purposes. Lara ignores her and organises an expedition to Syria, hoping to uncover the tomb of the Prophet of Constantinople, a key figure in the legend of Kitezh. Although successful, the tomb is empty, and Lara is interrupted by Trinityan ancient order of knights that now exists as a paramilitary organization investigating the supernaturaland their leader Konstantin. As she flees, Lara discovers a symbol etched into the tomb that she links to a book on Russian religious history in her father's study. A Trinity assassin steals the book, prompting Lara and her friend Jonah to give chase in Siberia. When the two are separated after an avalanche, Lara is forced to go on alone.

Lara discovers that Trinity has taken over a Soviet-era mining installation as a base of operations in the search for Kitezh. She is caught attempting to retrieve the book and placed in a prison cell with Ana. Konstantin forces Lara to reveal what she knows by slowly strangling Ana in front of her, but Lara is unable to tell anything of use. Ana then reveals herself to be Konstantin's sister and Trinity's spy who has been manipulating her father. The two interrogate her as to the whereabouts of the ""Divine Source"", an artifact believed to grant immortality. Lara escapes, and in the process aids Jacob, a mysterious stranger who leads her through the mines into the valley beyond. Jacob is revealed to be the leader of the Remnant, the descendants of the followers of the Prophet of Constantinople. As Lara aids in their resistance against Trinity, she begins to learn more about the deathless Prophet and the lost city of Kitezh. After being branded a heretic and pursued by the Order of Trinity, the Prophet and his followers resettled in Russia, where they built Kitezh. However, spurred on by agents of Trinity, the Mongol Hordes led by Genghis Khan attacked the city, and the Prophet was forced to sacrifice it to protect the Divine Source. The Remnant escaped and settled in the area, vowing to defend the city's secret. Jacob warns her that although the Divine Source exists, it is not what she expects it to be. Konstantin's forces repeatedly attack the Remnant, believing them to be heretics and justifying the slaughter as God's will. However, Lara discovers that Ana is dying and has been manipulating her brother to find the Divine Source and save her.
Jacob and Lara decide that the only way to protect the Divine Source is to retrieve it before Trinity can. In order to do this, Lara recovers the Atlas, an artifact that serves as a map of Kitezh. She is reunited with Jonah, who has been spying on Trinity forces, and they locate the path into the city. However, Konstantin has been aware of Jonah's presence and let him go free in the hopes that he would lead them to Lara. Trinity then attacks and take Jonah and the Atlas. Lara goes after Trinity and tries to rescue Jonah, but before she can free him, Konstantin stabs him and escapes. Lara takes Jonah to Jacob, who miraculously heals Jonah. Jacob then admits that he is the deathless Prophet himself. With Trinity advancing on the glacier that rests over Kitezh, Lara is forced to enter the city through the Path of the Deathless where she encounters the Deathless Ones, the immortal guardians of the city. Following the journals of a Trinity agent embedded in the Mongolian forces, Lara realizes the truth of Jacob's warning: the Divine Source grants immortality to the person who beholds it at the cost of their sense of self, and the Deathless Ones are the hollow immortal inhabitants of Kitezh who no longer know anything else but defending the city. As Lara enters Kitezh, the Remnant rally to attack the Deathless Ones, giving her time to reach the heart of the city. She encounters Konstantin blocking the path and mortally wounds him; he dies in disbelief that he was not carrying out God's will, but Ana's. Before his death, he claims that Lara's father did not commit suicide, but was in fact murdered by Trinity. Lara is too late to stop Ana from retrieving the Divine Source, a large glowing crystal, but wrests it from her before Ana can use it. Lara then smashes the Divine Source, killing the Deathless Ones and taking away Jacob's immortality. However, he is happy that his death has finally come and thanks Lara for bringing his end as he peacefully disintegrates. In the aftermath, Jacob's daughter Sofia takes over the Remnant. Jonah recovers from his wounds and joins Lara in planning their next expedition, with Lara vowing to investigate more of the world's mysteries as well as thwart Trinity's plans. A post-credits scene shows Lara and Ana leaving Russia, two weeks before Lara returned to the manor. Lara confronts Ana about whether Ana killed her father. Ana denies it, despite admitting that Trinity gave her the order. Before she can reveal anything else, a sniper shot hits Ana, killing her instantly. The sniper asks his unseen superior about killing Lara, but is told to stand down for the time being.""

to me this doesn't feel like tomb raider anymore
with elements that make this game as a combined copy of uncharted with things such as crafting and upgrade system & Tedious resource gathering and over dramatic sequences  also online co-op/ mutiplayer is also average bcuz not only your character die way to fast and there's not health meter to me it lacks just like that 2013 reboot i really don't care for graphics as much as new gamers but i do look for advance gameplay and this game and that other reboot doesn't have that at all and all the reasons why i used to love lara and tom raider games in the first place The best parts of Rise of the Tomb Raider's optional content are the tombs themselves.  Some fans were bothered by how the 2013 reboot featured very few tombs, temples and other similar archaeological discoveries, and how it forced them into side areas. That latter issue hasn't changed, but there must be over a dozen of these optional tombs now., and the puzzles they task you with solving are wonderfully designed. with a lot of difficulty
 Rise of the Tomb Raider has also greatly expanded the crafting system from the previous game. Lara can now craft a number of different types of ammunition on the fly,(not unlimited like any of the originals) while choosing from bigger upgrades to her arsenal of weapons at base camps. The resource system feels a little loosely implemented
WRAP UP:
RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER EXECUTES THE FRANCHISE FORMULA WITH CONFIDENCE sort of but
In many ways, could be viewed as a fairly modest sequel. It successfully builds off Crystal Dynamics' unnecessary reboot, but it does introduce massive changes spitting distance of the previous games including lara main weapon that was substituted with a bow instead of two pistols",1506038400,2

That aside, it's a perfect port of the original game with a lot of improvements to the graphics. Some people disapprove of the new character model's faces, but it's not a big deal in the end. If you liked the PS2 version of either game you'll enjoy the HD remake.",1506124800,5

1049,290,832,"SMT IV: Apocalypse is fantastic. If you liked the earlier SMT games like Soul Hackers you'll feel right at home with this one. It fixes a lot of things about SMT IV that were turn-offs to long time fans of the series and is a sequel to the game, not a remix or re-imagining of SMT IV.

The music is top-notch, especially because Shoji Meguro isn't involved (finally!) and Persona veteran Kenichi Tsuchiya is amongst the composers. It's a different sound from the original Persona games, but it's still great and lacks all of the repetitive musical tropes and tired J-Pop appeal Meguro relies on too heavily in his later work. The voice acting is also superb, not a single character has a unexceptional delivery.

Battles are fast-paced which offsets the high encounter rate, though you can see enemies and outrun them when needed. The plot is interesting and has a lot of twists and turns, and the character development is pretty good. There's a lot of new faces in the game, but they are all unique and interesting. It's a moderately long game and you definitely will put some serious time into it.

The graphics are a mixed bag; the backgrounds and 3D chacter/demon models are very well made. The demon portraits were made by several different artists and one of them is absolutely terrible, so it's jarring to cycle through your demon roster and see very impressive illustrations and then some amateur ones. Some of the background objects like trees and bushes have a bizarrely low polygon count and look like something from an original Playstation game. On the whole it's all above average, however, just a few things stick out.

Like all modern Atlus games the translation is well done but rife with spelling and grammatical errors. For some reason both Atlus and Aksys Games steadfastly refuse to proof-read their work.

I'd highly recommend this game to any SMT fans, especially those of you enjoyed Strange Journey and Soul Hackers. It's fine return to form and shows that Atlus can still make good games for hardcore fans even if they also have to churn out garbage like Persona 3 and 4 for casual gamers to make money.",1506124800,5

1. No stereoscopic support. The game isn't in 3D.

2. The primary font used for the bulk of all text in the game is incredibly blurry. This was done by scaling down and anti-aliasing the original PS2 font and then resizing it to fit the 3DS screen. It's very hard to look at after a while.

I'd suggest trying the game before you buy it to see if you can stand to read the blurry font. It may be fine for some, for me it was a deal breaker.",1506124800,1

Storyline? I thought it's pretty engaging, especially with the adorable girlfriend (not trying to spoil anything), maybe still a little cliche (cuz it's always that revenge story), but that doesn't take away the fun. And let's face it, the graphics is just hands down amazing!! The amount of details, the scenery, the people and everything, is just amazing. Great job Ubisoft.

BUT of course it's not perfect. My problem with it, however, is the fact that LITERALLY EVERY MISSION IS THE SAME. Basically, every single mission is to ""infiltrate this place and kill that person."" It gets so boring after like 10 of those!!

1136,319,876,"Hands down one of the best RGB Keyboards ever.

My last true 16.8 Million color RGB keyboard was a Blackwidow Chroma 2014 with their clicky Kailh switches. They felt okay, but they were very loose and mushy. Not to mention the spacebar wire broke after 5 months of use. This Strafe has Cherry MX Brown switches and they feel and sound amazing. When it comes to switch quality, look no further than Corsair.

The design is slightly different than the Corsair K70. This keyboard is made of strong plastic, which does NOT pick up finger prints! (thank god.) The cable is not braided, the switches are not exposed like the K70. For example, the K70's design is more similar to the Blackwidow X While the Strafe has a similar design to the regular Blackwidow Chroma with a white back-plate. Oh, and there is no volume wheel, but you can change the volume using FN + F5, F6 Or F7, so you still have volume control. The overall design is very nice. You also have a USB Pass through as well, which is nice. The RGB Version comes with a wrist rest, which is nice considering how the original strafe does not include one. However, I don't find it as comfortable as the one that comes with the K70 Lux non-rgb. But I won't let a wrist rest affect my final verdict.

Finally, the lighting. The lighting on this keyboard is beautiful. This keyboard has a white back-plate which makes the colors look brighter and more vibrant. Each key is individually backlit so you can change the color each key without it affecting others. On the sides of the keyboard you have the light strips, but from as far as I know they only stay white, it would be nice if could change the color of them like on the K95 Platinum.

Finally, the software. CUE Has gotten easier to use over the years. It's pretty easy to use now if you don't have ""advanced mode"" turned on in the software. Once you know how to use the software is when you realize how powerful this keyboard can be.

So, would I recommend it? YES! If you don't mind not having a volume wheel, braided cable or metal build quality, then this is the keyboard for you!",1506470400,5

1140,321,880,"I love this game!! Of course, it is not like the old school games, Resident Evil 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 but I like the fact that Capcom makes different styles of Resident Evil games because I'm a big fan of the Franchise. Resident Evil 5 is more action packed than scary but I still get to shoot and kill zombies and mutated monsters. And I like having my partner with me too. She can hold stuff and we can swap and give things to one another. When I finish this one, I'm gonna get Resident Evil 6, because I didn't get a chance to play Resident Evil 5 or 6 on the consoles, (XBOX 360 and PlayStation 3) before the present consoles. So, it's new to me. And the graphics are really good but I find the tone of color odd.

To the movies. They never made a Resident Evil movie that's like the old school Resident Evil games 0-4, which would be pretty cool. But with Resident 5, they may have finally made a video game that's similar to the movies. RE 5's story may be different from the movies but it is action-packed just like the movies. I happen to like the movies too. So maybe... That is why I like RE5 and I can see why it is compared to ""Dead Rising 2."" With all said, I like that this game is kinda opposite from the ones before it. Just fun action!",1506470400,4

Again, having played all the previous Tales Of games before this I can say the combat system is literally just button rolls. Not sure what else to say. The environments are big but thats just it. Nothing to really do but fight the small amount of enemies you find roaming in huge fields. Honestly the combat in this is repetitive but I could care less about that, I came for the trophies.",1506470400,3

1151,325,888,"In many ways, this is like the ultimate One Piece game. It takes you through all of the major arcs up through Dressrosa (which has an improvised ending because the arc was not complete by the time this game was finished; for reference, there is no gear 4th in this game). You plow through the story putting down hundreds of enemies per stage with unique abilities and character strategies. When you finish story mode (which you will likely never tire of reliving), there is an exhaustive challenge mode where you take on dozens of various stages. The biggest drag of this game is that characters have to have ""level breaks"" to get past level 50. Definitely buy this game if you are a One Piece fan. It is English subbed with Japanese audio.",1506556800,5

1154,327,726,"Endless customization doesn't actually mean you'll find a sweet spot. This was an interesting experiment for sure, but after trying to use it for 2 weeks, i just could not put up with the learning curve VS benefits.

I've seen the numerous videos supporting the Steam Controller. How it can be more accurate than a traditional X Box pad. For me personally, the discomfort was just too great. The track pad was just never accurate for me, no matter how much i tweaked it, the fact that i have to center my thumbs constantly on a flat pad made it hell for FPS, and for the much advertised Point and Click games that it works with? It....does work. But i always found myself reaching for a mouse.

Other reviews have said this the best. The Steam controller is an enabler. It makes games like RTS's that are impossible on the gamepad possible. Whether or not you WANT that feature, at the cost of comfort, is up to you. I don't recommend this if you want to play on your PC where you already have a mouse and keyboard as a better alternative.",1506556800,3

1160,67,893,"This was a really fun game to play, and it was a pretty easy game to earn the Platinum trophy as well. The game looks are plays nicely on the PS Vita. The story is pretty short though, but it's fairly interesting. There are several difficulty levels to play this game on, so if it seems too easy--you can easily turn up the challenge. Enemy A.I. is pretty predictable, and you can deal with enemies fairly well when you have cover.

The online community for this game is absolutely positively DEAD. If you're expecting to play any online content whatsoever, forget about it. I've literally waited for hours in a lobby hoping players would join me, and it never happened. There's no interest in this game by players it seems, so be warned--especially if you're going for the online trophies; You'll need a friend to help boost you.

Overall this is a good game, and I'm glad that I played it. However, there's just no replayability in this title after you finish it. It took me about 6 hours to complete the single player campaign, and I spend about another 12 more hours on/off trying to find a person to play with online--which is futile at this point. I recommend getting this game used, or at a discount if you can find it. It's still fun to play, and if you're a trophy hunter it's worth doing.",1506556800,4

Not this one. After 6 months of stress testing it, through RTS and FPS games, along with usual daily usage and web browsing extensively with the scroll wheel, there hasn't once been an issue.

Its comfortable, very customization with the supplied mouse weights, and the software is easy to use. It fits my rather meaty hand well too, so if you have a fat palm, fret not. This will be comfortable. Probably. How should i know.

The best part of it is that you can get a permanent save every boss battle, and even a temporary save right in the middle of a level.

1304,67,95,"This game is fairly mediocre in my opinion. It feels like a watered-down ARPG. Most reviewers seem to compare this game to Blizzard's popular game of the genre: Diablo. However, this game is only similar to Diablo in the fact that it's an ARPG, and it's displayed at a 45-degree isometric view. While this game isn't bad by any means, it's still fun to play. Character creation is lackluster, and truth be told it really doesn't need one--but I guess this game sets itself apart from others because of it. This game is more fun played with other people, and while online play is a mixed bag of skilled/non-skilled players... the single player aspect of the title felt really dull to me. Online play is where the appeal for this title is with me, otherwise it doesn't have much replayability. If I had to recommend this game, I'd probably tell a friend to pass.",1506988800,3

The makeup that comes with this stuff pack is bold but I like it myself because who wants to be dull looking at a party?

1342,373,464,"To be honest I was a little underwhelmed with this game.  One main problem is that it is an ""open world"", but what I did in the open world seemed to have little consequence on my character's development.  It just seemed to me like a boring necessity to walk around to get to the next chapter/mission.  I like the overall game concept and the music is stellar.  I liked the soundtrack so much I bought it so much on Amazon.  But, as for the game, I got bored after a few hours and haven't played it since.  It was a unique story, but I just wasn't compelled to continue playing.  I intend to give it another go in the future, but its not high on my priority list.",1507161600,3

I love the super sharp controls, lots of stylish fighting moves, the amazing smooth graphics, Dante's broody & sassy character, the classic dark color palette and style... everything about this game is high quality.  I did experience a few stutters in the framerate but they were very small, nothing to complain about but thought I should include this in my brief review.  Overall an excellent game, and I haven't even started exploring all the extras.  I was expecting all the slashing, stabbing and shooting to become repetitive, but this common pitfall in action games is masterfully avoided with an assortment of enemies to fight, a variety of weapons and tons of different attacks options, and a changing environment.  I have played nearly all of the DMC games in the series and this is by far the best one yet.  Highly recommended for action game fans!",1507248000,5
1369,110,1025,"First i would like to say, if you're an audiophile and want high quality sound when listing to entertainment outside of gaming (movies, music, etc) then i recommend getting a separate headset for that. Not to say that the Astro A40TR is bad, it is above average (way better than stock headphones/ear buds you get with your smart phone for example), but it's not necessarily the best all around headset for entertainment even if you adjust the presets. But for gaming it's one of the best out there.

Mic Quality. Very clear sound. Communication is very good, you're able to hear individual words well. It's not going to make a natural sound like when you're talking face-to-face with someone. It's more like a crystal clear radio voice with no raspy interference or static, which you need if you're in a competitive team setting

Picking up footsteps (Mainly for first person shooter games). Works very well, the drivers in the headset is dedicated to it, seeing use in other forms of entertainment is okay. This is basically what you're getting the headset for in my opinion as it's the main focus as being a tournament ready device. In general, the headset picks exaggerated footsteps sounds very well, which is perfect for gameplay (which is more enhanced if you hook up an Amp)

For dynamic range of sound, from my experience it depends on the game, and sound team of devs that built the game. If you want to be competitive for any game while using any headset, i recommend going to the sound options of the game and turn off music volume completely and max out sound effects/in-game sound. This will improve your game sense and may rank you up in the game because of it.

Comfort. One of the best headsets for long term use. Best I've tried is the Honstek G6 Wired PC Gaming Headset; fit your head very well and super soft even after extended use, but the sound quality is not good on it. Back on topic, ear bud padding is excellent, does not clamp your head with excessive pressure. You are able to adjust the vertical length of both sides for a custom fit. Love how the cups rotate, and able to hang below your neck and lay on your chest. Most headphones I've tried have a tight clasp squeezing, if not trying to choke you making you take the headset off completely and put it off to the side when taking breaks. With these they can just hang on you without any discomfort.

Visual design. It's all black with hint of gold. Would love if the spiral wire on the sides were of different color to make the headset pop-out more like the Astro A50 I own. Looks very good for home/office use. For displaying in public, you may get some odd looks, especially with the mic attachment. With the A40TR you are able to switch face-plates if you want a more custom look

In-line controls. Very ergonomic, you are able to distinguish every button/slider without looking at it. Very natural, don't even have to build up a habit. You can also lift up the mic on the headset to mute yourself, which I tend to gravitate towards since I built a habit with the A50s.

Overall, very solid gaming headset. If you can afford it, I'd get another headset for other forms of entertainment as this headset does a decent job, but not the best out there. Having a variety of headsets also helps you get more focused in a competitive setting when your head feels the difference in pressure making you more in-tune with the game (maybe that's just me). If you have any questions, put in the the comments and i'll try my best to answer to best of my ability. Happy Gaming!",1507248000,4

I do not like camping in real life, so I hesitated to buy this game pack in the first place, but I saw that this comes with some nice looking clothes and hairstyles, so I decided to try it. This game pack also allows your Sims to learn the herbalism skill which is cool. I like getting new skills for my Sims to learn. It is overall a nice adventure but after 3 or 4 days your Sims get homesick and it gets to where you want your Sims to go home too. I gave this game pack a rating of 4 stars because it is a nice addition to the game, but I wish there were a few more secret locations and adventures in it.

1407,393,1049,"shadow of mordor is a great stand alone entry in the lord of the rings and hobbit universe (though it does take place after the hobbit 3 And before the fellowship of the ring) that is also a hardcore R Rated Entry purely for the graphic violence, bloody action, and brutal gore alone. and just to remind you, talion and celebrimbor are neither good nor evil, they're much more shady than all the other characters but they're still very likable anyway, I highly recommend this game to those who are fans of the universe",1507420800,5

It would be super nice if I could SEE THE KEYS when I restart my PC. This goes dark making it impossible to log in without using some external light source. That's not why I bought it and not what I was expecting from a backlit keyboard. It's a very good keyboard, with some questionable design choices and terrible software. It's some of the worst damage to the ability to use a product I've seen resulting from poor software. Also, the Scimitar PRO RGB mouse I bought to use with it fails on startup.

I must unplug the mouse and plug it back in every time I restart the machine, it also is unusable in the login screen. The CUE software sucks and is very difficult to use. If you close the CUE software it goes dark. I bought this to use with the Corsair STRAFE RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard and the combination is a nearly unmitigated disaster. The keyboard goes dark when restarting and doesn't light again until after you log into the computer making the keys impossible to see in my intentionally poorly lit environment. I have to use an external light source to see the keys well enough to log into the machine, not what I expected of a backlit keyboard. The mouse as previously stated refuses to work until it is unplugged and reconnected, furthermore it refuses to clear some type of profile conflict regardless of how many soft or hard rests I perform.

1466,412,1087,"Gamepad isn't too small, the BUTTONS are too small. They should take up the entire face of the device and not have all the dead space present. It is very difficult to have real precision gaming with the little, baby buttons and tiny d-pad provided. A fireball is extremely difficult to pull off in SF2, megaman x is very frustrating at times simply because the tiny diameter of each face button makes some maneuvers almost impossible. I would not pay more than $10. I have medium-ish to slightly largeish hands and do not experience cramping, but the buttons are just too small. Shutter mode doesnt seem to work with android, you simple use gamepad mode as normal, use dpad to navigate to the take picture button and then press a face button.",1507593600,3
1467,218,1088,"Better than I expected!! I think this game was more like Sleeping Dogs than GTA, mainly because GTA can be so over the top. But it's a big open world with lots of side quests. The story was good and kept me hooked. I was skeptical about the controls being difficult because of trying to hack everything, but it was just the opposite - pretty simple. It took me about 22-23 hours to complete with some side quests here and there. I thought the cars and driving was good. Nice assortment of weapons and explosives to use. Some missions I found my self playing very stealthy, and others I went guns blazing, so good game for any play style. The only negative I can say is that I found it very easy to make money. So, early on in the game, I was able to purchase the best weapon of each class, so that obviously worked to my advantage. Overall though, I'm very glad I played this because I really enjoy it. Now I'm looking forward to Watch Dogs 2!!",1507593600,5

Now I have Astro A50's and they work perfectly all the time but battery runs out during long gaming sessions (older set) so I decided to go with a standard hook up 3.5mm plug Game One and these sounded great!! not enough bass for me however, even tho I have a good motherboard (msi x170 gaming m7) with good sound chip.

1501,423,0,"This game was definitely hyped up and these reviews of perfect 10's are completely incorrect. The game itself, like most people have mentioned, plays out like far cry/tomb raider/ whatever else open world game. HZD does not really differentiate itself from others, instead using recycled open world gameplay formula.
  I honestly believe people are just saying it's perfect cause the graphics and the fact it looks like a how a game made in 2017 should be. The graphics are really great with HDR and 4k, assuming you have the ps4 pro and hdr tv. The lighting looks fantastic and the detail is quit amazing. I really don't see any flaws with the graphics at all to be honest.
  Just because the graphics are great doesn't make it the best however. The open world itself is big enough, however, it's just so empty. Besides the map pointing out where any ""hidden"" collectable may be, there is absolutely no reason to explore. It's too bad considering how good the environment looks. Many times you will want to wonder off thinking theres something there only to find nothing at all, maybe just some dino robots. There is no sense of reward for exploration, just nice looking scenery.
  The combat was decent; not terrible and not thrilling. You're given many options of combat, however, arrows are really the only thing you may need. Theres traps, tripwires, ropecaster (good for flying things) but arrows were the only thing i really even needed. Theres many differnt types of those too but I only needed the ""damage"" arrows"". Once i discovered that you can freeze them with ice arrows, the damage arrows make it much pretty easy to take down the most intimidating robots. So ice/damage was all i needed. Even the armor had 3 classes: common, rare, very rare. I only needed one type of armor to survive, that being the last of each tier. Stealth wasn't needed very often, maybe for sneak attack, but you could easily go up to humans or some robots and start slashing away with your spear.
  The story was also just decent i found. You really are left wondering until kind of towards the end. Until then, you're just assuming it's an apolyctic world in which it's back to the ""Stone Age/ Tribe"" setting but with robotic dinosaurs? theres a war going on the first half so i find it didn't catch my attention at all until you explore the ""metal world"" or the old labs of humanity. There you find out what really happens and the story begins to pull you in. However, at the end (no spoilers), it gets pretty confusing and unbelievable. There are some nice twists though (especially the ending) and it does pull you in for a little while.
  The missions are not very fun though. The main missions are typical go here, kill that, learn piece of story. Nothing great. The side missions are just plain terrible. There's no reason to even follow the story of them as it's not exciting. You usually use your sense thing to follow a trial and look for someone or kill something. That is it. No reason to care just go here and come back. I really can't think of a single mission that was cool or rememberable. That's about it for missions.
  Lastly are the characters. Aloy is a decent character and nicely voiced by whomever. The other tribes can have nice voice acting but you really have little to care for these characters. The main characters in the story itself are pretty bland and really have no reason to care for most of them. You will meet a few who tie in the story altogether but serve little purpose to really care for them. You see them for a little while on screen and get introduced to another and tie in at the end. Not too much back story to really care and could care who lives or die in these tribes. The side missions, again, are even worse. There is no reason to give a shit about them or whatever they want. Looking for someone, piece of equipment, no reason at all to care. In fact, the real shame is the lifeless towns and the people who inhabit it. Theres a merchant, maybe a boring side quest or two, and that's it. Nothing else. People walk around and there's no interaction so may as well all be ghost towns. That really pulls away from the immersion. The holograms you see of the human world in the past, however, is pretty interesting towards the ends.
  All in all, i would give the game a 7/10. It was entertaining, but once you're done, you're done. You are left with a feeling of ""OK, that was entertaining on to the next thing."" maybe 60 hours to get the platinum trophy, which would be 100% completion. It was mostly enjoyable while it lasted but was ready for it to end towards the end. In time, people will look back and not care too much i think. It will be remembered for a great looking PS exclusive title one day and that's about it. HZD is basically a knock off of Far Cry with robot dinosaurs so if you're looking for something different, this is not it. If you don't mind the same typical formula and nice graphics, you will probably be entertained.",1507680000,3

The level up system is different than the original where it is the weapons and certain abilities like magic, intelligence, strength, health...and so on increase. In the first time when you got a certain amount of experience points you leveled up, which increased your health, magic, and other states, but not the weapons. You would go to different shops to by new and better ones, which I preferred. The map is a bit confusing as I was always going too close to danger zones. I got killed quite a few times and I'm embarrassed. I love Final Fantasy, but this particular one just isn't for me. I know many others feel similarly, but there are those who enjoy it and I'm happy for them.

1536,428,1124,"This is definitely one of my favorite Final Fantasy games and to have an updated version excites me even more. The graphics have improved like the versions for FF1 and FF2, the music has been updated and sounds so amazing and beautiful! It really fits well where each track is placed and helps tell the story and bring out the characters and themes. The characters are far more fleshed out and interesting and have great and unique personalities. There are traditional arcs as well as new ones thought up by Square Enix. The gameplay is different than it's earlier games as it has an ATB gauge, which once filled gives each of the characters a turn. There isn't a pause or delay like in FF1-3, so it's important to know what you are doing or you can die or get badly damaged. It is also the first and only FF game to have as many as 5 characters at a time, but it isn't all throughout the game. At first it is 2, but the average is 3 as characters come in and out of your control due to the events of the story, which enriches and brings a challenge to the game. This is not an easy game, especially if you don't know what you are doing, but once you get the hang of it it's great fun as well as challenging. I'd highly recommend this game for any Final Fantasy fan or anyone interested in RPG's and adventure games.  I can't say enough about this game...it's that good :)",1507766400,5

I definitely wouldn't have paid for this game if I knew it was so visually unappealing and boring. 10 minutes of playing and I was done. I only bought this game because I trusted the reviews but it wasn't for me. In this game you're just flying around in a limited cityscape in some post human world of animals and that would've been fine except everything looks like 1st gen PlayStation graphics; very polygonal. I was quite disappointed. Add to that i had to steer with my head and the motion sickness wasn't worth it.

2.  It's too easy once you do get busted.  Seriously,  snake is one hell of a bullet sponge and I think the slomo deal when you get busted is unnecessary.
3.  I encountered a incredibly frustrating glitch during a mission that I spent a lot of time on only to have to start over from the beginning due to not being able to hear the instructions over the noise of a sandstorm.  Which brings me to my next point.
4.  Instructions and tutorials are VERY lacking.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to Google how to do something properly or what something in the mother base menu meant.  The game is terrible at explaining some things.

1587,27,1154,"far Cry is one of those franchises that you either love it or hate it. Now there is a lot about Far Cry that I hate but that was limited mostly to Far Cry 3 there your character was made to seem like a flaming dope addict using syringes of stuff to play the game. Syringes of crap to resist fire, dive deeper for longer periods, gain health and whatever else. I just felt the whole syringe system of health and wellness management in the game sends the wrong message. If any video game can ever be dinged for normalizing needle injecting drug abuse this Far Cry 3 is the best example.

The idea that you must ""shoot up"" before entering a battle I think sends the exact wrong message in a country where so many people are dying of injected opioid based addictions. Beyond the syringe based health management system the game is actually very good and fun to play. The fact that you can't liberate needed bases without ""shooting up"" using the fire resistance syringe to survive is a downer but the crafting system is fun and adds a nice sub plot to the game that did not overpower the main narrative. A case where weapons and item crafting became way to involved to the point where it killed the game was in the later Dead Space installments.

Far Cry 3 has a very good balance of crafting versus game play in ways that actually add to the fun of the game. The crafting actually adds to and flows with the intensity of the story instead of feeling like a distraction. The syringe system actually slows down and interrupts the game play in Far Cry 3 simply because; to engage the red flag bastions you must shoot up before hand and your fire resistant high is time limited so you must shoot up again if the literal fire fight is protracted. So for Far Cry 3 I must take off one star!

Far Cry Blood Dragon was a weird duck indeed but it was easily one of the best video games I have ever played bar none. Far Cry Blood Dragon had very limited visual effects that were often late PS2 \ early PS3 in quality. However Far Cry Blood Dragon blew me away because it was KILLER FUN! Far Cry Blood Dragon was so good I would have paid $59 for it and ran home happy as could be. Far Cry Blood Dragon was so much fun I got 100% of the available trophies a rare thing for me. Hearing the enemies all talk like the 1980's Battlestar Gallatica Cylons was also a nice touch I was pleased. I could go on forever about how much I loved Far Cry Blood Dragon but I won't. I just say Far Cry Blood Dragon was the Diamond in the rough among the three offerings here. You owe this game a serious play, get over the graphics and you will have a great time.

Now Far Cry 2. Far Cry 2 was the game that started my Far Cry love affair. I enjoyed everything about Far Cry 2 from the cars, trucks, weapons, stores where you had to buy things using that quaint old IBM clone like computer. Far Cry 2 was everything in moderation and balance and that is what made it awesome. I had no problem with the single health syringes because; hey they were simple easy to use and did not suggest addiction. You did not have to shoot up with a special mixture before going into battle. You just gave yourself a single use basic health shot if your health was failing. The syringe system was uncomplicated and a discrete part of the narrative. In Far Cry 3 the syringe system was made more complex and more addict like by creating all the special crap syringes which made the character seem far more like a junkie jones'ing for a fix. A fix for fire, a fix to dive, a fix to function. I enjoyed Far Cry 2 because; the character was not always fixin in order to perform.

Far Cry 2 had one annoying element which was the Malaria that was timed to trigger at the worse possible points in the game. At first it was fun but in time it got damned annoying. It was a small annoyance but persistent throughout the game. Also the diamonds were put in places the clunky game mechanics only barely made accessible. That said Far Cry 2 was still a very nice game when its bugs did not appear. Far Cry 2 could be glitchy but the fun made up for it if you saved often. The best way to overcome the Far Cry 2 glitch factory was to get a mission and save immediately there after especially the communications tower missions where the ability to save was not immediately available at the start point.

All in all this Far Cry compilation is a GREAT VALUE for the money with the dope addict and his rainbow of syringe types in Far Cry 3 make it the only real dud in the bunch. Far Cry Blood Dragon is Epic fun and Far Cry 2 is just a joy to play. The video quality is awesome on Far Cry 2 and 3. While the video suffers in Far Cry Blood Dragon the story and the game play more than make up for it. Even with the drag of Far Cry 3 this is still a MUST BUY game compilation at this price in my opinion. All three games entertain and are worthy of your attention.",1507852800,4

1592,110,768,"Best built in mic on any gaming headset I've tried. Mic sound coming from it sounds very natural like studio mics when testing it out with friends, and listening to it post recording. Sounds more like you're talking to someone in person rather than with someone off a radio for instance, which is good for run on sentences and lengthy commands/commentary compared to few word notification to your teammates to tell them where the enemies/objectives are

Sound coming from the headset itself are great in terms of multimedia (movies, music, TV,shows, etc), but for picking up in-game sound like footsteps and trying to deciphering distance of objects and in-game enemies are not that good.

With that said, this headset is excellent if you're a streamer (playing games on easy/normal mode) as you do not need an additional external mic setup as the one built into the headset is quite sufficient especially if you're going to talk for extended amounts of time. For in-game use, it's good for casual play or if you have poor sound depth perception to begin with and/or like to issue out commands/provide support on your team rather than being on top of the leaderboard in a match.

Tips for improving your game in terms of sound for ANY headset:
I recommend going to the sound options of the game and turn off music volume completely and max out sound effects/in-game sound.
Then go to training mode with a friend, have him/her walk around your character to judge step distance (some games varies, also may be character/hero/object dependent). Then blind fold yourself, and do a test to judge direction it's coming from.
This will improve your game sense and may rank you up in the game because of it.

Headset is very comfortable and able to wear for long hours without any discomfort. This generally depends on your head size/shape, but from myself and two friends who tried it, this is definitely the case

Controls on this headset is very minimal. There's a scroll wheel volume dial on the side which gets a bit of getting used to. Not as practical as a scroll wheel that you slide/flick with your finger for instance. I'd say best to have it on default volume all the time or if you have an amp attachment to your headset use the volume control on that instead. There's no software customization, so you have to rely on the hardware itself

Overall I'd say this headset is good for entertainment purposes i.e. streaming online or like to talk a lot in-game due to the excellent micophone. The headset sound itself is not exactly built for gaming in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it sound excellent as a stand alone headphone across all media, but it doesn't pick up exaggerated footsteps and sound depth perception like other gaming headsets do. It seems like Sennheiser initially made a high quality sounding headset and said, 'hey let's make a gaming headset without sacrificing overall quality sound across all other media'  best way they did this (or at least my theory) is to make a excellent mic that stands out for communication purposes",1507852800,4

1606,44,419,"This review is for the PS4 version.

I am pretty late to the game with AC games.  Recently, I played for the first time and completed the Ezio Collection and although there were some things I found that I didn't like about the games, I was hooked.  So, when some of the other AC games went on sale, I grabbed them, including Syndicate.

As with the other AC games, there is lots to do with the main missions, side missions and collecting stuff.  As it is with the collecting things, it does get a bit repetitive and probably the least favorite part of the game.  My least favorite of these are collecting the helix glitches which are hard to see, hard to find and a pain to collect at times with the requirement to exactly put the grapple hook in a certain area to be able to grab the glitch, in addition to looking like the fast travel icons on the map.  The find the killer side missions are fun though and something different to do in the game.  The boxing matches are fun although I found a bit glitchy as at times, the fighters get stuck on the outside of the ring.  There are the horse races which are ok but nothing particularly special.

The London landscape is detailed and well done with really good graphics.  The basic gameplay is pretty much the same as the previous games as I have played which makes it feel familiar and easy to start playing but at the same time, it feels the same as the other games with only a few new additions.

I am not big fan of multiplayer so the lack of a MP option is not a big deal for me.

With the Ezio collection, I felt that the gameplay controls were a bit awkward especially for jumping and climbing.  Syndicate seems to be much smoother in that respect, especially with the climbing that feels smooth and easy to do, although there are times that the character does something different than I expected or wanted it to do.  The one awkward thing to me is how they do the leap of faith jumps that take 3 buttons.  I really would have preferred this to be a bit more simplified.

There are lots of places to see and things to do and I really like exploring the varies areas around the city.  There are more places that you can go inside, such as the pubs and such although outside of mission specific things to do or collecting, there isn't much to do.  It would have been nice is there is more opportunity to interact with the environment and various citizens of the city.  It is cool to be able to play as either the brother or sister characters, although the abilities page is pretty much the same and there doesnt seem to be a lot of diversity in what they can do.

Although I have enjoyed playing the game, I do have a few grips though.  There are times when there are glitchy camera views that make it hard to see and do things, such as a massive tree blocking your view in the middle of a fight.  There are long loading times in various parts of the game, especially when you have to restart a mission.  Sometimes, when you need to push a button to do certain things, the game gets a bit finicky as to the specific area you need to stand to do so.  Normally that isn't a problem but when you are on a timed mission, such as the stop the train mission, this can be a bit of a pain.  The grapple gun is a cool addition to gameplay but sometimes is a pain to use as it only allows certain areas of a roof to grapple to.  I am also not a fan of the trend to pay with microtransactions to get extra stuff concept but luckily you can avoid that and still build your character without paying extra to do so.

I can see where people can be frustrated with the sameness of the series but for me, since I have only played the Ezio Collection, I am enjoying the game even with some of its flaws.

Works great with my Galaxy S5. Everything I wanted in a controller. The clip is perfect for it. It connects quickly and easily after initial setup. It has vibration. The L2/R2 keys don't give much feedback, but you won't be using those keys much outside of PS1 emulation. Still feels great.

The controller also can charge while you play. The sticks feel pretty good. The Dpad does a nice job as well. It was effective in tests involving a DS Castlevania game, Megaman Zero, and even Gundam Battle Assault 2. I wouldn't replace my Street Fighter fightpad, though.

Overall, I love it. It [Hero Power] fits in my pocket, it has a clip for the phone, it charges my phone, and it does all that while being cheaper than an 8Bitdo pro. Best part? Virtually no input lag",1508025600,5

1652,15,1186,"I really enjoyed NFS Underground when it first came out. It had loads of customization, a great soundtrack, fun levels, and a great variety of cars and upgrades. Of course, when this game first came out, I was extremely excited. The ads were very interesting, and the idea of the open-world was cool. Unfortunately, when I played this game for a few days worth of time, I felt disappointed and there were a few glaring problems for me: Awful dialogue, the cars sometimes feel as if you're driving on ice, the god-awful comic book-esque cutscenes, and a (mostly) bland soundtrack. However, I liked the (albeit very few) new cars, the drift mode in this game with the opponent cars drifting with you, the beautiful visuals, and the short load times. As a standalone game, it's not that bad or anything, but as a sequel to one of my all-time favorite racing games (next to GT3 and ATV2), it felt as if EA took two steps forward and three steps back.",1508112000,3

1656,454,1187,"My frist impression with the PS4 as when this bundle came out was outstanding. I'm sure most games weren't using the console's specs to its max when it first came out so, early games were not so bad at all. I know some games felt like they were upscaled to run well but, Sony has brought their exclusive games to a hard role for the studios to keep up. Overall great console but, my only gripe is that it doesn't play Blurays like the XBOX One can. Sometimes the controller has issues connecting if you have multiple PS4's in your home or if you bring your controller to friends homes to play with and it is an issue majority of the times.

Highlights:

- Great New generation
- Quality of game graphics is amazing
- Sony Services are good as usual
- Can swap hard drives
- White colored console

Downfalls:
- Bluetooth on controllers can't connect sometimes
- Can't play Blurays when i had mines",1508198400,4

After several years, the anxiously awaited Gran Turismo has finally been released for current gen systems on the PlayStation 4. I've been a fan of this franchise since the original release on the PS1 days back in '97. With each development release, the game has continued to grow & improve in my opinion. Gran Turimso Sport finally brings amazing racing simulation, and stunning graphics to the current generation for the 20th Anniversary of the franchise. However, there are some major changes that may not sit well with veterans of the game. The game seems to take a slight step backwards, and doesn't seem very revolutionary this time around. The ""Sport"" in Gran Turismo Sport is positioned as an e-Sport it seems. There's also a significant lack of cars and tracks, compared to other title offerings on the market like Project Cars 2 & Forza Motorsport 7.

Gran Turismo Sport looks & plays absolutely incredible on the PlayStation 4 Pro, on a Curved 4K UHD TV with HDR enabled! Polyphony Digital has recreated every car in fantastic intricate & exquisite detail, both inside and out. I could literally spend hours just looking at every single car, examining each one and soaking in the gorgeous eye candy. Although there are some other excellent titles released for racing on the current gen platform, Gran Turismo is the gold standard when it comes to visuals in this genre. The tracks and scenery are given extreme detail treatment as well, with lighting, shadows, glare, smoke, and particle effects making everything seem genuinely real (of course). GTS shines when compared to the likes of Project Cars 2 (for example).

One of my favorite things that I absolutely positively love about GT Sport (and Gran Turismo in general), is that it teaches me how to drive. It thoroughly explains, and shows in tutorial videos what needs to be done to successfully complete it's driver's school training course. This has not only helped me drive and race better in the game, but it's given me in-depth understanding & insight into the physics of driving in the real world. To me this is one of the most attractive features of this game, and it's a hallmark of the franchise. There's incentive to complete the training too, as it gives experience to level up your GTS account, and it'll also reward you with a gift after each block of training is passed.

There is a large variety of unique cars represented in game, spanning from classes Gr. N (Stock Production), Gr. 4 (Base Level Racing), Gr. 3 (GT3 or equivalent), Gr. 1 (Prototype), Gr. B (Rally), and finally Gr. X (Experimental Concept). Each class is then further branched off into smaller divisions of horsepower from N100 to N1000 in the Gr. N category, but the others adhere to  the strict racing standards set in the real world criteria. With over 160 cars appearing in the game at launch, there's a lot to choose from to suit your fancy. All cars are precisely detailed inside & out. According to series creator Kazunori Yamauchi, the final number of cars for the game will eventually be around 400 to 500. Yamauchi has stated that these additional cars will also be provided in free DLC, and there will not be any micro-transactions included.

The game features three major game modes: Campaign, Sports Mode, and Arcade Mode. The game gives the best experience when it's connected for online play. Arcade Mode will be the only option available if you're unable to connect to the internet (offline), and the game will not progress while playing offline either... so be aware of that new limitation. The franchise's staple offline Career Mode is now gone. The game will also not feature dynamic weather, or a day/night cycle; Track conditions are chosen in the menu. GT Sport also features VR support, and I'll edit my review further when I'm finally able to test out that aspect of the gameplay.

With regards to Career Mode, and the lack of any offline option of itwhich has been a staple of the core structure of the game since it debuted. It seems that GT Sport may be aligning itself more towards the e-Sport aspect of online competitive gaming. Everything you do with leveling up for your profile is attributed to the majority experience of racing in the various modes. Leveling-up is important, because it'll unlock more tracks for you to race on. At Level-20 you'll eventually unlock the famed Nrburgring track for example. Arcade Mode is all about racing against A.I. opponents in Single Race, Timed Trial, 2-Player Battle, etc. Campaign Mode is about Driving School, Racing Etiquette, Circuit Experience, and also Mission Challenges. Sport Mode is where racing online comes into play (especially competitively); you'll be judged on your driving skill, driver level, and most importantly your driving etiquette. I'm personally okay all of these changes, but I suspect many veterans of the series may be left reeling from the hollow feeling of such a change, from the tried and true formula that fans have come know and love.

I've played the game on both the Dual Shock 4 (DS4) controller, and the Logitech G29 Racing Wheel. Needless to say, the racing wheel gives the absolute best simulation, feedback, and experience for racing. A racing wheel makes the game feel and play completely differentit's a thrilling heart-pounding experience to say the least. Although the game can easily be played on the DS4 controller, I highly recommend using the KontrolFreek Speed Freek thumb-stick for better control, and smoother gameplay; You'll thank me later for that recommendation. Overall this game needs to be played with the racing wheel, and it's fantastic how much fun & thrilling it feels to be immersed in the driving experienceit's phenomenal. The game won't punish you for using the DS4 though, so don't let me turn you off from that prospectyou can make adjustments to fine tune your settings.

This game has a lot to offer the casual racer, and hardcore enthusiast alike though. I highly recommend GT Sport, it's a game that needs to be in your library if you're passionate about the genre. The game is great for the novice racer, and as I mentioned aboveit'll teach you everything you need to know to get racing. GT Sport seems to offer less when compared to Project Cars 2 and Forza 7 Motorsport in my opinion, so it may be difficult to justify getting this title. Especially knowing that GT Sport has drastically changed it's game formula, in lieu of e-Sports and online competitive play. However, knowing that Polyphony Digital will be providing free DLC, and a massive livery of new cars and tracks... it's worth considering nonetheless.

I give the game two thumbs way up! The racing experience feels great, it's visually stunning and aurally pleasing. However with other titles with better options on the market, this may a wait-to-buy prospect for some. I'm very happy with my purchase though, and I think GT Sport is a terrific game. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off from this game. GT Sport is about the racing experience & simulation, and it delivers on that statement in my opinion.",1508198400,5

I was hoping something new like a boss battle Run or I am the night mode from Arkham Origins. But it's literally a port to current gen. The difference in the graphic is very slight change.

The controls take some getting use to but are logical. You can heal easily, fight easily, move easily. Check inventory is easy. No problem here.

ELEX is more about exploring and RPG than combat and graphics. Combat seems fine, although I keep running out of stamina while swinging my old iron bar!

These cards are overpriced and should be completely unnecessary. That being said, I didn't even really get to use this product very much because the PS Vita I was using refused to read it. I doubt that it was the card, probably just the fact that the PS Vita was an older one and just didn't want to work since they seem to have a reputation for being finicky and hackable. I sent the card back and returned the system to the store I bought it from and went with a Nintendo 3DS XL. At least it takes normal micro SD cards. I'm sure the product itself works fine though.",1508198400,3

8/10",1508198400,4
1674,461,1197,"This is where I feel the LOK (Legacy of Kain) series should have started.  Bucking the trend of its predecessor, Soul Reaver is a hack and slash adventure game, where you take on the role of Raziel in order to seek revenge on your evil master, Kain.

The story follows after the bad ending of Blood Omen.  Kain has turned the once proud world of Nosgoth into a barren wasteland of torment and decay.  And he has raised a small band of vampire sons.  The first and most loyal of these is Raziel.  But when Raziel grows wings, and therefore outshines his master, things turn south real fast.  Kain is outraged at this, rather than proud.  He destroys Raziel's wings and throws him into a pit to oblivion.  An eternity later, Raziel is awakened by the Elder, basically the God of the world, and is sent on a quest to slay his demonic brothers, kill Kain, and set things right.

A much stronger story this go around, now let's see if the gameplay holds up just as well.

Like I said, SR is an action adventure game where Raziel must run, jump, glide, and fight his way to his destiny with Kain.  He'll gradually gain new abilties, which affect things in either the material realm or the spirit realm.  Raziel will have to switch between both to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles to advance.  Here's a quick rundown of these abilities.

Faze Through Gates (Spirit World Only) Raziel can faze through gates to get to areas he normally can't.

Soul Reaver (both worlds): basically a sword Raziel can use to dish out major pain on his enemies, but he can only use it if his health is full.  There is an issue with this, but we'll come to that later.

Wall crawling (Material World Only) : Allows Raziel to climb certain walls and get to areas he normally can't.

Force Projectile: (both worlds) Allows Raziel to shoot energy balls at no cost to anything, which can be used to knock pesky enemies into their doom, or to stun them.

Swimming (Material world only): Before getting this, diving into water will automatically revert Raziel to the spirit world, but after you get this, no more of that.

Constrict (both worlds) Allows Raziel to spin things that cannot be spun otherwise, or to crush his enemies.

All of these abilities must be used to overcome the obstacles.  There are also hidden glyphs that give Raziel new powers.  Think of them as special moves which can be helpful in a pickle but cost magic to use.

Combat can be fun but some enemies can either zap you from off screen, jump around you as you're trying to fight them, or both, and that can be annoying, especially when dealing with multiple enemies at once.  I'll just say get used to getting booted to the spirit world.  And this is where the Soul REaver comes in.  LIke I said you can only use it at full health, so if you're dealing with annoying enemies, you can lose it when you really need it.  Enemies are not truly dealt with unless they are burned by fire, impaled on spikes, or thrown in water.  There are other weapons around that can help keep the pace of the game going, but if you use a weapon on an enemy, you must reap his soul before you can pick it up again, other wise he'll get up instantly and you have to redo killing him.

But it's easy to accidentally pick up the weapon when you're trying to punch the other enemies.  In general, combat can be fun, but be prepared for some frustration.  And yes, Raziel needs to absorb souls to regain his health.  He needs to do this in both worlds, as he cannot go back to the material world unless his heath ls full.

So far, Soul Reaver offers a pretty fun experience with just a few flaws that hold it back.  Two more flaws come to mind.  First off, controls are a bit stuff, as it's easy to accidentally walk into a wall and not being able to move until you change direction.  Annoying, but not gamebreaking.  The final flaw I have is that sometimes you have to pull levers, open doors, etc.  Raziel does not always do this when you ask him to, so be prepared to punch the air and such before he stops goofing off and pulls the lever, opens the door, etc.

AS for presentation, that's a bit of a mixed bag.  The visuals are really dark and I had to crank up the brightness on my TV to be able to see what I was doing.  But the voice acting, music, and level design are all very well done, and the characters compliment each other well.  The music really gets you in the mood, but it is kind of forgettable.

In the end, Soul Reaver is a much better outing than Blood Omen, and I would urge you to grab a copy if you can find one for cheap.  If you have a PS3, the game is avalible on the PlayStation store for six bucks.  Whatever you gotta do, play this game.",1508198400,5

1688,319,1207,"This is an amazing mouse. I was kind of nervous at first because I heard the Rival 100 sensor was only usable at 500 CPI or below. WEll, the Rival 110 has a custom sensor called the ""TrueMove1"" which was made by SteelSeries and Pixart, and is capable of 7200 CPI. I personally use it at 1600 and it works amazing! It's not a Deathadder Elite class sensor, but it's close.

The design is pretty straight forward. It's an ambidextrous design, although you only have forward and back buttons on the left side of the mouse. You get your usual right and left click, forward and back, scroll wheel, scroll click and DPI button. On top of that you do have RGB Lighting, which looks amazing. Colors are very bright and crisp.

Now the performance. It tracks pixel by pixel, and is very smooth. It's performing close to a PMW3360 which is a top optical sensor. I've only owned this mouse for a few hours now, so if anything new comes up I will edit this review.

The story feels like a knock off movie, and the words do not follow the characters mouths. The animations are awful and to see twitching breasts on the female characters is so distracting. I can see where the developers wanted to let you do your own thing in a huge open world like that of Fallout or The Witcher 3, but you will be constantly dying over and over because the combat is way off. You can't even use the special attack when fighting, you have to be completely still, and even then, you'll die. It feels like a very cheap game, but on the other hand I want to keep playing it. I have refunded the game 3 times Via steam, and now I have decided not to touch it anymore. It is just a weird game that I can't say I like or dislike. It's like a 60% of it I hate and 40% of it I like. If your a Piranha Bytes fan, you'll love it, but being the first game of theirs I have tried, I can't recommend it.",1508371200,3
1709,233,1201,"January 2018 update:
The backlash begins.

Not worth it unless you have PSN+, which is required to play online.  It looks like 90% of the content is reserved for online racing.  There are no championship cups to win credits and cars like in the old games.  So fans of prior games in the series are going to be very unhappy.  UPDATE: patch 1.10 gave us a bunch of old school cup races to challenge the AI.  And the AI of cpu controlled cars is better than before.  Added a star to rating.

I have been trying to get the 500,000 bonus credits for pre-ordering from amazon for the past 2 days without success.  At least the bonus 3 car pack did work.  Anyway I am disappointed that amazon did not give all the promised rewards for pre-ordering.  UPDATE: the bonuses were eventually awarded, better late than never.

On the plus side I am hearing good things about the online racing.  Graphics are top notch and cars drive really well.  If they were to add some free dlc with a traditional single player mode the game could be saved.

UPDATE: game is still held back by a lack of content vs Forza and the online requirement for game saves.",1508371200,3

1714,325,1081,"I have mixed feelings about this skin. On the positive side, it looks good once you get it on. It stays on pretty well (so far). It doesn't just do the top, it does the sides and the entire front in addition to the top. The quality is good, the image doesn't look blurry or anything. It's pretty generous when you have to pull it off to readjust it. On the negative side, the controller skin is kind of hard to line up. The main skin for the top was pretty hard to put on straight. This was partially due to how large it is, the back will get stuck when you are trying to line up the front. I'm not convinced that it is sized properly, as it is a little too wide so part of it hangs off the edge. Very irritating, but not as irritating as how bubbles keep forming when you are trying to get it on. I spent waaay too long trying to get it on smoothly and properly. As for the image itself, it's fine with the exception that the the woman on it shows too much cleavage. The skin would have looked much better if she had had a colorful kimono or something instead. All-in-all, I would say that this skin is worth getting if you like the design. Just be prepared to have some frustration getting it on.",1508371200,4

1723,169,185,"Since Ezio, no AC production (including Unity) was able to make me emotionally attached to the protagonist and the whole story, until this one showed up. Honestly, it had a bumpy start because I wasn't impressed with the graphics in the first memory and the storyline wasn't really appealing yet. But it soon proved me wrong.
There are too many cool things about Black Flag, but here's the coolest: The protagonist is a total bad-ass (of course), and yet, he's not even part of the Assassins! Instead, he's just the legendary CAPTAIN KENWAY which is a title more awesome than any Assassin honestly. Yes, he goes around and assassinate people in cold blood, but that doesn't take away the pirate inside him, and that's what makes him such a fun guy to play with!
Now, I have synchronized about 90%, highest ever among all the AC games I've played, and the reason is because I just can't get my hands off this game long after completing the main storyline. Normally, I wouldn't even bother to try to finish the side missions because I would get bored so quickly, but with this one I can just go on and on.
And I think a major factor is the efficiency of the map. It's a huge map with so many locations available for you to explore, and yet, it's so easy and convenient to get to these places with ""fast travel"" or just fun sailing times on the ocean.
So there you go, go explore it yourself because you WILL regret it if you don't play Black Flag. Happy Pirating!",1508371200,5

1733,477,9,"I got this game in a bundle with my ps4 and the campaign was so much and completely addicting. There's a nightmare mode of the campaign with the undead instead of the campaign enemies which is also fun.  I thought multiplayer was fun with the specialists at first, until I played the new Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered the multiplayer is amazing and puts shame to the black ops 3 MP. Being stuck as a ""specialist"" and all the players limited to just them is so totally redundant and boring, It is the only flaw I can find in the game. The multiplayer maps for free for all, deathmatch, etc are pretty horrible in comparison to the MW4 maps, even the DLC sucks and you feel ripped off with the DLC maps.

Most likely gonna be collecting dust in its case until I get totally bored with the call of duty 4 remaster and infinite warfare. With only weeks away from Call of Duty WW2 getting really excited for that, it looks amazing since my favorite part of the campaign was the ww2 type missions.",1508457600,4

In terms of physical design it is very good. Tom Nook stands on his own without a transparent prop. I like the cross hatch detail on his sweater. He has a large protruding belly which is a nice touch seeing most other amiibo tend to go for the perfect body or super cartoony look.

Main DLC for this amiibo are for Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival and Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer. All other games (mentioned later) are just read only cosmetic dlc.

-Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival
Store save data for the game. Great when playing with friends on different systems
After each match you can save the Happy Points you've collected to your amiibo figure. Save enough points up and you can even unlock new costumes for your character.

-Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer:
Help Tom Nook Design his dream house
Use Amiibo Phone to communicate with him
After you've completed your design, you can save the furniture items you used to the character's card and share them with a friend.

-In terms of other games, you basically get saved ghost data, random common loot drops (sometimes daily), and/or unlockable costumes depending on the game. Here is the list of games compatible with the Amiibo as if this review:

Amiibo Tap : Nintendo Greatest Bits
Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival

1840,501,1278,"South Park continues its irreverent and hilarious exploration of video game norms, turning every one on its head. Difficulty is determined by skin tone, ability buffs by fidget spinners, combat by farts and ""pew pew pew"" sounds the kids yell at each other. And you can die and lose in the first 3 minutes.

Combat has changed to a grid based, individual turn driven setup. You're starting classes gradually grow and morph as you establish your superhero backstory, and rather than grind up levels, you gain titles, ability mods and changes to overall strength and strategy by artifacts and other unlocks. This gives not a good reason, but more of a reason to collect friends, use every toilet, and otherwise complete what would otherwise be the normal scattering of fetch quests.

The story continues to deliver on all cylinders. The Coon, noticing a $100 reward for a lost cat, calls off the D&D Stick of Truth game to paly superheroes instead, as Coon & Friends has to overpower the SuperFriends superhero franchise by collecting more sponsors and Coonstagram followers.

Graphics and Sound are South Park standard, with awesome comic style cutaways and jokes pounded into every frame.

As for drawbacks, I genuinely can't find any that matter. Its irritating to walk past areas to can't access because you haven't collected the right story tool, such as the red Lego brick lava, but its not far enough out of the way to be an actual problem. Character development feels slightly stilted to start with, but that's more due to a steady diet of JRPG and Action-Adventure standards than anything else.

Probably the only thing that would've made this better would've been a form of multiplayer, but if this was consumable by a wider audience this would easily be contending for GOTY.",1508889600,5
1841,456,1278,"Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are excellent for what they do. A quirky, yet funny, and progressive humor in their series and evidently in this game.

Ive never laughed so hard during a video game! For example, when you're choosing the difficulty between easy (white), and hard (black). Its small things like this that are so effective of weeding out people who are overtly sensitive to the sun, wheat allergies, and pretty much everyone.

Southpark creators stated in an interview that they hated everyone equally.

Regardless, I love how well they did with the graphical implementation of their actual southpark world. Ive always wondered what certain aspects of southpark looked like. Within this game, I feel like I see behind the scenes to a show and group of characters weve come to love.

If you're having a bad day, don't forget to pizza. Or else you're going to have a bad time. (Say this is helpful if you get the reference).

If you don't like it, then I hope someone pounds your monkey hole.

Despite the irony I presented. I really enjoy this game, it was a great break from the norm of FPS, and horror games.

There are some good points, the options menu allows for some nice game control such as no zombies, daylight length and extra loot. It is an Ok game. Biggest thing Id like to see changed is the base walking speed and lighting. The sprint speed should be the walking speed.

The leveling system is nice and also the fact that you can pick different costumes for your characters is so neat because, many people love different play styles and different play styles means customizing your characters looks. Definitely a fun and must have FPS game especially for kids since this one isn't gory at all.",1509235200,5
1933,110,464,"Story.

Plot and theme is similar to a Pinocchio or Blade Runner where an intelligent non-human species (Andriods in this case) created by humans question if they have a soul, and  contemplate if their memories considers them sentient beings and on par with humans.

Story goes like this: aliens invade earth with robots or machines, and humans have to escape and colonate on the moon where they build Androids and send them out to eradicate the robots. The majority of robot have low IQ but are very abundant. Throughout the story you play 3 of these Androids set on missions to destroy these robots for the humans.

Story comes in 3 acts and can be philosophical at times, especially when the protagonists see robots do things of intelligent nature or things outside their designated roles . First act focuses on Android 2B, and the second act plays out the same as the first one except you're in the perspective of Android 9S. The gameplay is not exactly the same as 9S has a hacking mechanic, and during the first act, the two get separated at points. When the two stories intersect you do get similar dialogue. Third act continues from the ending of the first and second, and introduces a third character you can play as. Unlike the first two acts you switch between characters instead of focusing on one. All three acts can last 25+ hours depending on difficulty you select, and how many side quests you decided to do

-Gameplay.

A combination of open world hack-and-slash (similar to Bayonetta or DMC) and shmup (shoot em' up) of the bullet hell variety.

I like how they mix the two gameplay styles very well in terms of pacing them out, with different viewing angles (top down, side scoller, free roam, etc), and mini-games to keep you very intrigued without being dull and repetitive. Also the upgrade skill and weapon mechanic keep things interesting also.
so
The world is big, but you'll be traversing the same areas from time-to-time especially when playing a new acts. So same sandbox, different story

There are tons of invisible walls, rubble, buildings, and restricted doors/chests/elevators that block your progress. For the first 3 it can be frustrating especially when you have to go around them and take the scenic route especially when you're focused on the objective marker. For the latter 3 those are restricted via story progression or specific character unlocks.

Once you get familiar with the world, and when they introduce the teleport checkpoint mechanic; you get used to it and its less of an annoyance

Difficulty level range from ridiculously easy to impossible. On easy mode, the characters you play dodge on their own so it's only the matter of positioning yourself well and button mashing without consequence. Good for those who just want to experience the story.  Hardest mode is one hit kill form any enemy with no auto dodge, so you have to get used to being a glass cannon, or have to constantly restart from where you last saved.

-Presentation

Graphics are really good and frame rate is smooth throughout. Personally, I don't like the dark green, grey and white color scheme as it reminds me the early days of the PS3, Xbox 360 era, but the art direction is excellent

Music is excellent with orchestral music

Voice acting is also really good. Only tried the default English since the Japanese voice track can be distracting since characters have conversations during combat, and this game is very twitch and timed (button presses) heavy especially on high difficulty settings.

Characters are good, the main characters play out well acting like androids with a conscious and talk like real people. Villains can be over dramatic, but don't go into the cliche territory. Each character has their own personality and maybe aside from the villains; not one dimensional and you can see the motives behind their personality

-PSN trophies

Easy platinum.

After you complete the 3 main acts, you can purchase trophies via in-game money, or get them the natural way.

If you do the former, I would make multiple save files and save over them once you make the trophy purchase(s) (since it autosaves*) to minimize money grinding. Steps:

1. Before making purchase make 2 or 3 same save files. Play one save file and make a lot of purchases
2. Load a fresh save
3. Save over the auto save file
4. Make more purchases
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you sold out of all purchasable trophies

After you've done that, you have two more trophies to collect (non purchasable) which are the

'Leaving for the New World' or 'Beautiful World' (depending on which ending you select in act 3, have to replay via chapter select and pick the other one), and the 'The Minds That Emerged' trophy that technically deletes your save file. If you wait on the option screen for 'yes' and 'no' for a few seconds, the trophy along with platinum trophy will pop up and you can select 'no' if you want

*Only time the game auto saves. All other times you have to save via designated safe zones (that doesn't interfere with plot/story), or vending machines

Overall, a blast to play with gameplay variety and good story.

The story is interesting enough, and the characters are likable.

1947,314,1335,"Ive only tried these on a ps1&2.
When I received these i tested it for a while and I received some mixed results.
When tried on a ps2 it worked incredibly well. Its sharp, clear and the audios pretty good. It worked well for games like Red Dead Revolver, Metal Gear solid 2, The Warriors and worked incredibly well with ps1 games too especially when using the smoother. The only set back o saw from ps1 games on the ps2 was that they had a slight checkerboard pattern. You cant notice it from a distance on smaller monitors but you might on bigger ones. The checkedboard patter also happens a bit on ps2 games but nowhere near as often as on ps1 gamss.

Now when i tested it on a ps1 it acted a bit strange. For the first 5 mins it worked fine but then the letters on the screen started shaking a lot. Also its pretty hard to put the plug inside the port behind the ps1. I had to jiggle it left and right a bit like you normally would with a key that doesnt want to fit through a hole.

Now a few days later I purchased a Sony Branded PS3 S-video cable and tried it on my ps2.
It worked amazingly well. I put a ps1 game in and the checkerboard pattern was gone completely.
When i tried it on a ps1 however it did gave me the same results as it did with the the 3rd party cable but not as often. I think its because the port might be dusty so i most likely have to clean it out a bit.

These 3rd party cables weren't that bad when compared to the Sony Branded cables. I think id rather use the sony branded cable on the ps1 since it slided in much easier then with the 3rd party cable.

Would I recommend this?
For a ps2 its not a bad alternative but keep in mind here and there you might see a slight checkered but its not entirely noticeable.
Ps1 on the other hand im not sure. Ill see what results i get later on.",1509235200,4

The story telling off this game was quite awkward and the characters all act awkward, new games these days shows better emotions and facial expressions in so many levels. FFXV felt like they made this while FFXIII was being made which could be true, but the way the characters move all look stiff during gameplay, but more relaxed while in cinematic. The fighting and combat system here has a bit of FFXIII mixed with Kingdom Hearts with it. I know Final Fantasy series loves to make their play style strategic but, I still feel stiff overall since most of my time playing and enjoying the game is really killing monsters most of the time.",1509235200,4

1961,515,1341,"Spoiler Free Review:

Simply put, this is the best Tomb Raider game. Reminiscent of the Uncharted series without the wit, this game provides a gripping story, amazing graphics, and smooth gameplay. Tomb Raider has come a long way since the bouncing days, and now we have a strong female protaganist and fulfulling secondary characters. Once I started playing I couldn't stop, and had a couple of late nights.

Campaign takes about 24 hrs to get all of the pick-ups, DLC Blood Lines is worth it while Laura's Nightmare is not. Blood Lines provides excellent story background and the ability to tour Croft Manor. Laura's Nightmare is it's own take on a Zombie shootout but is not very fullfullling. The only down side to this game is the use of ""cards"" and is essentially meaningless for after campaign gameplay.

Once the campaign is over there is replayability with higher difficulty settings, speed runs which this game does an excellent job organizing, and endurance challanges - survival modes and the like.

Rating: 9 out of 10. Highly Recommended.

1967,515,1344,"Spoiler Free Review:

Come on, how can there be spoilers for game that is almost two decades old.

Nostalgia is a powerful force, and this game brings it back full throttle. Age of Empires 2 has a cult following for sure, it was a masterpiece at its time  everyone played it, Im not going to delve into that so much as a comparison to the HD version, and if it is worth playing now.

Lets start with the HD  there is nothing HD about this. Graphics may be polished, but it is nothing compared to AOE3 or StarCraft, or any other comparable RTS  the game still shows its age. The AI has been improved from what I remember of the original, and several times in the single player campaigns I had to restart because I wasn't fast enough and the AI has me in a corner. The gameplay challenges have been welcomed and aren't frustrating.

The issues that plagued the original are still present, troop movement being one. You have to carefully monitor your army and not send them across the map in one move. AI movement still causes troops to get separated from the pack, or take a pretty stupid route. The rock paper scissors mechanics are still in effect (send pikemen to horses - swordsmen to pikemen  etc).

Some other changes that the HD version brings include map size, population limit increase, and where this game is really shining  new civilizations. The new expansions include civilizations and single player campaigns that equal the original. They did a fantastic job of keeping the feel of the original, but adding in the different content that sets it apart. In the mind of this reviewer, the DLCs are totally worth it. The population increase has also been welcomed. I tend to turtle during single player games and being able to open the gates of Mordor and flood the map is very satisfying.

AOE2 at the time was the number 1 game out and became a classic. Fan outcry brought it back full force, and I have to say it is just as enjoyable as I remember. How much of that is nostalgia and how much is actual good game mechanics is up for debate, but I find myself pouring hours and hours back into a game, that is still around after almost 20 years.

Rating: 8 out of 10. Highly Recommended.

1978,539,1189,"l will list the pros and cons for the game, but if you want a short read: ALL BAD IS MADE UP BY THE GOOD.

Pros and cons (starting with cons)

CONS:
A LOT LESS CARS. gran turismo 6 had i think around 1200 cars.(correct me if im wrong) this however has a LOT less cars.

NO MORE TUNING SHOP. honestly this isn't too much of a con, considering you CAN upgrade your cars using the level up in car settings, but it doesnt cost money, it costs mileage points.

A LOT LESS TRACKS.there are not very many tracks. the number is so small it makes me sad. no more Daytona, De La Sarthe, Spa, not even the special stage where the track is straight for like 9 miles. honestly very dissapointed.

LONG LOADING TIMES. loading times are not that bad but it still is a little bit annoying.

LACK OF CAR DIVERSITY. all cars are either race cars or sporty street cars. with only a small number of crappy hatchbacks or whatever. AND there is only ONE car that is older than 2009.

ONLINE. the game is only online. and it sucks. the driving school, mission challenges and some other thing that I forgot the name of is not online however. neither the arcade mode.

NO B-SPEC. I am very lazy. i like to just set a driver on a race and then go do something else while the dude is racing. well, I can't do that anymore.

PROS:
MILEAGE POINTS. some people might not like them, but I, however, DO. you get them from driving. the longer you drive for, the more you get. its kind of a new currency. you can use them to buy new paint colors, like for example chrome. and you can also get different decals, driving suits and helmets, special cars you can't get from the dealership, driver poses, and rims. it is actually VERY cool when you view the game as NOT gran turismo 6.

GRAPHICS. now i thought the graphics where going to not be as good because i only have a standard PS4. but I was VERY wrong. the graphics are awesome. not amazing, but MUCH better than gran turismo 6.

CAR AND TRACK QUALITY. following on the whole graphics thing, there is an amazing amount of detail to each car and track.

DRIVING SCHOOL AND MISSION RACES. these are thing you can do NOT online. they are actually pretty fun.

ARCADE MODE. arcade mode is awesome in this game. before, it was just racing for fun. now, you can earn money, daily miles, mileage points, and experience points from arcade mode, AND you can change the penalties, number of laps, how many minutes/hours you want to race for, number of cars, what position you start in, difficulty, mechanical damage, tire wear, and fuel consumption. its awesome.

GAME FEEL. I think this game feels awesome. it would probably be better if i had a wheel but whatever.

RACING FLAGS. if you, or somebody else crashes, you will see a yellow flag go up. if everything is fine, its green. AND the AI racers will slow down near a crash. just a cool little feature.

NEW TIRE TYPE. in the past, the best tires you can get where racing:soft tires. now there is racing:super soft tires. its pretty sweet.

LIVERY. it is awesome!

SUMMARY:
I could go on and on about this, but I don't want to spoil too much. the whole thing with the upgrades is you CAN upgrade the car. you have to go into car settings, and you will see either one or two things that say level up. one is for upgrading power. and the other is for weight reduction. you can't upgrade your cars with money however, it takes mileage points. you don't need to buy better tires for your cars either, its just there and you can switch to it. READ THIS: I had a problem with the game screen not completely filling the tv screen. the solution is you have to exit the game, go into playstation settings, screen and audio, and adjust the thing to fit your screen. in the game you can earn XP, mileage points, and I think even money from completing achievements. playing with people online is ok. its not the greatest. when online, you can only use the car you are currently using. you cant change while in the server (at least i don't think so). overall, you should buy this game. it IS actually fun. ITS NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS IF YOU KEEP IN MIND THATS IT IS NOT GRAN TURISMO 6, AND THAT IS IS STILL A VERY NEW GAME AND COULD GET BETTER WITH UPDATES AND STUFF.

1985,543,1353,"This thing is a dinosaur from an almost bygone era of when single player games were still king, co-op was novel yet welcome and the market wasn't over-saturated with CRAP (or did it START the rather downward era we live in today?)...and yet I took the chance to re-buy this bulletproof monstrosity to reaffirm that it was in fact my favorite console growing up despite in maybe even BECAUSE of the console's many flaws. Half of my would be 'top ten' games were included in the original Xbox's library, and I'm so happy to be revisiting them all once again in an age of disappointment on the PS4, XBOX One and Switch. By no means am I calling the Xbox the best console out there nor am I saying it has the best library...but both are my favorite in each category. The used one I ordered feels like its got weight to get rid of in dust alone, the disc tray is sticky and sometimes doesn't open and the thing kicks up a bigger racket than I remember from the fan probably overheating...but it works and works well! I probably got lucky, but I'm happy that I got one that worked in the end. I mean how could you not love playing Star Wars Battlefront 1 and 2, KotOR 1 and 2, Fable and Halo 1 and 2 among many others all over again? Think about it...I'm having more fun with a game I've played a hundred times already than I am anything brand-spanking new? Sure, give it time and the XBOX One marketplace will have all the golden oldies or will be patched to support your old Original discs, but why wait or even buy that overpriced XBOX One or One S just for that chance? Anyway...I typed this while sick and after a Friday the 13th marathon on Halloween so I may have gotten carried away...but I love this damn console. I only really give it one less star than it probably deserves cuz it has a controller pictured and whether it said so or not (which I didn't read to be fair) it did not actually come with one and I had to buy one off a friend. But still, get this damn dinosaur egg and a controller and you'll have yourself a fine Jurassic Park in no time~",1509408000,4
1986,543,1354,"It's KotOR...probably the best Star Wars THING outside of Empire (or maybe even better depending on your views) and it has aged rather well in my opinion. The copy I got was even less glitchy then the original I had as a tween so that's worth an extra star in my book. The game is way shorter than I remember but that translates into a good thing for me as you can beat it's still rather meaty campaign in just over twenty hours if you know what you are doing, and it never feels like it overstays it's welcome unlike games today like Mass Effect: Andromeda. Not to mention the plot is still godly despite a couple minor nitpicks I now noticed on my adult return to this game. I just beat it and am already ready to replay it all over again. Side note: it is hard to play this game on a Dark Side run unless you got an iron stomach for certain scenes. In my opinion playing either Light or Dark Side is WAY easier and even more fun in KotOR 2. The only thing that almost ruined the game for me is the canon lore you learn of in the recent MMO The Old Republic nearly destroys any good feeling you have about the first two games (and the second game almost did that anyway but at least in a cool if not dark way)...also the game might not have a canon anymore anyway thanks to Disney but I could see that as either a good or bad thing at this point. It's KotOR, still a valuable RPG Star Wars game from when Bioware was just starting to REALLY kick ass with this, Jade Empire and early Mass Effect (never played Baldur's Gate but I might get to that another time) so play this friggin' game...and play it over and over and over and then play KotOR 2",1509408000,5

This thing feels clunky, and having to plug in another controller just to use this beast is a bit cumbersome, but for the money it is an okay product I guess. Just okay.

1995,542,432,"It's certainly not the strongest in the Star Ocean series, however it's not the weakest either.
I got major SO3 vibes from this game and it felt great to control your character. At first, I thought the multiple characters would cause gameplay issues (like being too distracting or making the game lag) but they pulled it off really well. It feels like everyone has a place and everyone contributes in their own special way.
In order to optimize your team, without using a strategy guide or walkthrough, you're going to have to spend hours in preparation. A lot of people may be turned off by this, but I loved the planning and execution mechanics this added. You'd really be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring this part of the game by using a guide.
Still, this game does have two pretty significant weaknesses. The first is the main story isn't very large. This isn't the problem, per se, as the hours upon hours of sidequests make up for that, however this does mean there's not a lot of exploration. The world map is *very* small. The second problem is they referenced the previous games far too heavily, especially in the character aspect. They mixed and matched characters from previous games to make the characters you play as in this game. The major problem with this is none of the characters feel natural or intuitive (except Emmerson) and they never took into consideration how mixing those characters might also mix and confuse the themes those characters represent. In the end, none of the characters really feel new or like they have their own style, contrary to previous Star Ocean games, even SO4.",1509408000,4

2038,410,1384,"I give this item 3 stars bc i'm not sure my whole headset audio experience got any better, the sound that comes thru the device is kind treble high even on the bass setup sound is a lot different from the xbox one adapter i had attach to the control, with the xbox one adapter the sound was more real in the lower end, (mind u i have a 3.5 jack on my controller) i plug the adapter bc the (Turtle Beach XO Three - Headset) i have only has an inline control that controls chat & game volumen at the same time & i wanted to have control of both & it does not have voice monitoring which is annoying not been able to hear yourself while u talk in chat, (used to my old TB for xbox360 i could hear myself on chat, personal preference) so the adapter came in handy to remedy that but once plug in i notice the difference in audio it dropped by 50% (xbox one adapter) & it sounded more mono than stereo so i decided to call Turtle Beach to see if their adapter could fix all that & to get the voice monitoring for chat i was told that yes it would fix my issues & i would be able to control game & chat volume separately so i bought the TB adapter, now i plug the (TB - Turtle Beach - Ear Force Headset Audio Controller Plus - Superhuman Hearing) thing in and i go into one of my shooters game & i can hear myself on the chat  but the sound of the game change once again it feel really weird full of high's, pretty much in any of the preset setting which they're 4 (neutral, bass, treble -bass, voice enhance) i try all 4 and the sound difference in all is minimal u can't barely distinct one from the other it just gets a bit louder in bass & treble-bass specially when u turn on the superhuman hearing thing on but when is off not much difference, sound is very metal like nothing like the sound of the headset by them self without the adapter so if all this extra $40.00 all it did give me control of volumes by jeopardizing sound quality i don't see the point of the adapter it should've improve the experience not diminished, i don't know what will improve it maybe i need to get the pro adapter but i'm affair is going to be more of the same or maybe the issue is the headset not design to be compatible with this adapter or any other who knows, not calling TB again, (the tech i spoke with had no expertise and use as reference the description of the adapter on their website to answer my question, if the headset was compatible with the adapter?, i've could read that my self which really it does not state if they're compatible or not) even though the Headset is brand new (got it from TB website) just 2 weeks older than the adapter that i just got today 11/1/17 (bought @ Amazon-better deal & no shipping where TB wants to charge u $20 for shipping (in order under $50) in top of the price of the adapter)., so if this is all TB got to offer maybe i should look into buying Astro Headset & give them a try at this point bc i'm not expending another $$ on TB accessories if they only improve functionality by decreasing sound quality.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turtle-Beach-Ear-Force-Headset-Audio-Controller-Plus-Superhuman-Hearing-Xbox-One/dp/B00PWRYKDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turtle Beach - Ear Force Headset Audio Controller Plus - Superhuman Hearing - Xbox One</a>",1509494400,3

2058,562,1391,"This was an okay edition of the game. To be honest I didn't play very much of the Infinite Warfare just because I did not like it at all. I only really played COD 4 remastered which I still to this day play. COD remastered looks awesome and still has that classic feel to it. I can still pop that game in and play it for hours without really paying attention to the time with my buddies.

Infinite Warfare on the other hand is your regular run and gun type of COD game. Not a huge fan of it due to all of the unrealistic futuristic gunplay and how you actually play the game. Had I waited and known, I would have just got COD 4 remastered when it came out.

Overall I give the game 5 out of 10. Basically 5 out of 5 for COD 4 remastered. The other version of the game is garbage in my view.",1509580800,3
2059,562,493,"Uncharted 4 is a great game within a great series. Great gameplay, great looking, great acting. The story of Nathan Drake takes a few twists and turns. Some that this veteran gamer did not expect to happen. The game overall looks stunning. I don't think it can look better then this. This game takes you through a various amount of areas of the world and as expected Naughty Dog does an amazing job of showing that on the screen of how amazing they can make it look. The story is solid and keeps you drawn in throughout the entire time you are playing. I personally have played through the game three times now. It is like watching one of your favorite movies over and over you just never get bored with it.

The sounds within the voice acting, the graphics, and the gameplay all are home runs with this game. Getting the collectors edition you get an awesome statue as well as some concept art and the sound track. It all comes in a cool unique case which makes it fun to display for all of your friends. You also get some in game content as well which is also a home run in my opinion. The multiplayer makes a come back which is also hours of fun no matter what style of multiplayer you enjoy playing. Survival myself and me and my buddies can play for hours.

I can't say enough just how awesome this game is to play. If you haven't picked this up yet, do yourself a favor. Grab Uncharted the Nathan Drake collections and then this. Take a week away from work and school and just truck through them all. From the funny comments, to the easy to use game play to the stunning graphics. You won't be disappointed.

2069,562,1395,"This is my first review in a long time. Hopefully this helps any and all wishing to purchase this version of the game or the game in general.

I have always been a Fallout fan starting with Fallout 3 back in the day with my X-box 360. Then I obviously played Fallout New Vegas and now Fallout 4. I have to say, the jump to the next gen consoles went very well for this specific game. It isn't as glitchy as I remember the older games to be. The game looks very good given the type of game it is. For the type of game it is I never really held the game designers too much of a high standard due to the type of game and world they are trying to convey. For example, if you are buying this game expecting graphics like you would see in lets say, Grand Theft Auto. You aren't going to get that due to the world this is trying to depict.

You start off as the wanderer of the wasteland, much like every other fallout game you are by yourself sifting through a vast land of fallout nuclear waste. I for one enjoyed the main story line as it sucked me in and it kept me with it until the very end. It took me a while to get around to playing Fallout as I was finishing some other video games as well. However, when I finally got on board and started playing, much like other Fallout games I was unable to put it down for longer then a day as I really wanted to see what happened next. The main story is awesome; it really pulls you in and keeps you busy until you have completed it. Once this is complete there are still numerous side quests that you can complete as well as going back to older settlements that you've already cleared to help them out when under attack. I have to admit sometimes that gets a little annoying but fun nevertheless.

This version of the game comes with a cool pip-boy as well as a steelebook of the game. Some cool notes as well which I enjoy. Fallout and Assassins Creed are really the only games I pay the extra money for when it comes to collectors editions because you seem to get the best bang for your buck with these versions.

I don't want to go into to much just in case you haven't actually played the game yet. I DID NOT download or play any of the DLC so this review is based off of the regular stand alone game. However, if you are in the market to pick up the game and don't want to purchase the Pip-Boy edition the G.O.T.Y version is the way to go. You get everything the regular game has to offer alone with all of the additional DLC.

Overall I give them game a 7.5 out of 10. The game itself is awesome; the graphics are good but still look a little like New Vegas and Fallout 3 to me. The music is great and commentary is awesome. The main story is fun to play along too, the side quests are fun as well but they do tend to get a little annoying as well.

Hope you enjoyed the review and it helped you out! Now, get back out there and explore the wasteland!!!",1509580800,5

2075,562,65,"Uncharted is a game series that is loved by all. At least that is what I want to believe. Uncharted the Nathan Drake Collection is amazing in itself. It is the first three games that were originally released on PS3. They have been revamped with the overhaul treatment for your PS4. They look, play, and sound amazing. With any and all projects like this it is always important to ensure that everything looks and plays smooth and brings back memories of the old games.

This series of games does live up to the hype and is a staple in any gamers library of games. If you haven't played these games before or maybe you are looking for something new and exciting this is the way to go. The voice acting is by far the best you will find in any game that is out there. There is just a sense of realism with these games that when they talk I feel it is how I would react and act in these situations. The gameplay it self is easy to get used to and easy to pick up.

I loved these games when they were released on the PS3 and they are even better on the next gen system of the PS4. Do yourself a favor and grab this game. You will not be let down in any way

Yes its not like the other ones yes it doesnt have alot of cars. But thats how it was designed, and these people giving a bad review for a game they didn't research is their own fault. The game for what it was designed to be is fantastic, you cannot judge a game for what it wasn't designed to be. Thats like buying a beetle and getting mad because it couldn't outrun a Ferrari 599 evo.  This is a wonderful game for what it was designed to be official partnership with the FIA and you could find yourself in Italy at the end of 2018 claiming a trophy if you work hard. Its the closest thing to iracing anyone in console will get to. If you like the single player experience and don't care for online yes this isn't for you. But if you want to compete and like class racing this is amazing. People say forza 7 is better but you cannot compare the two they are completely different games serving different purposes. With all that said please know what you're getting. Those reviews are from people throwing tantrums rather than judging a game for what it was meant to be from the get go.",1509667200,5
2114,570,868,"Pros:
--Primary hub of Prague is quite detailed and fun to explore
--Many different weapons and aug choices to suit all playstyles
--Hard to pinpoint but something about the atmosphere of this entry in the series feels a lot like the original Deus Ex on PC (2000)
--The environment allows for some fun and sensible outcomes.  Coax someone into shooting at you within range of the police, for example, and police will respond to the threat and take him out.  You can enter most apartments but police will be aggressive if they see you breaking in.
--Exploration is rewarded (perhaps a bit too much)

Cons:
--Even on the hardest difficultly, DX:MD is just so damn easy.  AI behavior is extremely simplistic and the ""distract by throwing a trash bin"" tactic is sadly just about all you need to succeed on a stealth play through.
--Similar to the above, resources are way too plentiful.  Half hour into the game your inventory will be maxed out with Granades, ammo, health packs and energy cells.  You never have to worry about conserving resources.
--Praxis points are far too easy to obtain.  I had pretty much every aug I wanted By the time I was 25% through the main story.  You never have to commit to a play style because you easily earn enough exp to unlock augs for every style.
--While there ARE multiple ways to reach each objective, almost every time one of these ways is through a painfully obvious, cartoonishly large air vent that conveniently circumvents security for an area.  This seems lazy to me but it is reminiscient of the original Deus Ex so hard to fault the devs too much.

2119,44,185,"This review is for the PS4 version.

After initially completing the Ezio Collection, I was hooked on the series and recently purchased Black Flag along with some of the other AC series.  I probably should not have played and completed Syndicate though prior to playing this one as I have gotten use to the smooth character movement and (even though some people didn't like it) the grapple hook that Syndicate has.

Like the Ezio collection, the controls for Black Flag are awkward to me as I tend to grab and jump onto/off something when I really didn't intend to do that.  For me, jumping and climbing is really difficult at times and find that I really miss the smoothness and ease of jumping and climbing that Syndicate has.  Granted this game came out before Syndicate, so I am willing to cut it a bit of slack with that but it is nevertheless frustrating at times.

As it is with the AC games, there is plenty to do with side quests and the collecting of things.  It is interesting to explore the varies areas around the islands.  There is a variety of different quests to do throughout but are pretty similar to what has been done before in the previous games so it does lack a bit in original game play.  I do think the ship and ship battles are an interesting new element to the game.

The collecting of the animus items and songs gets a bit repetitive and is probably my least favorite part of the game.  The songs are a bit of a pain to chase down, although you can pretty much stay where the chase starts to get it fairly easily when it returns.  At least the collectable items aren't as hard to find as the glitches in Syndicate.

The Island scenery is well done and detailed considering the game is 4 yrs old now and considering I am comparing it to Syndicate.  The water is especially detailed and nicely done.  The basic gameplay is pretty much the same as Ezio games.  I do like Syndicates fight controls a bit better as it was easier and worked a bit more smoothly.  I do think that this games missions are more challenging here in Black Flag than Syndicate though as I thought Syndicate's missions were pretty easy to complete.

I am not big fan of multiplayer but this does have an ok MP feature.

I have enjoyed playing the game though, but like with all the AC games, I do have some complaints.  As with the previous AC games, there is still issues with glitchy camera views at times that make it hard to see and do things, such as the scenery blocking your view in the middle of a fight as well as some random game crashes.  A minor gripe is that you cannot put the PS4 in rest mode without quitting the game.  The game button interaction is a bit finicky at times as well.  As with most Ubi games, I am also not a fan of the microtransactions to get extra stuff concept but luckily you can avoid that and still build your character without paying extra to do so.  I do think there is a lot of the sameness in the missions as previous games though and that is a bit of a bummer. I am not so crazy about the Animus office scenes and collecting of notes as it is a bit boring and seems a bit unnecessary to the game. I also think the game menus could be a little less clunky but that could be because I got use to the way Syndicates menus were done.

The story is pretty good though with a likeable character.  The ship battles are a neat addition, but I do think the ship controls are a bit clunky and make the battles a bit harder to manipulate than they should be.  There are plenty of things to keep you busy, although the missions can get a bit repetitive.

I am coming late to this game and got it for less than 20 bucks, but I still find it is fun enough and worth playing, especially if you are a fan of the series.

2134,574,537,"One of the best game for the Wii! Using the remote to aim makes this game much more interesting. My one complaint is the same one I have for a lot of Wii games, which is that the graphics leave something to be desired. However, this is still a fun game to pick up if you haven't already played it on another system.",1509753600,5
2135,575,834,"Not including the Horizon games, this is the best Forza game so far, especially compared to Forza 6 and 7. There are a ton of cars, the graphics are awesome, even for the 360, and you are free to buy any vehicle you want. Of course it takes money to buy them, but it's easy to earn money in this game and once you use a certain manufacture long enough, you get free upgrades for that manufacture. You can do the ""world tour"" racing mode where they take you to different countries and you choose which class of car you want to race with. Or you can pull up the entire list of races in every class and can choose which one you want to do. You just have to make sure you have the right car for that event, but again, the cars are easy to get. BEST FORZA GAME CREATED SO FAR. Again, apart from the Horizon games...",1509753600,5
2136,575,403,"There are many things about this game that are awesome. There also many things about this game that make it very annoying. One of which is that it freezes constantly. I just barely got a brand new Xbox one s, and the game still freezes! Poorly made.
Pros:
- Enormous amount of vehicles to choose from.
- Great graphics
- Giant map
- Fun overall game

Cons:
- Difficult to earn money. Buying the VIP pass with real money helps, but it still takes forever to save up for some cars. Not including wheelspins, you earn no more than $20k in most races, and most of the top cars in the game are around 2 mil or more.
- Wheel spins are a good idea, but more often than any other amount you get $10k and under.
- Cars always pop up right on a turns blind spot, which makes you crash often.
- Almost all of the AWD cars are terrible at handling on and off the roads.
- Most cars that aren't AWD have bad acceleration.
- If any cars hit you, you lose all of your skill points.
- Other cars will randomly drive down the wrong side of the road and crash into you.
- Off roading is mostly a complete joke. You are constantly over correcting and just fighting to keep your car straight, while the AI drives perfectly.
- Has glitches that allow people do go insane speeds in garbage cars, which makes it unenjoyable to try and climb the leaderboards driving the normal way.
- While graphics are incredible, the graphics on the vinyls you can use are blocky and pixelated.

I would give this game 5 out of 5, but it almost feels like some parts are unfinished or untested. Otherwise they wouldn't be a part of the game.",1509753600,3

I couldn't find a single track or race on this thing. So I'm not entirely sure what the point is other than go through and get all the licensees for races that you'll never race on tracks that aren't here....at least not that I have been able to find on the game. I don't play with others on the internet. I prefer the AI competitors I am used to that are no longer there that I can find. If you like the MMORPG stuff with a bunch of 10 year olds running you off the track in every race then this will be for you. If not this looks like the end of gran turismo series.",1509753600,1

2178,586,82,"Saints Row 4 is a perfect example of a fan service game but yet knows to add enough to make it feel like its own product.

I prefer the crazy out-look that Saints Row has gained ever since the more wacky sides of Saints Row 3. So when the fourth title was announced I was excited to find out that it involved aliens and even a part of being the president. The story really tells the last adventure for the time being of the boss from the last 3 games and in a way brings it to an end with style.

The music was all over the place at times I found it hilarious and fit the mood. At other times it felt out of place while the radio music just goes to waste since you won't be spending much time in the cars.

The game looks just like saints row 3, not really adding anything new other than the way the city is formed but other than that it's still the same engine, the same world which does look really well produced on the ps4.

There isn't much to do after completing the game other than collect these fragments left around town unlocking more abilities or just to complete the collection.

Fast and powerful. Throughout the whole game, you will have this insane power inside of you, at times you will be tempted to go full power but if you do then the game feels cheap and that you're way overpowered. there are several abilities in this game ranging from running very fast to gliding across town or even super strength. In many ways, this is the flash game of the dc universe, which means cars go to waste and are actually a hindrance to finishing the game slowing you down which is a shame since it looks like whoever developed that section ended up going to waste,

The worst part of this game that actually brought it down a star is the expansion pack its one of the worst I've played in years. Its a joy to play as Kinzie or gat but its a damn shame about the plot and even the musical numbers. Even the gameplay feels off.

Saints Row 4 is a fun game with many things to love about it but has its flaws. No new additions to the graphics or world and ignores the car development section with its super speed powers from the start of the game. The worst offender is the DLC which I wouldn't recommend but does bring an interesting idea with its ending ill leave it at that if you wanna play through it.",1509840000,3

2219,319,478,"In 2018, this is still one of the best gaming mice you can buy. It has amazing build quality, an amazing sensor, and amazing buttons.

Going over the design, its a right handed mouse that is trying to be like the classic MX518 with a twist, and it does a good job at that. Depending on your hand size, it works with any grip style. It has that ""gamery"" look while at the same time looks professional and minimalistic.  Not many companies can make a product like that. Design gets an A+.

Now for features, this mouse packs a punch. Here are the features you get with this mouse:

Well tension-ed button, easy to click but not too easy to click accidentally.  RGB lighting, you can change the color of the Logitech Logo and DPI lighting, unfortunately these are only single zone, so if you change the color of the logo, you also change the color of the DPI lighting.

Pixart PMW3366 Sensor, this sensor was introduced in 2014 with the Proteus Core, and is still one of the best sensors on the market to this day. It can track pixel to pixel movements, it also won't lose track at ANY DPI level, and it can track up to 12,000 DPI.

Weight tuning, this mouse is around 120 grams without any of the weights, so it is rather heavy, while some will appreciate a heavy mouse this may be a deal breaker for others.

Free spinning scroll wheel, this mouse has a wheel like some of the performance mice. Push a button and you unlock free scroll, which is great for navigating long documents or just having fun, haha. It also tilts left and right, which can be re-programmed.

There's many more features with this mouse as well, it sure packs a punch!

The lighting is very minimal. You can change the color of the Logitech Logo and the DPI lighting, with 16.8 million color options to choose from. Unfortunately, these lights are under 1 zone, so you everything has to be the same color. However, this isn't much of an issue considering the lighting is already very minimal, which isn't a bad thing. You do also have 3 lighting effects: Breating, Fixed Color or Color Cycle. Overall, lighting gets an A+.

Now, lets talk about the sensor. The sensor is the PMW3366, which is a modified 3360. And this is arguably one of the best sensors on the market. It doesn't lose track when you flick it as fast as you can, at any DPI level. It tracks pixel to pixel movements at high and low DPI, and is capable of tracking at 12,000 DPI. If you have sensor issues, you either need to calibrate your mouse pad or your product is defective. Sensor gets an A+.

Now, the software. This mouse is powered by the Logitech Gaming Software. The UI is friendly and the program is very stable, its like Synapse 2.0 and Corsair CUE came together. In the software you can program the buttons, change profiles, change the lighting and much much more! You can also sync the lighting with other Logitech RGB products, which is a nice touch. The best part is, once you have setup your mouse the way you want it, you can uninstall the software because this mouse has onboard memory to keep your settings!

This mouse isn't just good for gaming, its great for productivity. I really enjoy using this mouse for things like media creation and general productivity. Its ergonomic, it tracks amazing, and it overall just works.

Would I recommend this? Absolutely! The weight might be a let down for some, but if you don't care about the weight,  this mouse is amazing!",1509840000,5

2262,599,1495,"I expected the graphics in this game to be a bit cheesy and they are, so that was no real surprise. The game itself isn't bad. What the characters say is funny, the different modes allow you to have fun in different ways and two player mode is crazy, where you can steal passengers fro the other players. Still, I don't love the main one player mode because it feels too individual and not like you are really accomplishing anything since you have to choose a new character and car again after the end of every one. It won't keep you busy for weeks at a tie, but it is okay to goof off with when you don't want to get involved with something that takes more time and effort. Cute, but not much more than that.",1510012800,3
2263,599,1186,"As far as games go, this is a decent racing game. There is a good selection of cars to choose from and some interesting tracks. I didn't love all the interruptions that the story causes in the beginning that keep you from getting to the actual racing and the way the world map works in this game is kind of annoying at times. You spend a lot of time driving from one location to another and back to the garage. The graphics aren't bad and the races are interesting and varied with drag, drift, circuit and other things to do. Not the best of the need for speed games IMO, but still fun.",1510012800,3

Yes, you have to gather things to build stuff and aid in your survival, but there are often times when there just isn't much to do. If trying to catch fish to keep yourself from starving to death isn't your thing, you might want to rethink this game.

2269,599,242,"This game is a lot of fun and is one of the better need for speed titles for ps2, in my opinion. I liked the different tracks and the cop chases in this game are a lot of fun. There are plenty of shortcuts to be taken on these tracks and the cops are determined to get you, so it is a challenge to get away from them, which makes it so much more interesting. The story isn't bad and the other characters don't interrupt you every five minutes, so you actually get to play more than just sit and wait. I liked it.",1510012800,4
2270,599,1499,"I bought two of these to go with our PS2 system and both of them had to be returned within less than two weeks because they stopped working. The first one refused to read the dongle and communicate after just a couple of days and the second one ended up with an electrical short and refused to work at all after ten days. It was sad, since otherwise they seemed well made, at least superficially, and the buttons and joysticks were great.

2294,188,1509,"I might as well start with the fighting, as it is something that all FF games still have in common: a crap ton of fighting necessary for leveling up and getting stronger to fight unbelievably difficult bosses.  Although this is the beginning of the end for strictly turn-based fighting, I actually allowed the game to grow on me.  Traditionally, FF games have been turn based.  You put in a command for each individual in your party and they act it out as their turn comes around.  Meanwhile, the enemies fight with the same system, having set actions already dictated for them by the game and then adhering by the turn-based system.  Well, not anymore.  Introducing: gambits.  Gambits are a set sequence of actions, dictated by a condition in battle, for each playable character in your party.  It's simply based on a ""if this, then that"" action.  If the party leader attacks something, you cast thundaga.  Or attack.  Or give it a high-five.  Or whatever your gambit dictates.  The high five is a joke, I hope you realize.  Either way, each characters has their own gambits pre-decided by you which basically takes your thumbs away from doing any hard work in battle if your gambits are set up properly.  I've sat around during battles, texting my friends because there's hardly a need to intervene once you have enough gambit slots and options.

Also, introducing, sort of, the License board.  Similar to FFX's sphere grid, only this looks like the periodic table of abilities.  Each character starts off in a different place, but it's a hell of a lot easier to gain abilities than in the sphere grid.  It takes only to about level 70 (which is completely unnecessary) to get all the licenses for all the characters.  A license allows a character to learn an ability, but you have to buy those abilities, and gambits, mind you, at shops.  And, get this, gil (money) is kind of hard to come by.  Stupid me saved every bit of loot from my battles for about three hours before realizing it's useless and I should sell it.  Voila! Gil!

As for the story, it's decent.  At first I was confused and bewildered as it is a highly political game as opposed to our traditional big-baddie who wants to destroy the world and our team is the only one's who can stop him/her/it.  This time, it's about sovereignty mixed with a sort-of-big-baddie.  But the politicalness of the story is tough to follow at first, and I found it hard to care.  Rabanastre, the main city from which everything else branches out from has come under the political rule of Archades, a highly militant city to the north.  Royalty have died or gone into hiding, and the original idea is to just overthrow these monarchs and reestablish free rule to Rabanastre.  You start off playing as an orphan, Vaan, who really doesn't become anything but a compatriot to the more important Lady Ashe, which is a nice change of pace, a female hero for FF games.  Vaan lives in Rabanstre, it's his home, and he's rightly bitter at the monarchs considering his brother, who was a soldier, died in the war as did his parents.  However, life seems pretty peachy in Rabanastre.  Freedom has been stolen, however, and it must be gotten back.  Okay, fine.  You can feel my indifference, I'm sure.  Thankfully, the story becomes a little bit more dire and urgent with the talk of more magical issues like manufacted (yes, I spelled it correctly) nethecite (may not have spelled that one correctly).

These stones, manufacted nethecite, magicite, somethingcite are powerful stones of magic that can bring about great destruction and ultimate power for those who wield it.  Obviously Archades has a lot of this power and a lot of these stones.  The plot thickens, thank goodness.  And so Vaan, his friend Penelo, Lady Ashe, a sky pirate named Baltheir, his counterpart bad-ass bunny partner and eye candy Fran, and a forlorn soldier Basch who was wrongfully imprisoned for years, but recovers quite quickly upon joining the party, must battle Archades and their power hungry appetite to free their homes and bring peace to the land.

Everything else basically remains the same.  There are summons (called espers) to be gained, and limit breaks called quickenings that are both based off of MP (magic point) amounts which, at first, I hated.  Once you're past level 30'ish and you get a few very nifty licenses, you'll be fine with it, most likely, as I was.  There are optional bosses, side quests that add to the story, and fun little games to play throughout the world.  My only qualm is you don't get a hold of ""free"" travel until fairly late in the game.  As these worlds are usually quite expansive, an airship or boat or something is usually provided after a few levels to help you get around.  There are things called Teleport Stones that are rare that help, but you can't go off and do a lot of side questing until much later in the game 'cause you'll use all of them up and have to hoof it everywhere.  Later, much, much, later you get a ship, but damn it takes forever.

A new idea introduced in the game replaces the card games and sports games of old.  Hunts.  Basically, you're a monster hunter.  You go after these monsters that are usually plaguing an area once you speak to the petitioner of the hunt, kill it, return to the petitioner and get some nifty rewards.  All well and good as these are some of the most challenging battles in the game.  Some of them are very hard to locate and are tied to, of course, other side quests, but are worth it.  Speaking of monsters!  The variety sucks in this game, unfortunately.  We just battled a big horse thing with spikes on its head, cool!! Five levels later... ohh look another horse thing but this guy doesn't have spikes but has the same body type... Ten levels later... another horse thing...bigger...great..but it's green this time.  It's like the game developers just replaced generalized body types and different colors for the monsters and called them new.  I guess it looks like it's a more traditional way of looking at evolution, since most creatures DO look the same in reality.  But come on, guys.  We're not in reality.  We're in a Final FANTASY game.  Make the creatures different, please!  At least for visualization's sake.

All in all, I liked it.  I'll stress the word ""like."" It took a while to grow on me, but I don't feel like I wasted 100 hours of my life on something lame and dreary.  It was decent.  And thankfully, the need to get to level 99 isn't pressing.  70, I mentioned earlier, was way more than adequate.",1510012800,4

2317,266,1521,"HUGE UPDATE FROM 5 STAR REVIEW.
Buying the Xbox one X Project Scorpio Edition, had to have been the most exciting part of my gamin life. Finally True 4K on a 75in X900E From Sony. Unboxed both system and tv. Wallah! The Xbox One X system couldn't run any game smoothly at all. I thought maybe tv, maybe internet, maybe system, God hope not!. Sent the system in for repair. All good on microsofts end and two weeks down the road, got my system, plugged it in, STILL SAME ISSUE!!!!! So I tried switching the tv. Next was LG oled E7P, then B7A, Then Q7F from Samsung. The Q7F seemed to be the best, but not the best performance of the system. So I sent my system back to amazon and went to order a new system. Oh goody the Xbox one X Project Scorpio Edition went up 125 more dollars. Screw it. I am going with the original system. Got it finally and guess what. SAME GOD UGH PROBLEM!!!!! Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for hyping up this console. It really pisses me off for the time, money, and everything to have a non working console for a second time in a row. Bought a PS4 pro today just to see how it preformed with the tv. Flawless. So Guess the system was the real problem here, and cannot for the life of me figure out how people are running this system so smoothly. Bare in mind I did all the settings. Look elsewhere and do not follow the 5/5 ratings.

How in the world did this get 5/5? I have a Xbox one x, PS4 pro, and Custom pc. Own all 3 Assassins Creed Origins on all systems. Have had to go through a Sony x900e, Lg oled B7A,E7P and multiple repairs for my one x. Could not for the love of me get this game to run smoothly. It is janky, jittery, and lags terribly. I have done all the updates, system reboots, tv everything and this game is a mess on my one x. I just got a PS4 pro and Samsung q7f today and the PS4 pro runs as smooth as butter. The pc version as well. But the Xbox doesnt want to cooperate. Expected better..... OLD REVIEW. The Xbox One X, Project Scorpio Edition, is a once in a lifetime beauty to behold. Hello Everyone, Welcome to Citrus County Reviews. XBOX Scorpio Edition has to have been the promise that was lived up to be. It delivers true 4k, her, and amazing quality to overall titles and future games to come. Upon unboxing I noticed a sort of heaftiness which is great due to it's a durable, premium console. The system did get hot at times, but not overbearing or extreme temperatures. I didn't notice any red rings or any sort of shutdown, but I had noticed a couple times when redeeming a code, the controller seemed to not register a letter, but this was a rare occurrence. The external look of the system is downright beautiful. Hard to say that with a black console, since that is the norm nowadays, but something about the glossy finish, the etched lettering of Project Scorpio, I feel just honored having this bestowed on my gaming display. One complaint is the internal storage capacity. 1TB is all you get here and strongly recommend an external 2TB all the way to 8TB from Seagate. I noticed the 1TB internal went away so fast after installing Assassins Creed, Shadow of War, Forza 7, and of course Call Of Duty WW2, I had like 92% Used space with 8% left. The 8TB though I have 7.9 TBS left. It is recommended if you have a lot of game digital and physical. Now for the 4K aspect. You need to go to your local Best Buy and find what TV best suites your eyes. Each person is different in how their eyes see pictures and movement speeds. I found 2 TVS that will match the XBOX one X perfectly. The Q7F from Samsung and if course, the high and mighty OLED55E7P, or OLED55B7A from LG. Qled technology is kind of old nowadays and doesn't suffer from burn in issues like the oleds. The only issue with qled is backlight, lag, and some picture issues. Oled however can and probably us the best way for you to go. Even if Microsoft partnered with Samsung for Qled, that doesn't make it the best TV for the Xbox one X. The LG models range in price with the E7P having an all glass screen and Dolby Atmos speakers built right in, to the B7A with a plastic screen and no Dolby Speaker. The input lag is 21ms which is outstanding for gaming. From what I have heard is that this has HDR10, but your gonna want to check on this. These do however have screen retention and your gonna want to be careful on choosing. No matter what you do end up choosing, you'll be happy with your choice after asking and studying up on it. Word of advice. Wait till January 2018, all 2017 models will have a huge price drop. Don't be like me who just buys a 4K TV on a whim. I went for a MU7000 by Samsung which is 4K, but lacks hdr10 support and other features. Game at times look absolutely incredible, but suffer due to lag city. Your gonna want to look for input lag, hdr10 and 4K support with about 10bit 60-50hz. If you want you can go up to 244hz as well. This is a system worth purchasing, but stay away from the mu7000 from Samsung. It's lag city. Here is a picture as well to show you what it is missing. Hope you enjoyed my honest review of the Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition.  This indeed was a promise kept from Microsoft, delivered it to many Long Waited Fans, and has proven to not disappoint. This is how gaming was meant to be.",1510099200,1

2340,602,1521,"I already own an Xbox One S but since I have a 4k TV I decided to purchase this to be able to take advantge of the 4k. I am a PC gamer and no other console got me excited like this one because now it allows me to play 4k games in my living room instead of in my computer room slouched over.

Pros:
-4k HDR console that is half the price of a high end gaming PC
-UI feels more snappy and responsive
- If the devs support it I can even do 1080p 60fps instead of 4k 30fps depending on the game.
- Small form factor

The only Con I can think of currently is the lack of console exclusives. Until recently I bought all my games on my original PS4 (not pro) but now I will be getting them on the X so I can enjoy 4k or 1080p 60fps if the devs allow it.",1510185600,5

Complete plug in to usb and to an xbox controller and switch it to x input and play any computer game and also map any button to rapid fire.  Works for all games I tried it on - rpg games, shooter games, hack and slash games.  Never attaches and reattaches on windows 10 and also never for my ps3 super slim, forgot to mention I tested it on that ps3 super slim too and it worked flawlessly too.  My first mayflash came with a bad button but I sent it back and got another one and it had no bad buttons so it was all good.  I love it, been using it for countless months now and will buy again if it ever stops working but so far it seems built to last like an original wired xbox controller because the it has a very thick and strong built in wired cable on the mayflash that looks as thick as that would and seems very strudy and would and maybe will last for 10+ years, who knows if I treat it well, haha.",1510185600,5
2350,159,1521,"Pros:
- Graphic powerhouse. It really delivers here. Edges are so smooth and textures clear. This is why this was built and it succeeds here.
- System remains pretty quiet despite the additional heat generated. A bit quieter than my PS4 Pro.
- simple yet beautiful design

Cons:
- included hard drive fills fast. I've installed 4 AAA titles and am at 30% filled. I really wish 2tb storage was standard for this model especially considering the 4k texture updates many games are getting. An external is in my future.
- Game installs take a very long time. I've heard this has been a continuous complaint for all Xbox Ones so I guess nothing's changed in that respect. Even with the ""install game then patch"" route, it's still much slower than PS4.

It would have been neat to have the Scorpio Editions individually numbered (as well as the controllers) or have something else come with it besides the stand to give it more of an exclusive feel. Just a thought, not a con.

This is my first Xbox One console and my cons appear applicable to any incarnation of Xbox One, not just the X. So for the new hardware I'd give it 5 stars. Overall, 4.5.",1510185600,5

2374,632,1549,"Do you like Star Wars?  Do you like video games?  Then get this game.

Despite being an avid gamer, I had never played an MMO before.  But Star Wars games draw me like no other, so I bit the bullet and got my first MMO.  I was not disappointed.  The reason for this is that while this is an MMO, you don't have to play it as one--it can be a pure RPG for a long time.  The core stories for the eight different character classes each take at least 100 hours of play and perhaps upwards of 200.  Now you are going to get diminishing returns after the first two or three play-throughs of different classes, but even for a single play-through alone this game is worth it as an RPG.  Character development, voice acting, setting (back during the time of Knights of the Old Republic games), and plot are all well thought out and well-done.  The cut scenes are pure Star Wars--grand and epic.  The gameplay itself is fun and, I felt, forgiving of a first time MMOer, while still having a number of more traditional RPG elements.  If you are interested in the MMO aspect as a first timer, it is fairly easy to figure out and you can usually find someone helpful who will explain things to you.  That said, my overall impression is that this doesn't have the strongest MMO community compared to some other games, but I don't have enough experience with MMOs to say for sure.

Truly, for the price, this is a great product.  Yes, there is a subscription fee, but for at least a few months to a year of game play it is worth it.

Do yourself a favor and go ahead and get this game; it's a ton of fun.",1510272000,5

2385,477,608,"I don't understand the low ratings for this game at all.  I have not played online in multiplayer, but I've played on local games and local multiplayer versus AI bots even on veteran difficulty and also playing squads.  One thing that's really important you have to adjust your TV settings. I had enemies blurred into the scenery, the game look washed out on my screen. After using one of those ""best picture calibrations tests"" to adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness, color, tint, etc and then going into the options and adjusting the game settings it was 20 times better.  The AI in other cod titles seems stupid and easy to beat in comparison to ghosts.

These are some of the smartest AI bots I've fought against in a game.  Playing Modern Warfare remastered while a great game your gun choices, perk choices and options are very limited. in ghosts you've got squad vs squad, you can make your own squad and personalize every detail about them (even a bot AI squad) and play against another bot AI squad or take them online and play against other players squads.  Don't play the game until you patch it, its so much better and you get the freefall map.  The MSBS assault rifle is a monster even with a silencer attached and the ARX-160 is so much fun to use. Seems to have almost no recoil its got the laser sight for hip firing.

As for the DLC? choose your DLC carefully, some is worth it, some is not. The standout dlc maps are Bayview, Fog,Ignition,Unearthed, Collision, Departed (for sure maybe even one of the best dlc maps) and subzero can be fun at times. As for worst maps? Goldrush takes the cake on that one. Behemoth is nothing special, and containment is just down right annoying. You have some awful default maps but also some really great ones.  Stormfront is an awesome map with a lot of players the more players the better that map gets.  Warhawk is always a really fun and enjoyable map to play, which I prefer squad vs squad on.

Stonehaven and Prisonbreak they could take out and I'd never miss them cause I never play those two maps.  Picking the right perks and the weapon that feels the best to you is how NOT to get killed.  Essential perks IMO ? Focus is an absolute must, I'd go with Scavenger so you don't run out of ammo, Hardline is great for getting a ton of kills with your killstreaks.  Incog is an underrated gem, especially playing versus the AI. If you don't want to be snuck up on then Amplify is a lifesaver. Keep in mind the AI bots hear everything even from across the map you'd think you were an elephant to them, so dead silence as well.  It's just too bad you can't turn off the dam music, if the could patch that? that would be fantastic.",1510272000,5

2401,635,1346,"Here's the deal. I wanted a barand new US version. If I am paying $299.89 and being ripped off hard, I at least want what I am paying for. The description is misleading. Here is the deal.

- Sold by: Golden Century Deals

- Amount: $299

- SINGAPORE/MALAYSIA system

- DOES NOT CONTAIN WALLPAPER CODES

- STICKERS COVER THE MALAYSIA REGION CIRCLE

- BOX NOT SHRINK WRAPPED OR MANUFACTURER STICKERED AND COULD EASILY CONTAIN USED SYSTEM

All in all, this is basically the same as a used system to me. I'm not apposed to this, it's just worthless to me as a collector. If I knew that this was not what I wanted I would have just moved along. And yes I know that this can play US games. As I said, the issue isn't me being able to use it. It's that it has questionable (at best) value to me as collector, and if all i wanted it for was to game on, I would have just purchased a used system.

AMAZON: You need to crack down on these sellers and their descriptions. This is clearly not what is advertised. I have had this for exactly 15 minutes and I already have my return shipping label in my email.

Lesson learned. IF YOU DO NOT PREORDER SOMETHING BRAND SPANKING NEW YOU MAY AS WELL WRITE IT OFF. Cause everything past the fact is not only going to be overpriced as all hell, it will be an inferior version (or a ripoff) of what you wanted.

AND FOR REVIEWERS: Please name the actual company you purchased from. Help us screen out the people scamming folks and stick with the ones who actually deliver what we pay for.

EDIT: Cooled off a bit and looked in the box. The box clearly shows it has been opened cause the manufacturers sticker seal is removed and left the telltale surface peel on box. Everything seems to be there and it's in good condition. Pretty much new. But with an already opened box this may as well be a used system so far as I am concerned. Worth $150 (scalpers markup) and no more. Anything over $200 is a straight up scam.",1510358400,1

That is every Star Trek nerds fantasy ( I'm more of a Next Generation fan though so having this game set in a timeline before that is a bit of a let down ).I mean if you want to feel like you're actually on a Star Trek Starship this is it. It is worth it to get it if you want the experience but don't expect any meaningful gameplay out of this.

Graphics: 10/10 top notch.

Sound: 8. The voice acting, weapons systems and sounds of the starship ( red alert ) are awesome. No music or soundtrack though or none that I remember.

Single Player:
They have tutorials that teach you different positions in a starship like tactical , engineer, captain , pilot and the controls are convincing. Now when I watch the show it makes sense what mysterious buttons they're pushing to do stuff. What each persons role really does. It's believable once you've been in the chair.

But beyond the superficial appearance you'll begin to see where the game is lacking. The missions boil down to investigating things by scanning them, rescue missions and fighting klingons. That's pretty much it. I mean come on game designers - come up with something more interesting like a story line where you try to solve some mysterious phenomenon by solving some puzzle or the ability to send away teams ( you don't actually have to be in them just do something where the ai will investigate and come back with something and you have options of what to do ) or maybe you are trying to negotiate a peace treaty between two species, or maybe you find a new species and depending on your actions they could become hostile etc.  and how about being able to hail the other ships come on! put more thought into it!!!!

Multiplayer:
Same problem as single player and more - the lack of interesting missions to do I mean beyond the gimmick of commanding and fooling around with starship buttons there really isn't much there. Also equally annoying is that I'll usually get a crew of people that just want to f around and fight Klingons. They don't actually want to act like a bridge crew or do anything they consider boring and there's really nothing you can do that will motivate them to do otherwise. People do what they feel and that's it the captain is actually useless and worthless position besides viewing objectives. Maybe it's okay to play with friends but out there in weirdo land I have yet to land a crew I enjoy playing with- they may be polite but usually they just do whatever the hell they want.

It's really so boring I stopped playing after a few times. I mean c'mon - how about adding true multiplayer where your ship vs another bridge crew??? How about being able to hail other ships and actual ability to interact with things in the universe??? Right now it's just a fancy interface with superficial appearance of progress. What you're really doing is working together to go to point A, do some mundane task, go to point B do some mundane task maybe encounter Klingons do some fighting.

2435,270,1573,"It's alright. Arcade shooter for what it is. I come from old school COD 1 where they made their big splash with the impressive dday campaign it was the best experience at the time and the series has gone downhill since.

To be honest I only bought this because it was the only game to offer couch coop with split screen and allow both to be playing multiplayer online so I could play with my gf here. That and zombies multiplayer mode was the deciding factor for me so that's why I got this; it was the latest version of COD and it had split screen multiplayer and zombie mode.

Single player:
It's alright, the campaign is pretty good the voice acting top notch and it's enjoyable as a single play through. Graphics and gameplay is good and it was at the right level of challenge for a casual player. But no replay value here.

Normal Multiplayer:
Super unbalanced for new players against players with all the best weapon and ability unlocks. I don't even bother after playing a few times because it's hopelessly frustrating, you just end up running around and dying and there is really no hope of earning a kill outside of luck. It's really the worst most unbalanced multiplayer shooter I've ever seen. Also unimpressive are the maps and game modes. Not sure why this series is such a blockbuster success. Battlefield one is way better and more balanced and the multiplayer battles are more epic and just overall much more impressive than this piece of crap.

Zombie mode:
There is technically about 5 maps to choose from and 1 offered without dlc, but I just got the game recently and I can't even unlock or download the other maps even if I wanted to, so it's just the one map of zombies we can play and that is bs. Imagine being able to play only one map in multiplayer what kind of lazy stupid game company does this??? You get bored quick because it's the same thing over and over and you become so familiar with the one map that it becomes boring. Granted it's a big big map with lots of areas to unlock that'll probably give you many many hours of game play, but still. ONE MAP?!?!???? Ridiculous.

Coop:
This game offers split screen coop and allows both of you ( I've only tried two players ) to both play multiplayer modes including zombies online or privately with only one player having ps plus membership ( if you want to play online ). That is actually the online thing this game has going for it. I haven't seen any other shooters that allows split screen multiplayer.

To summarize:
COD franchise is overrated , battlefield is much more impressive and enjoyable in this genre, but if you're looking for a decent single player campaign or local split screen coop , or a zombie shooting mode then it's probably worth it as there are no other alternatives for those features.",1510444800,3
2436,646,1574,Fast shipping ! Great game !,1510444800,5

2440,270,371,"If you get Battlefield 1 revolution don't buy it used, get it new because you need the redeem codes for dlc, and if they've been redeemed you might as well have just bought the used regular version and bought the expansions separately. There is no point in getting revolutions used.

Now my impressions:
Where to start? I'll say this: I've been a long time battlefield fan since the battlefield 1942 days and I'll tell you why - they are the only game franchise that has accomplished the ability the capture the epic scale of war into an enjoyable first person shooter. Period. No other game company has done this to my knowledge.

Amazing features in a multiplayer game:
To really appreciate what they've done you really have to acknowledge what this game features: 64 players fighting in epic scale well designed maps that are modeled after real battles in World War 1. The gameplay includes usable vehicles - tanks, ships, airships, airplanes, trains, motorcycles - mounted weapons - machine guns, flak guns, cannons, artillery - interactive terrain - destructible houses, towers, mills - you can hide inside them including bunkers, trenches. I mean, - you also get classic yet unique abilities with soldier classes like medic, scout, assault, support with actual roles to play in the game - they all play differently enough and has access to different weapons/equipment. No other game has this level of design and detail.

Single player:
Let's just say this: Battlefield has always been and always was at its heart a massive 64 player multiplayer shooter that favors massive battles over single player campaigns. Nobody really buys battlefield games for single player so if that's what you're looking for this is the wrong game for you as you really do need multiplayer to enjoy this game. With that said, this is my first time seeing a single player campaign in the Battlefield series and I have to say it's not bad at all. The story telling and voice acting is really interesting and it actually prompted me to learn more about WW1. The campaign can get a little repetitive and mundane but it was interesting enough that I never really got bored. You can probably get through the single player campaign in a few days if you play a few hours a day and it really serves as more of a tutorial to get players familiar with the game mechanics and different classes in the game.
  After completing the single player though it really made me appreciate the harshness of World War 1 and the people involved in it. It does try to get you to understand that War is tragic and not try to glorify the hero like in many of the other games. It tells you right off the bat that you are not expected to survive. It really does capture the gruesomeness of war unlike any other game I've played and it's a great thing to see that you don't play some glorified unlikely hero that can somehow kill hundreds of enemy soldiers like in other games. Well at least that's what the game tries to portray but there are typical scenarios where you're expected to wipe out crucial entities in encampments by yourself which can lead to killing entire encampments in one way or another. I think the campaign is great, not the best, but left an impression on me.

Multiplayer:
This is really the meat of the game. You go online and play 32vs32 in massive campaigns where your objective is to capture areas and push the enemy back. The game is well balanced and the game doesn't punish new players by overpowering experienced players that have weapons unlocked. Everyone has an equal chance at killing and you don't need to fight to really win, you just need to capture the objectives.

And this time around there are some interesting game modes besides the usual Conquest mode. I forget all the modes, but particularly interesting is the mode where both sides are just pushing through the middle in an all or nothing battle where you're either defender or attacker and you have limited troops so if too many soldiers die too many times before pushing through that leads to defeat. That is an awesome mode if you want to see big battles in a small area. There is also an operation mode that can be played for hours and what this mode does is it ties one battle to be next where you see how conquering one map leads to the next map in this grand scale nonstop campaign. It's basically the same gameplay but the different levels being that your next fight depends on your previous one and ultimately decides whether your campaign ended in success or defeat depending on the chain of events.

I will have to say though that one disappointment I had with multiplayer was that almost nobody uses voice chat and I was used to being able to type and chat on the pc in the old games - I still can't figure out how to change PS4 party chat back to public squad chat - where the hell is that option?? Now I'm permanently muted because I chose to join PS4 party. This makes you feel like you're on your own even though you are technically a part of a squad in some big battle and that really kills team work. Without teamwork it really diminishes the games true potential to be more strategic based.

Level design:
The maps are all great and well designed. They have choke point s where players are forced into big fights to take the next area. I like all the maps. They are all the right scale and size if you have enough players.

Summary:
This game really is great. I was a battlefield 1942 fan and even more of a fan of their modern war mod set in the gulf war era and was skeptical of how World War 1 would look in a game ( I don't typically like World War 1,2 settings and prefer modern settings ), but it was surprisingly well produced. I was hooked on this game for hours in multiplayer. No other game matches the scale of battlefield in first person shooters.",1510444800,5

2478,135,1037,"The Siberia 800 is my second premium wireless headset with the other being the Astro A50 Generation 3 model. For my review I will be comparing the Siberia to that headset. Comfort wise the A50s are .ore comfortable right out of the box as the Siberia 800s have more clamping pressure that require some break in time. Personally, I have a smaller head and the Siberias are perfectly fine with super comfortable ear pads. I can play for hours with zero discomfort. Sound wise, as many other reviews say the A50s are louder overall. The Siberias I have to use at 70% volume to equal 50% volume on the A50s. That being said I prefer the sound of the Siberias. The standard EQ settings aren't as good as Astros but I made a custom one that sounds incredible in my opinion. Having the swappable batteries means never having to stop and charge my headset again. Currently getting 15-20hrs per charge. The microphone quality is about the same for both headsets so I don't prefer one over the other. The only negative which doesn't bother me is that a chat cable is required for the Siberias to work. Doesn't bother me as I used A50 Generation 1 & 2 models before which both required a chat cable. I I highly recommend the Siberias if you want a great wireless headset.",1510531200,5

As per the typical, Trap Team and Imaginators damage levels are eschewed to push you to play the newer characters, but if playing Giants, Swap Force, or Super Chargers, he holds up well.

I got this to try playing FFXIV on keyboard and mouse, but I went straight back to gamepad. Still, it's a good mouse that feels good in the hand and the profile switch to adjust sensitivity is extremely useful, great for playing games with sniping/etc. Also, the third mouse button on the far right is pretty much impossible to use reliably, so don't bother.

I don't know what else to say... It works (starts up fine). If it has issues saving or anything else I will update this review. I'm just unhappy cause I bought it NEW in hopes of collecting it. What's the point of collecting a cheaper foreign variant? That's just my gripe though and it may not matter to you.

2582,497,1628,"If you missed out the first time around, don't be afraid to jump in now!!  Used figures are extremely cheap any more, and even if you want new ones, many of those can be found for about 60% or less of what they were going for originally.  Just double check to ensure it's one of the 80 characters that works with this game if it's the only one you have.  Any figure with a Blue, Orange, or Green bottom liner on the base with assuredly work with this game, assuming it isn't broken completely for whatever reason.

Swap Force is easily considered the best ""Playground"" in the entire Skylanders series.  With Swap Zone challenges, the longest levels in the series, the longest story in the series, PvP battles, PvE Arena mode, Time Challenges, Special Challenges, Great Boss Battles, a plethra of elemental gates, individual Skylander tasks (pretty sure on this one......may have been giants only), and a difficulty slider, most players of the series logged the most hours into this game even if they didn't count it as their favorite.

This is THE Skylanders game to get some play out of your entire collection without getting overly repetitive.  The entire story, All PvE Arena battles, and 25% of the swap zones will be available on the purchase of this game.  This offers a little above the average offering of content in most A list games these days.

In order to play EVERYTHING in the game (which is not necessary, but fun), you will need the following: 6 Swap Force figures w/ the other 6 specialties (digger, sneaker, spinner, speester etc.), a figure of the Earth, Air, Tech, Undead, and Magic Element (which can be taken care of by the 6 Swappers) a Giant of any element, and the Tower of Time and Sheep Wreck Island pieces (all these last 2 have to do is touch the portal once in your game file and you're good.  Borrow them for a second from a friend if they have them.)

The gimmick of ""Swapping"" your skylander's halves around is fun, but many folks enjoy the characters as they come.  The non-swappable Skylanders that premiered in this game are some of the best in the series and a blast to play.  You can't go wrong by just sticking to Skylanders with blue bases (and a single Giant of Course).

- Not the US version (but still works)
- Get it used (New is not worth the price IMO)
- If you want anything for collecting purposes, but it in person.

One thing I am learning from Amazon is that you can't be sure what you will get. Basically, You will most ;likely get a foreign version of whatever you are ordering. This is the Malaysian UAE etc version. Yes it will still play ( I just tested it) but I can't say whether it will save properly (it should).  Not sure how I feel about this.

You see, I am a bit of a collector and unfortunately I am starting late on collecting games and systems I knew I always wanted to keep. Some of these I'd like to remain new. Not sure how worth having this is if it's not even a US version. May as well have bought it used if I knew this was the deal.",1510790400,3

I constantly researched and tried for ways to fix the issue and came up with no solution. My Xbox was also purchased in 2015 so I already had a newer Xbox one controller with the 3.5mm jack built in so I thought that this wouldn't help. I decided to give this a shot and it was worth every penny. This is the best addition I've made to my headset which is over 5 years old because I didn't want to go out and buy a new expensive headset. My friends no longer hear themselves echo and my friends voices are even clearer. If you're unable to fix an echo or type of chat problem this may be the solution.",1510876800,5
2603,677,609,"My first introduction to the Fallout series was with 4 on the PS4, so i am a little late to the party. I grabbed this because I wanted to get some use out of my dusty PS3. The game LOOKS remarkable for being last gen title. There is obviously some stiffness in the NPCs during dialog sections, but nothing too horrible. The highly polished voice acting, gameplay, and narrative will carry this game through most of the blemishes.

The main quest is fine enough, but the real bread and butter of these games are the side quests. There was one in particular where you have to figure out what happened to Boone's wife when you get to Novac. Its a neat little mystery, and the culprit turned out to be the last person I expected. It was really well done.

There are factions and good/bad options to most decisions in this game. You may think you are making a good decision that should help the citizens of the town you are in, but somehow it backfires and someone gets pissed at you. You just never know what one decision can reveal. Very fun actually. Makes your presence in the game actually have an impact. You can be a total jerk and help no one or try and do the right thing.

The game is pretty impressive for being last gen, but there are definitely issues with it. Some that I have encountered myself, but thankfully I was spared of the more dreadful ones.

1. Lag. This one seems to be inescapable. You will get a small dips now and then just as part of usual gameplay. Every now and then the game will become a slideshow and drop to like 2 frames a second. I have never seen something so bad. For me it clears up after a second, but some people claim to have to hard reset their consoles to fix it.

2. Crashing or freezing. Another thing that is prevalent on other reviews here and game forums. The game will flat out refuse to move and you must power down, or it will just power down itself during gameplay. Have not experienced this, but it does come up a lot.

3. Corrupted saves. Also pops up a lot. The number one advice people give when playing these games is to have multiple save points in case one gets corrupted so you don't lose your progress. So far so good for me on this as well. May have just jinxed myself though.

All n all, this game is great when it works as intended. But when it starts getting nasty, it really does go right into the toilet. If I had paid full price for this game when it was released with these issues, I would have rated this a 1 star game. Heck, I probably would have been annoyed paying even  $20. In the end, I got this game for $5 practically brand new. Now there is a good price to give this game a whirl.",1510876800,3

2636,90,1655,"Rock Band 4, in my opinion didn't get the love it deserved when it was first launched in 2015. Whoever is at fault - either Mad Catz for the lack of production of peripherals at launch like Harmonix claims, or if it was Harmonix for the lack of promo to get sales up like Mad Catz claims, or if the genre just ran it's course from over saturation in the 2007 to 2011 stretch. You can claim who or whatever you want, but the truth is, Rock band 4 is a solid title, and still a fantastic party game for everyone!

I was able to get all my Rock Band 3 songs over to Rock Band 4, which to me surprise also included all the Rock Band 1 and 2 tracks. Apparently, if you have exported your Rock Band 1 and 3 track into Rock band three on your Xbox 360 in the past, they come along in the $15 export purchase for Rock Band 4. I was aware of this, as I ready it was to late to export Rock Band 1 and 2 into Rock Band 4, but that's only if you are trying to export them directly into 4. I already exported them into Rock Band 3 for my 360, so they all came over to 4 which was a pleasent surprise.

There is a $30 expansion to Rock Band 4 called 'Rivals' which adds online play and a couple of offline/local play options as well. There is some people complaining about paying the $30 for an add-on of online play, and although I can see where they are coming from, I am also willing to support Harmonix and purchase it. Harmonix is an independent company now, and they are some what on their own. PdP, who took over for Mad Catz when they went under helps out, but there is still licensing that they need to cover for music and to keep servers up and running, ect. So I purchased the expansion without any issues.

Game play wise, there is not much to talk about. If you are a fan of previous Rock Band titles, the core game play is exactly the same. They didn't go into a different direction like Guitar Hero Live did, so it is new, yet familiar game play. One of the things I absolutely love is the new peripherals. I have not used the PDP ones yet, but Mad Catz did a great job designing  the new instruments - for being plastic controllers of course.

The drums are pretty solid (wireless as well which is nice). The pads are more rubber type instead of Rock Band 1's original clacky and ridiculously loud pads, which makes them a LOT more quiet. They still make a little noise, but nothing more then a standard drum practice pad would.

The guitar itself has a very well done quiet strum bar. The buttons have nice clicks to them, and are nice in size, although if you are use to playing with older Guitar Hero controllers like I was, it will take a little getting use to, but not a deal breaker at all. One of the best features I think, is the audio and video sync option the controller has. I play through a surround sound system, and when the 4k tv and surround sound system both have volume, you can clearly hear latency. So what I do is, turn the TV all the down, turn the surround sound up, and then use the game's calibration tools. The guitar controller has built in Mic and video sensor, making it a breeze to calibrate the game to your sound system of choice. For audio, it makes a click sound and you just hold the guitar up to the speaker. Within seconds the audio is calibrated. You then do the same for video. You just hold the guitar up to the TV, start the video calibrator, and it flashes white on the screen to calibrate the video. The end result is a dead on accurate setup, making it easier to hit notes on the screen. I ended up manually calibrating the game at first, and I was missing notes and runs I was clearly hitting. But once I used the auto calibrator, it ran fantastic.

The add on DLC songs is where it is at, as the on disc sound track is not the strongest. I knew this going in, but I love a lot of the DLC they are offering on the store. Each song is $1.99 or there are special collection packs you can get.

Overall I love Rock Band 4. Some of the customization options for your characters are a little lack luster,and even the the Rivals expansion adds some more to  the collection, it's not as strong as previous installments of the game. But if you are into it for just the good 'ol fun game play, you can't beat it.

If you are a fan of the franchise, I would recommend Rock Band 4. Esecially if you plan on buying the Rock Band 3 export and the Rivals expansion. With the band bundles currently being about $170 here on Amazon, it is the cheapest it has been since it launched. I am enjoying the title very much.",1510963200,5

2641,632,716,"Fallout 3 is one of the greatest games of all time.

I know that last sentence seems over the top, but I don't give praise like that lightly, so take it as the true endorsement it is.  As a role-playing game Fallout 3 offers you a great deal of choice; who do you want to side with, what type of person is your character, how do you advance your abilities--all these and more are left to you.  The story writing is excellent and there is an incredible amount of attention give even in the minutiae.  You might find a remote home on the map with no connection to any quest or story in the game that still has a developed NPC (non-player character) who offers humor, sadness, or greater insight into the world of the game.  Another strength of this game is the open-world design.  While I am not always a fan of open-world games, this one, being set in Washington, DC, keeps things feeling fresh and interesting because of the richness of the locale.  DC has such a wealth of famous landmarks, government buildings, military bases, and subway tunnels that you really feel like you are in post-apocalyptic America.  The attention to detail with the Metro (subway) system in particular was downright eerie.  On top of all of this the gameplay itself was fun and satisfying; there is the usual assortment of weapons, armor, companions, and abilities to keep things interesting.

There are, of course, some flaws.  You will likely, at some point, find or do something that makes the game crash.  Likewise, as the game is now older, you may have to tweak it to make it work correctly.  But it will be completely worth it.

Overall this is a phenomenal game that you can easily, even with just playing the core stories, spend over a hundred hours playing.  The story, setting, and variety of characters, abilities, and weapons makes this a ton of fun.  Do yourself a favor and play Fallout 3.",1510963200,5

2651,632,139,"There's nothing wrong with this battery pack, it's just unnecessary.

The Xbox 360 wireless controllers are great, but being wireless, you are going to need a battery for them.  While are first glance it seems logical to get the battery pack built for the controller by Xbox itself, it is ultimately an unnecessary expense.  If you buy this battery pack then you also need to buy the special charging station for it.  This charging station can charge two battery packs at a time, but only the Xbox battery packs, it doesn't charge anything else.  You would be saving both time and money to instead invest in a set of normal AA rechargeable batteries and a normal battery charger which will not only charge faster, but also give you batteries that be be used in other electronic devices.

Aside from the fact that this just doesn't make sense to buy, there seems to be some quality control issues with these battery packs, especially the novelty colored ones.  Some worked great, but others held a charge poorly or drained too quickly.

In the end I would give these a hard pass and instead just use regular rechargeable batteries.",1511049600,2

2664,691,1669,"So yes it gets compared to the first Devil Mar Cry series because it's a Devil May Cry game...so that's gonna happen.
And rightly so.
Pros:
Combat great
Weapons are diverse and upgradable

Cons:
A little platforming?!?! It's half the game when it used to have no place in DMC
Cutscene - neverplayed DMC to watch a movie, just to kick demon ass - but these guys figured they had a blockbuster on their hands - fortunately you can skip them
Game way to short - so once all the platforming and cutscenes are removed, you are left with a shell of a DMC game  and little combat

Warning not related to this review.
Amazon have shortened their return policy from 90 days to 30 days.
I lost 600.00$ on an HP Laptop because of this.
I guess you need to verify the return policy everytime you buy on this website from now on, because it used to be 90 days.

1)The thumb buttons are orange and can not be changed, but that is not a big deal.

This game is a mess, the dialog is horrible (there was actually a line where leon says: ""what? You don't care for sewers?"" WTF? Who does like going into sewers?) This game is FULL of cheap deaths, scripted moves that don't work well (when the symbols come up to tell you what buttons to push) and generally poor level design (no exploration, no item or ammo management) you literally run through a pre determined path shooting zombies...that's it. The game plays alot like a on the rails shooter...and not a good one. Gave this game 1 star for graphics and the fact I paid 20 bones for it.

BE FOREWARNED!!  All the superchargers are weak in Imaginators due to terrible balancing when compared to the high damage output of the new characters.

At the now low price point, it is easy to pick up a copy of the game, the Sea racing pack, and the Sky racing pack for under $40 and have access to 95%+ of the content on offer.

This series didn't go well with some of the hardcore fans due to the deviation from the standard formula.  It also struggled due to burn out by the fans and an over bloated Toys to Life market.

They may have taken the Online racing feature down (unconfirmed as of time of posting) but same screen racing is still a blast.  The Water racing in particular is a great deviation from the stereotypical ""kart"" style racing.  All racing features the vehicles with ""rechargeable"" weapons equipped so you don't have to worry about ever being defenseless during the race, which is a nice change from the standard.",1511222400,5

I often find I can click on anything in windows because it is depressed. Also this happened while playing games as well. I am very careful with it and I am adjusting but I may go back to my Logitech Proteus mouse just because of the feel.

This is a highly accurate mouse for its price. GamDias is definitely deserving of praise on this mouse. Competitive and very useful. If you can master the right side button then this is better than or comparable to most mice even in the $20 to 25 range.",1511308800,3

2739,371,1525,"I bought this Sims 4 Get To Work expansion pack on Origin because I was able to get a good deal on it. I am not saying this expansion pack isn't worth the regular price of $40, but it's a lot of money for me to spend right now so I wait for a good sale to come around for The Sims 4 expansion packs before I buy them. I have really wanted this expansion pack for a while but I wasn't sure I would like everything about it particularly the idea of my Sims getting sick a lot and the fact that this expansion pack comes with aliens. So far, the illnesses and the aliens have not really affected my gameplay and I have played with it a few days now. I really like the idea of the detective career that comes with this expansion pack, but it is hard and a little discouraging at first because my Sims was given a tough first case and I couldn't find any clues, so the game said my Sim did a terrible job the first day. At least my Sims wasn't fired I guess. The doctor career started out much smoother for another one of my Sims that I tried it with. The doctor career is easier in my opinion, but maybe I am just better at being a doctor/healthcare provider. The detective career is fun and gets easier to do after a few days of doing it since your Sim will get promoted and you get different cases and assignments to do with it. I haven't tried out the Scientist career yet, but I wasn't excited about that one really since I am not a Science fan. I will eventually try it out probably since it is supposed to be fun to do. The retail businesses sound and look fun too, but I am more interested in trying out the actual careers right now so I will wait on trying those out. The retail businesses are flexible because you can sell anything in them as long as it's in buy mode or you make, as far as I understand it, which is nice. This expansion pack comes with a lot of new hairstyles, clothing, and accessories which is impressive and appealing to me also because I love getting new hairstyles, clothing, and accessories for my Sims to use. I also like that you can decide if you want to go to work with your Sims or if you want to let them go by themselves for the three new careers that come with this expansion pack. I would have liked it if this expansion pack came with a few more careers like the ghost hunter and education careers, but I understand that only so many careers can be included in it.  I would recommend this Sims 4 Get To Work expansion pack because it comes with lots of new objects/items and it adds a lot of new gameplay and career options.",1511395200,5

2758,27,323,"This game is TERRIBLE absolutely terrible. First the load times are ridiculous think Mass Effect 1 \ Dead Space 1 elevator ride load time LONG! In a next gen PS4 console the LONG Load times are terribly unforgivable. The long load times alone are worthy of a one star review! Just Cause 3 does earn its one star because; the explosions are MAD AWESOME, The fire mechanic is awesome too. Watching Just Cause 3 Oxygen tanks take off into the sky and blow up just never gets old for me.

However Just Cause 3 has more wrong with it than right. Example the world is empty as in devoid of life save a few goats. Weather changes rarely, there is no day night cycle to speak of like in the Far Cry series. The enemies are just wave generated garbage that spawn over and over again. The way points are white dots against light or white backgrounds making them often invisible and useless! Do I really have to tell video game developers about the importance of CONTRAST FOR WAYPOINTS! A small white way point set against a white back ground is USELESS! The invisible white waypoints would not be so bad if they did not have a timed mini game embedded that requires you to use the invisible way points to find equally invisible inaccessible monitor stations to liberate villages. I threw Just Cause 3 away after giving up on trying to use its invisible waypoints during the timed mini game. In every badly designed video game like Just Cause 3 you can always count on their being a really rotten ill conceived mini game that ruins the rest of the game play!

The car driving mechanic is sluggish and actually worse than what was done in Just Cause 2 PS3. The cars, trucks, helicopters and other vehicles themselves are greatly improved over Just Cause 2. The Just Cause 3 environment while dead and barren of wild life is extremely pretty. The Just Cause 3 Game mechanics are far more sloppy and unresponsive to input than those in Just Cause 2. Controlling the tether was next to impossible because the double tether and single pull tether were controlled by the same button never a good idea in a badly executed game like Just Cause 3.

Bad design decisions made Just Cause 3 timed monitor mini game extremely difficult to play. The dead environment made Just Cause 3 a very boring open world game. The wave generated enemies that spawned forever made the game a slog without a sense of accomplishment or purpose! The Just Cause 3 AI was pretty good in most instances. The long load screens were criminal as were the invisible wonky way points. So in summary Just Cause 3 was an EPIC FAIL! I'm lucky to have purchased this when it was in the bargain bin so not much money lost in throwing this badly designed garbage away!",1511481600,1

It seems to only cool my console by 3-5 C but this console gets pretty warm so thats better than nothing, but thats idle numbers when i play intensive fastpaced games like ""Sunset Overdrive"" it doesnt seem to get much hotter than it is at idle it only seems to go up in temp by maybe 10 C when compared to the idle temps with this cooler. I just wish it would cool my system better at idle as i pretty much just use my Xbox to run netflix and BlueDisc. Maybe add a manually adjustable fan in future Revisions.

Now for the noise, its pretty quiet tbh. I just have one issue after having it for a month i noticed a rattling noise that was driving me nuts so finally i lifted up the cooler and the noise stopped.

2817,725,386,"I was extremely disappointed. Loved the first game, the second was a masterpiece, and the third was just as fun as the others. This one...ugh, what a beautiful mess.
First off, it is the prettiest game I've ever played, by far. Combat and movement is smooth as silk; the characters' mannerisms are believable and the acting is spot-on, as usual. All that said, the story is unbelievably dull, especially when compared to the last ones. A half-hour in, I was trying to convince myself I wasn't bored and that the adventure would pick up soon enough. It did for one or two sequences, then it was back to the slog. In the third game, you escape a sinking cruise-ship, a crashing plane, and a collapsing lost city, among many other things; in this game...to be honest, I've already forgotten what happens.
With the success of The Last of Us, it makes some sense that the studio would want to make another Uncharted game that was even more cinematic than the previous ones. In order to do this, they sacrificed exciting gameplay for overdone ""realism."" Let me put it another way: if Uncharted 4 was an actual movie instead of a game, it would be a really dumb movie (much like the fourth Indiana Jones). I'm not going to spoil anything, but a significant number of plot points were utterly stupid. Sure, same for the other ones from time to time but, since they felt like proper video games, I suspended my disbelief easily. This, in its effort to be more realistic, didn't feel like a game and didn't feel like a good movie. I will gladly forget it in time.",1511740800,2

1. Terrible voice acting.
2. Inconsistent frame rate drops even after patch.
3. You get lost in foliage. Foliage does not adjust to players visibility.
4. You cant adjust camera closeness when traversing land... BUT!, you can adjust camera when fighting, what the...
5. Is this an adult game? Some of the skimpy girl outfits were really unnecessary.
6. The main character looks sickly skinny. And why is his hip off to the side?
7. Loading is very long.
8. Enemies attack like imbeciles. They gather up without considering their space or environment and launch at you mercilessly.
9. You cant hear characters voice in camp cutscenes when having conversations, but you can hear all other sound effects, their foot steps, objects they are handling etc. its a really cringy and weird feel.
10. The car is pretty much on rails.
11. Animations suck when jumping. Its like they're 10 frames or something.

However...Uncharted 4 just had too much cutscenes, too much climbing, and not enough gun fights. I don't remember it being this way in past iterations. I remember an even balance. Or maybe a little less in the cutscenes.

I think if uncharted wanted to add so many cutscenes they should of cut back on the climbing a little.

I did have a good experience playing the game, theres just no replay value for me. Whats the point of climbing so much?

2864,410,1745,"Bought this item on Black Friday i received the item on the 27 very excited to try and enjoy, i open the box set up the whole thing with the pc first so i could update/upgrade firmware then i when and set up with  my Xbox One S everything was working fine while i was playing by myself on COD WWII.
Then friends got online, i played with them for about an hour and the nightmare started i was on the Xbox live party some of my friends were playing GTA V and i was playing with another friend Infinity Warfare Zombie and a loud static noise happen really annoying so i thought it was one of my friends mic doing that but to my surprise it wasn't it was me ridiculous right! out of the box didn't even get to play much and this thing is already broken!!, or and there not really easy on your ears wanted to point that out.
I contacted Astro Support via email lest see how long it takes for a reply i give them 3 days if i don't get an answer this things are going bac for full refund. I try all the troubleshooting on the support site and apparently is the Mixamp the one with the issue.
In 3 days time i be in market for a new set but this time i will research a bit longer before i go and buy anything with a hefty price tag that breaks after a few hours of play time!

Update 12/4/17, Support from Astro was very slow to reply (4+ days) no phone # to call just email., they did not offer any help other than to upgrade firmware, after i did that a few times on my own their advice/request came after, so i was able to do multiple updates, and now the headset seems to be working fine no more static, so i was quick to judge the quality or the product bf checking all the facts and without enough troubleshooting in my part no thanks to Astro i might add, but everything okay now so i'm changing it to 4 stars, I will update again if something goes wrong but i will take all measures/troubleshooting bf i come back and complaint lol.

Update to my previous review (3/1/18), since my last review back in december 2018 i have had no problems with the headset everything is working fine, i been using them regularly as i played a lot online on my xbox one so far so good, i will update again in next few months.",1511827200,4

2867,312,1382,"Lovely headset for the price. Perfect sound, I actually like the 7.1 surround sound a lot for shooter games, though for others it seems to have strange effects (adds reverb and atmospheric effects seemingly). For PUBG though it is awesome. I also think it makes music FAR better too. It gives it a much fuller sound with greater depth. Much more enjoyable experience.

People on here have been complaining about the mic, but for me it works perfectly. It picks my voice up clear as a bell with perfect volume, and it doesn't pick up my extraordinarily loud mechanical keyboard whatsoever. I for one couldn't be happier with my purchase here, and I strongly recommend this headset to anyone.

It's certainly not soundproof, but it does provide nice insulation.",1511827200,5

2872,44,983,"This review is for the digital apex edition.

Includes the game and a bunch of add on stuff including Flame Fang Sabretooth Skin, Storm Cloud Owl Skin, Ash Back Mammoth Skin, Quick Path Gatherer, Quick Path Crafter, Wenja Hunter Paint, Legend of the Mammoth, Blood Shasti, Quick Path Warrior, and Quick Path Hunter.

I originally started playing the Far Cry Series after getting the Far Cry Collection that included Far Cry 2, 3 and Blood Dragon a couple years ago.  Although I found the collection and series a bit hit and miss to me as I thought Far Cry 2 was just ok but a bit frustrating because of its save quirks and being an older game, the gameplay was a bit dated and I felt Blood Dragon was a bit of a disappointment.  But I enjoyed playing both Far Cry 3 and 4 as they are both fun and action packed with good storylines.

So, I have been looking forward to something a bit different with the Far Cry Series and after the Primal Apex edition dropped to 16 bucks for black Friday, I grabbed it as I figured I couldn't go wrong at that price.

Primal has a different setting and look but has the familiar feel of FC3 and 4.  The biggest difference in gameplay is the ancient weapons versus the modern ones that were in FC3 and 4.  I personally found it a bit more challenging to use the prehistoric weapons than the previous FC games.  One small issue for me was how hard it was to see the aiming dot as it seems to blend into the background sometimes.  There are times when it seems that the enemies have an easier time spotting and hitting you than they should as well they sometimes also blend into the backgrounds.  Both are relatively minor issues for me though.

If you are familiar with the gameplay of the previous FC games, it is pretty easy to jump right into the game and get going without much difficulty at understanding the game.  Ubisoft tends to stick with what  works and although the game has a familiar feel the changes made give this game enough to feel different and fun.  With that said though, there is some repetitiveness with some of the collecting and side missions that the FC games tend to have that can be a bit annoying.

Like FC4, the graphics in this are beautifully done with gorgeous prehistoric landscapes with great audio to match.  The story is good, maybe not as good as the previous games, but I found it interesting enough to keep me invested in playing the game.  The animal taming is a pretty cool feature as well as the other abilities you can add via skill points.

If you like the previous games in the series, especially FC3 and 4, you will most likely like Primal, although I will say that if you prefer modern weapons and a variety of weapons, you may be a bit disappointed here.  I personally am enjoying the game and it will keep me busy enough until the next entry in the series.

2898,248,53,"Gameplay seems kind of bland and tedious. Level and character design is pretty good; but imo it isn't very fun to play. The mechanics just aren't very inviting. I also don't like that there's an ""always online"" game mechanic. If I wanted to play a multiplayer game, I'd buy one. Kinda sucks because I've heard a lot of talk about the dark souls* series, and the darker themes of the series seem interesting; though maybe it's only skin deep. I haven't played enough to know.

*I've read that demon souls is the predecessor to the dark souls series, and that gameplay and mechanics are pretty much the same, if refined, in the newer games.",1511913600,3
2899,248,229,"So I finally got around to playing GOW3. It's basically the same as previous games but better. The ""magic"" weapons/attacks aren't as useful or developed as in previous games, but the standard weapons are great. I'm not sure whether I'm disappointed that all of the weapons use basically the same attacks/combos; because while it seems like there's less variety, it's also pretty convenient. The plot is a little different than in previous games, but I enjoyed it.

The audio starts looping and the game slows/can crash at certain points in the game. I'm not sure if my copy or my ps3 are faulty, or if the game is like that for everyone; but that's the reason it's 4 stars and not 5.",1511913600,4

Later on, it does touch on some usual Resident Evil types of enemies. There's also a single person from the series that shows up at the very end...which doesn't look like the person usually looks like. Let's not get into that though.

This game is beautiful and gross. Intelligent and tedious all at the same time. Also, positively terrifying.

To put it simply, I love it.",1511913600,5

2928,747,1161,"I'll keep this short and sweet while feeding you the pros and cons.

Pros: good sound quality, high level comfort, easy to use, and comes with a built in microphone that can be unplugged to turn your headset into headphones.

Con: this one surprised me. The last thing I would suspect to be a flaw would be the volume rocker. Simply put, it sucks. It's cheaply made, and hardly works. My volume rocker refuses to change my volume. It only distorts or completely removed it. There is a way around it though. While very annoying and slightly time consuming, I found that pushing the rocker up a little past the max and fiddling with it from there usually fixes it. Since I got the hang of it and it only takes me a couple of seconds to fix each time, I only took off one star

Tl;Dr : great headset on a budget with volume rocker issues that are guaranteed to waste your time.",1511913600,4

- Exclusive Deals when subscribed
- A bunch of Freebies when available
- Enables you to stay updated on your DLC's (if you bought any)

3039,60,615,"Three stars for the following reasons:

Good:
- Wireless/wired
- Customized key bindings
- Ability to create profiles
- Active battery power monitoring with recharging cradle

Bad:
- Lacks nib on the 5 key to get a sense of finger position (-0.5)
- Overweight (-0.5)
- Right handed only (0.5)
- Overpriced (-0.5)

If you are a claw or palm position mouse holder, this one is probably a mixture of both. This because where your palm is going to rest depends on where you are going to position your thumb on the MMO keys. Unlike the Corsair Scimitar (which slides), the MMO buttons are locked in a fixed position.

Keymaps, its limited. Although you have up to 8 keymaps available, the physical button to keymap feature is flawed. Razer needs to let a button press cycle across the entire 8 keymaps instead of only going to one keymap. This forces you to use 8 buttons to get at each keymap (a waste). You are then forced to use Razer Synapse software to get to the right keymap.

Weight wise, this thing is a paper weight. They need a new design to reduce this by at least 20% with lighter materials. Realize this is not a normal mouse. It has stuff on it that makes it more heavier. This mouse is feels more heavier than my Corsair Scimitar Pro.

The biggest thing that I hate is that there is no nib sticking out on the 5 key. This is a critical mistake. All keyboards have nibs over the F and J keys for hand position. You need that nib to let you feel where the middle of the MMO grid is to avoid looking at the mouse.

In regards to lighting, its limited. You can't control each button color as all 12 buttons and the scroll wheel sync to the same color. Per button lighting can help you identify actions better by taking a quick glance at the grid. Staring at a grid full of the same color doesn't help at all - a useless feature. Use color to help in improving game play, that's what its for, not for aesthetics only. Also, there is no logo lighting - a missed brand opportunity.

For DPI sensitivity, this goes only up to 8200 DPI. Though most people don't use anything over 1600 for gaming, this is a minor issue but perhaps if you want to use it for desktop use at high settings across multi monitors, 8200 is all she goes.",1512172800,3

3051,762,539,Best trilogy ever.,1512259200,5
3052,60,1073,"3.5 stars for reasons below

I have the following mice to give a fair assessment of what I think of this Corsair Scimitar:
- Corsair Scimitar Pro
- Razer Naga Epic Chroma
- Logitech G600
- Zowie ZA12
- Logitech M510

Pros
- Lightweight
- Customized lighting in 4 zones
- Multi level DPI configuration levels w/on the fly switching
- Button grid that can be slid forward and back for better hand position
- Textured buttons with the 5 button with nib
- Braided cable

Cons
- Very much a palm mouse. If you claw, it may take a while to get used to
- My 4 button gets stuck at times spewing 4's across the screen. I have to wiggle it to make it stop. Very bad.
- Can only store 3 hardware profiles. This thing should be able to store a 100.
- Clicking the middle scroll wheel as a button is way too rigid. Imagine setting this to spacebar for jumping in a FPS. It too rough and should have more ""give"" to it.
- No lighting per button. Would be nice to distinguish rows for software purposes (i.e. editing, movement, building, fighting, etc.)
- Cue software UI sucks for setting up this mouse. As a new user, you are better off deleting all the Actions and starting from scratch to learn the UI.
- Top button next to mouse wheel is hard wired for profile switching. What if I wanted to use this for something else?
- Surface calibration feature doesn't work well. I get terrible lag when trying to drag and draw in a circular pattern that it makes me wonder if this is even calibrating right. This, at 1600 DPI setting on a Corsair XXL mat and fast Ryzen 1700X.

Improvements needed:
- Get rid of the metal plate. Its unnecessary baggage that adds to the weight of the mouse and cost. The lighter the better for less hand fatigue.
- Storing only 3 profiles is lame. Many of us play way more games and use many applications. Let us store at least 100 profiles by designing the mouse to use microSD to store the profiles on. When you click the profile button, it brings up a dialog box that lets us select which profile to use. You owe me Corsair for this idea.
- Cue software needs to not show panels that don't correlate to the present view. For example, why should the left panel of buttons that have nothing to do with the grid buttons be shown? Also don't show the G1-G10 panel when it has nothing to do with the present view. Stupid things like this clutter up the UI configuration and cause confusion. The lower panel also needs to be in sync with the present focus of the button.
- Way too long of a cable. I attach this to the back of my Corsair Strafe keyboard port and you won't believe how ugly this looks on the desk. Supply a short braided 3' cable and a 10' cable. I've also have too many USB connect/disconnect problems in this configuration.
- Ability to slide the grid back another 1/4"". People with small hands (even kids) have to go into claw mode instead of palm mode to get at these buttons. For example, I rest my palm on the mouse and my thumb is comfortably on the 5 key. The button grid is all the way slid back. However, when I need to reach for the 123 keys, I have to physically lift my hand off the mouse and reach for the 123. If I don't, I risk clicking on two keys (i.e. 1/4, 2/5, 3/6). This forces me to push my hand forward wasting valuable time, especially in FPS games.

One thing to consider that I noticed on all my MMO mouses is that if you have a need to lift the mouse off the mat, these devices are not ideal.  First, they are heavier than your typical gaming mouse like the Zowie EC. Over long play sessions, you develop hand fatigue. Second, you can accidentally click one of the buttons on the grid at an inopportune time, espeically while you are playing a fast FPS game. Lastly, finding a means to even grip onto something and lift is a problem - there's nothing to grab onto and feels way unstable. The design on this mouse is awkward. Along the right hand side there is a textured rubber grip region. But, my ring finger and pinky can't grip this and lift without feeling like I'm losing grip.

These types of mice are best suited for palm players with larger hands. More for your Warcraft, Dota, type of games rather than FPS.  If you are going to use this for FPS and play with low DPI and need to lift, good luck! More times than not I have felt that I lost the sense of grip and moved from palming, to clawing.",1512259200,3
3053,250,1798,"Great gaming mouse for the price. I personally prefer when the side buttons are a bit bigger but I knew what they were like before I got the mouse. For the price, you'd be hard pressed to find a better mouse",1512259200,5

This story is built primarily on the existing map, allowing you to visit previously inaccessible areas to the north and east as well as some greater exploration in Oxenfurt (the smaller city on an island to the east.) The game does a very nice job of developing a story that's significantly different than the base game with 3 or 4 quests. Without giving much of it away, there's a caper-like quest, a quest in which you explore a pretty surreal world, and one in which you engage in an extended period of social ridiculousness that seems very out of character for Garalt (but is fun none-the-less). Finally, as the game progresses, you'll gradually come to realize exactly who they've modeled the antagonist after which is an enjoyable little reveal.

Blood and Wine:
This DLC adds an entirely new area beautifully modeled after Tuscany. (or somewhere there-abouts). The story here is also well-developed with some equally well-developed and sometimes lengthy side-quests. Also added are new witcher abilities, a new level of witcher gear, additional monsters, the ability to take out entire encampments of dozens of bandits, your own estate that you can customize (to a degree), and other little surprises.

3098,782,256,"I used to have the old mayflash adapter for PC in 2012 which only supported two controllers and SOME rumble compatibility, and didn't work for Smash. This one is much nicer in almost every aspect, including shape/size, build quality, and compatibility.

I bought this with the intention of testing ""Nintendont"" (a home brew application that works on the Virtual Wii side of WiiU that can play NGC titles via USB/SD) as the software declares working with the Nintendo adapter for the most recent Smash title. This one has a switch that allows the change between WiiU and PC modes, which I assume means the old one needed hardware to work on the console, which it did not.

I first tried this at a friends house with a copy of smash. Worked fine, no lag as we could tell, and no input errors/ghosting. Cord length is also well above average. Smash fans, rejoice. A cheaper and just as good option exists!

Second, I tried it with the homebrew software ""Nintendont"", seeing if it worked on the virtual version. I nearly inserted my actual GameCube disc since I was excited by the clean results in smash, which would have been bad (no, GameCube discs will not work and may damage your WiiU. Please do NOT try that.) The menu immediately picked up the controller like it did in the original Wii. I booted up the ISO for Kirby Air Ride and was met with excellent results. No input lag or ghosting. Now for the real precision test, I used F-Zero GX, notorious for being very sensetive to stick input and is highly customizable for dead zones, sensitivity, range, etc. I mapped the stick to the fullest and smallest ranges/zones I could and they were pixel perfect as with the Wii disc reader, and the good old GameCube itself. I was convinced at that point at how well it works.

Final testing was done with Dolphin for Windows. I was met with the same results using the same titles as it was on the WiiU. Finally, quality rumble support! I didn't have to map anything in the version I used as it already had a preset for a real GameCube pad. However, if your version doesn't pick up the pad on its own, make sure you map the triggers separately from the analog sliders to the click button when you press it all the way down. Otherwise games like Metroid Prime will have issues when locking and free aiming. To do this, go to the controller properties in devices and printers and look at the red icons lighting up to see what numbers they are.

In the end, I have to hand it to the developers at Mayflash. Product quality is definitely increasing at excellent prices. 5/5, I really cannot knock it for anything.",1512345600,5

It's a really great feeling mouse, but I had to dock it one star because the scroll wheel tends to squeak. I often play games with friends and they've complained about the sound the scroll wheel makes through our voice chat.
Besides that, the macro buttons are comfortably placed for my hand and I like the size and feel of it overall.
The software is only needed to change setting on the mouse as once they're set they seem to stay saved on the mouse and are instantly usable on another computer.

3161,802,615,"Dec. 7th 2017
I probably wouldn't recommend this mouse. To save some people time, the main issue I have with this mouse is that after a month or two of use it stops tracking randomly at any time even in games and you either have to unplug it and plug it back in or wait 5-15 seconds for it to start working again. This appears to be an issue many people have had; I remember seeing reviews about it before I bought it and decided to take the risk. By comparison, I bought a Razer Deathadder Chroma on May 18, 2016 and haven't had any problems yet. My brother also bought a Deathadder Chroma on Oct. 20, 2016 and hasn't had problems yet. Although I love the Deathadder I think I'll be trying the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum to replace this Naga Hex V2 just to get some experience with another well known brand.
See below for a detailed comparison/review.

**This review will be mostly a comparison between the Razer Naga Hex V2 and the Razer Deathadder Chroma.**
I bought this mouse on July 12, 2017 on sale for $42.89 after tax and it looks like it's on sale for ~$45 now so this might be a good time to review it. I've been using it almost every day with my desktop PC for anywhere from 30 minutes to 6+ hours of constant movement and clicking. This includes simple tasks like spreadsheets, YouTube, Netflix etc. as well as more intense use like MOBA and FPS games. I bought it partially because it was on sale and partially because I needed a mouse for my laptop (I switched my Deathadder Chroma from my desktop to my laptop).
I'll start with the positives. This mouse looks great, and since I already had the software installed it was fairly quick to set up. It does of course have more options than the Deathadder, specifically in reference to the side buttons. The Deathadder is limited to 2 side buttons which I use to adjust DPI on the fly and I believe that's the default setting , but they can be changed. The Naga Hex V2 however puts these buttons behind the scroll wheel and adds an additional 7 side buttons that can be programmed to pretty much any combination of keys you can think of, I also like having a place to rest my thumb in the middle of the buttons. Both the Deathadder and the Naga Hex V2 allow you to change the colors.

Ok now for a few negatives (sort of). The first major difference I noticed when switching from the Deathadder to the Naga Hex V2 was that this mouse tends to promote more of a palm grip while the Deathadder seems to be better suited for a finger/claw grip. This made the Naga feel odd at first but I got used to it and it's perfectly comfortable even though my hands are fairly small for a guy; so in the end no issue there. The second problem I had was the organization of the 7 side buttons; looking at the side of the mouse directly, the keys go in order of 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5, 4 clockwise. Personally I found this made it harder to get used to the buttons but then again I've never been a big user of programmable mouse buttons so maybe more experienced users won't have a problem. Another thing I realized is that I prefer the DPI quick switching to be on the side for easier access so if you want that you'll have to program 2 of the side keys to do it. Oddly enough accidentally pressing the DPI buttons seems to happen to me the same amount regardless of whether I use the Naga or the Deathadder, but it's rare in both cases. These issues are negligible and I'd probably give this mouse 4 stars at the ~$80 or 5 stars at the ~$45 price if it wasn't for the tracking issue I mentioned at the start of this review.
Sorry for the long review, I hope this helped some people with their decision in buying a mouse.",1512604800,3

Long story short, I would definitely recommend this mouse to a friend. My original review of this mouse shortly after buying it was 3 stars because the software was giving me problems. After realizing it was an issue with my PC I changed the review to 4 stars. Now after 1 year and 7 months of continuous use with no issues, I feel obligated to give this mouse 5 stars and re-write my review.

**Durability** Putting this first because it's the big reason I chose to give this 5 stars.
I bought this mouse on May 18, 2016. Since then I've used it daily on both my desktop PC and my laptop. I've used it for browsing, streaming movies, social media, and playing MOBA, FPS, and MMO games. Daily use varied from a few minutes browsing one day to multiple hours of intense gaming another day. I haven't encountered a single issue with tracking or clicking in 19 months of use and on top of that, the USB cord shows no signs of damage. When I got the Razer Naga Hex V2 for my desktop about 5 months ago I started using the Deathadder for my laptop and it's seen a fair bit of travel in those 5 months. I just wind the cord around the mouse and place it in my laptop bag. I've even dropped it a few times. On the other hand, in those 5 months the new Naga Hex V2 has had a continuing problem with the tracking randomly turning off while I'm using it, and it hasn't ever left my desk. At this point I wish I'd just bought another Deathadder.

**Comfort**
I tend to use a finger grip with this mouse but it seems to me that any style grip would be comfortable. I've also seen many people say it's a good mouse for large hands but I personally have small hands and really enjoy the feel of this mouse. I can't recall feeling any discomfort while using this mouse for extended periods of time (3-6 hrs).

**My Experience**
I'm no expert but in my experience this is my favorite mouse for gaming so far. The tracking is fluid and with options ranging all the way up to 10,000 DPI I've really been able to experiment and find my personal preference. I'm not sure anyone uses a DPI near 10,000 though. Personally I find that 1800 suites me well in most cases; but I have presets for 800, 2000, 2450, and 3000 also. So far this is my favorite gaming mouse but honestly I haven't tried too many. Others I have tried include the Razer Naga Hex V2, the Gigabyte GM-M6900, and a few off-brands; none of which I would recommend. In a few days I'm replacing my Naga Hex V2 with a Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum which I have high hopes for. I considered getting another Deathadder Chroma but they were out of stock.",1512604800,5

I just wind the cord around the mouse and place it in my laptop bag. I've even dropped it a few times. On the other hand, in those 5 months the new Naga Hex V2 has had a continuing problem with the tracking randomly turning off while I'm using it, and it hasn't ever left my desk. At this point I wish I'd just bought another Deathadder.

**Comfort**
I tend to use a finger grip with this mouse but it seems to me that any style grip would be comfortable. I've also seen many people say it's a good mouse for large hands but I personally have small hands and really enjoy the feel of this mouse. I can't recall feeling any discomfort while using this mouse for extended periods of time (3-6 hrs).

**My Experience**
I'm no expert but in my experience this is my favorite mouse for gaming so far. The tracking is fluid and with options ranging all the way up to 10,000 DPI I've really been able to experiment and find my personal preference. I'm not sure anyone uses a DPI near 10,000 though. Personally I find that 1800 suites me well in most cases; but I have presets for 800, 2000, 2450, and 3000 also. So far this is my favorite gaming mouse but honestly I haven't tried too many. Others I have tried include the Razer Naga Hex V2, the Gigabyte GM-M6900, and a few off-brands; none of which I would recommend. In a few days I'm replacing my Naga Hex V2 with a Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum which I have high hopes for. I considered getting another Deathadder Chroma but they were out of stock.",1512604800,5

3198,188,549,"If I could give it a 4.5, I would, but alas, Amazon insists on keeping whole stars.  Regardless, this game truly blew it out of the water at the time.  I fondly look back on playing it in high school and remembering how people who never played games, mostly girls (as I, too, am female), started to get into gaming BECAUSE this game was dictated towards younger, less mature audiences.  And, hell, there's Disney characters in it!

The game itself is kind of genius.  To combine Squaresoft's popular Final Fantasy characters, new characters of their own such as Sora, Riku (a young Sephiroth look-alike), and Kairi, while ALSO blending in Disney characters seemed destined for failure, but it worked and worked well!  Us gamers were overjoyed to see familiar faces, while us Disney dorks jumped for joy upon revisiting our childhood favorites.

The story is centered around a Keyblade master.  The Keyblade has chose Sora, our main character, to wield the Keyblade and either save or destroy many worlds.  The problem is that some arch-nemesis has begun to let the Darkness and the Heartless seep out into the many worlds of the stars and destroy them.  Stars are winking out.  Whole worlds are disappearing.  Donald and Goofy, two of the more popular Disney characters of all time, join forces with Sora to not only seek out King Mickey, who is attempting to stop the Heartless, while Sora looks for his friends Riku and Kairi after their world disappears.  The company must travel from world to world to defeat the Heartless, and seal it with the Keyblade so that the world can be threatened no more.

Each world with the exception of Traverse Town, the first world Sora ends up in, and Destiny Islands, Sora's home world, are Disney worlds.  A main gripe is that some of the worlds aren't really what you're going to be expecting.  For example, Neverland is hardly Neverland.  It's literally Captain Hook's ship and the Clocktower, which, by the way, is in London...not Neverland.  The Coliseum, for Herclues' world is just that, a Coliseum, but I do like that there are tournaments you can take part of there so it's forgivable.  Understandably, the developers were doing something never done before with a huge blending of games and universes in order to create Kingdom Hearts, and so some of these worlds were not that developed.

Another gripe is that the controls can, at times, be annoying.  Jumping onto things is about as erratic as a seizure and many hours were spent overshooting or undershooting targets.  While battling, the controls to heal or cast magics can be infuriating as well since it takes a half of a second for an item or a spell to take effect and that can make all of the distance.  Why does Sora have to stand still to cast a spell?  I just don't get it.  BAM!! Sora's dead 'cause he stood still while some nasty boss came flying out of nowhere.

However, this all aside, the game is brilliant.  The abilities that are gained, the side-quests, the amount of time spent completing side quests and leveling up are all just so seamless and well thought-out.  Summons are a lot of fun, too, since they are Disney characters, too.  Though almost all of them are from worlds you don't visit.

The game is easily for all ages.  It can be a little hokey for grown adults who aren't into Final Fantasy and Disney, but for kids it's great and for anyone that's into those two categories they'll love to play this.

It's simply a story about not giving up and following your heart and believing in yourself while having fun along the way.  All good lessons for us to remember.",1512691200,4

3236,514,577,"One of the best zombie games I've ever played. Maybe even the best.
My first run through the campaign was honestly a nightmare. I thought the combat was clunky, and the zombies were too strong. This was on normal mode, and I had yet to get used to the dodging, grappling, and parkour mechanics. 80% of the campaign I spent spamming molotovs and firecrackers, just to get my skills leveled up. I felt like I was so weak most of the time. But my second run through, and this is on the hardest difficulty, ""Nightmare"" with all my skills from my first run...(I'm only on the 4th story mission I believe) It's soo much more fun. I can run/climb faster, outrun and conquer any horde of zombies, pick very hard locks in a group of them without getting hurt, and sneak insta-kill them at will. The fast zombies(Virals) are still quite the annoyance, but I can handle 3-4 at once, as oppose to getting killed by 1-2 on NORMAL. Great game, ending was kinda ""meh"", but i'd give i a 9.

2)  The reason why I am going to buy another is this.  While the Drive Hub lets me use a PS4 controller on my Xbox, it only does so Wired.  I want to use my PS4 controller over Wireless.  This will allow me to do that with the supplied Blue Tooth Dongle.",1513036800,5

Well I bought this game and one of the selling points was the ""visuals"", they must mean compared to the original release because the game is hideous (not in a cool, creepy way, I mean ugly). 1080p is wasted on this game. The graphics being bad wouldn't be to bad though (I'm old and remember when resident evil 1 was cutting edge) but the dialogue and story are REALLY bad. Then you get to the controls, OMFG. Talk about annoying, I've played other resident evil games made for 1 stick (mercanaries on 3ds for example) but after playing a bit you get a feel for it. This game isn't like that (for me atleast). IMO if Capcom wasn't going to put anymore into this port than they did they should have skipped it, even at 20 bones this game isn't worth the money. My advice is if you want a survival horror game for 20 for the ps4 I would get res 5 or 6. I'm not a big fan of the action resident evil games but they are WAY better than this game. If you have another 10 buck's  to drop and want real survival horror I would look at Resident Evil 7 or The Evil Within 2...both killer games.",1513036800,1

Obviously the series has progressed, but when anyone asks me where they should start when beginning this series, I always say Demons Souls. The last two friends I had talked into playing Demons Souls both Platinumd in it, as did I when I first played it, and went on to play and platinum the others. Demons Souls, DARK SOULS, DARK SOULS II, Bloodborne and DARK SOULS III are all perfect games, so you might as well start at the beginning!

3441,802,478,"I've only had this mouse for a few days so I'll be coming back to update this review if need be.
This is a great looking mouse, and the weight and construction feels like solid quality.  I bought it to replace my Razer Naga Hex V2 because the tracker on the Naga kept failing randomly after only a few months. So far it's great, the software is fairly straightforward and I like the button placement. The cord seems strong and durable and has plenty of length. I experimented a little and found that I prefer the natural weight of the mouse without any of the extra weights since I tend to pick my mouse up slightly quite often during games. The buttons can be programmed to pretty much anything but I'm so used to using keyboard commands that I have trouble remembering to use my mouse shortcuts sometimes, even after using the Naga with it's buttons. The mouse buttons themselves are nice and clicky but not too loud. The scroll wheel is different, I'm definitely used to a rubber wheel. It's nice that you can use free scroll for things like looking through a long document or lock the wheel for times when you need the distinct click (like when you are switching weapons in a game). The wheel takes a little getting used to but it started feeling normal to me after a few uses.

The only thing I dislike about the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum is that it feels very thin in comparison to the other mice I've tried (Razer Deathadder Chroma and Razer Naga Hex V2). It feels odd to say a mouse feels too small since I have small hands for a guy, being only 5'6"" tall. This may just be because I was so used to the Naga. It seems that Logitech intentionally slimmed down this mouse from older models; it looks nice but my ring and pinky finger have nowhere to rest. It felt weird at first but I've kind of gotten used to it, however I've noticed I tend to feel discomfort after extended use. The Razer Naga Hex V2 was a disappointment when it came to the tracking but I will say it had an excellent ergonomic design. Which is funny because when I first bought that mouse I thought the extra finger rest on the right side made it look weird but now I feel like the only thing missing from the G502 is that extra resting space. I decided to give it 5 stars anyway.

As a side note; after buying this mouse and using it for about a week with my desktop I decided to buy the Logitech G602 as well for my laptop because having a wired mouse with my laptop has been frustrating at times, especially when using it on my office desk. I'm limited in space and the mouse cord gets caught in the phone cord pretty often.",1513296000,5

I envy those who are playing it for their first times on the PS4 because they get to enjoy the game at a solid 60fps from the get go! I think the reason why I like this title so much is be cause it takes the best elements from Demons Souls and DARK SOULS and combines them to make DARK SOULS II. Anything FROM SOFTWARE touches turns to gold, but if I could only choose one game, itd most likely be this one. The main guy at FROM SOFTWARE wasn't even as involved in this as much as the other Souls/borne titles as he was primarily focusing on Bloodborne(another masterpiece,) which goes to show the amazing talent of those at FROM SOFTWARE.

3480,199,464,"Just as Shakespeare wrote plays of genius masquerading as entertainment for the masses, so Yoko Taro has crafted an epic work of genius under the guise of ""just another action hack and slash"". After having played through 45 hours and having seen all five of the main endings (and having my save file deleted by the game...wait, what?!), I am here to tell you that there are going to need to publish new editions of ""1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die"", because this is one of the greatest games ever made. Yeah, yeah, overblown hyped-up hyperbole much? Well this game sold all of what, 2 million copies in a YEAR, when say, Horizon Zero Dawn sold more than that in about a MONTH. So yes, my ridiculous yelling about how good this game is, is COMPLETELY justified. So then, on to the review!

Not Synesthesia, but Something New

First of all, this is an action game, but unlike any you have ever played. As a 30 minute YouTube review noted (SkillUp if you want to check it out), this game not only switches from third-person action game (Kingdom Hearts) to top-down shooter (Ikaruga), to Twin Stick shooter (Enter the Gungeon), to Geometry-Based Twin Stick shooter (Geometry Wars), to side-scrolling shooter (Contra), it also switches SEAMLESSLY between them. There's no load screen. The camera simply shifts or fades out and the controls stay the same. Combine that with a soundtrack that also switches seamlessly between 8-bit and orchestral versions, and quiet and dynamic versions (with and without vocals!) to adjust to what is happening, and you have something completely new in games. You have a game that changes the sights and sounds dynamically on-the-fly in tandem so that the visuals and audio are always expressing exactly the same emotion based on what you do. This is similar in concept to the game Rez, where your actions to destroy enemies make different sounds depending on what you do, but that game (while awesome), only performs on rails in 3D, and features one version of a song that you riff off of. Nier's audio/visual experience is a whole other beast entirely.

A Circus Act Desperate For Your Applause

The same YouTube review likened the pacing and theatrics of Nier:Automata to a street performer constantly having to surprise you and top what they just showed you to hold your attention and get you part with your hard-earned cash, and he's not wrong. The first act of this three act (or three play-through, if you will) game ought to make you says ""Wow!"" quite a few times. I know that I was consistently surprised, shocked, amazed, and delighted in those first 15 hours. The tutorial level shocked me by KILLING ME(!), granting me an achievement for dying (!!), and allowing me to find my own corpse and grab the items I had lost (!!!). Once you get past that tutorial (don't give up! the game is teaching you how to play, I promise!), you are in for a roller-coaster of a ride. You'll have many ""What the heck?!"" moments followed by some of the most intense boss battles you've ever seen. The structure is, again, like Kingdom Hearts. You head somewhere, a cut-scene kicks in, you have somewhere to go, or something to do, you fight Machines along the way, encounter bosses, get new items, equip them, and unlock new places to go, etc. It's just that this core gameplay is taken to it's adult limit in terms of the unexpected and awesome. You have plugin chips that radically alter how you fight and heal, but they also can take away elements of the UI if removed (or even kill you!), you have many equitable weapons for both close range and long range attacks, and this means if you aren't enjoying the game you need to alter your combat style and equipment to reflect your personal taste and the situation at hand. Brilliant.

More Than the Sum of It's Flaws

Many people who don't like this game complain about it's flawed mechanics/execution. It's open-world, but there's invisible walls where you can't go. Your attacks don't evolve as you level up and the combat is repetitive. The game varies from too easy to too hard. There isn't enough character development. The plot isn't explained obviously enough/doesn't make sense. They don't like replaying the first campaign a second time. Well...

I agree with others who have stated a 10 out of 10 doesn't have to be about perfection of mechanics and execution. It can be about being revolutionary in concept, and in a competent execution of said revolutionary concept. This game is not PERFECT. It has flaws and weaknesses. But it's 4th-wall-shattering revolutionary execution of it's concepts is so groundbreaking that the flaws just don't matter if you get what the game's creator was trying to make you experience.

The Music

A lot of people have talked about the music of this game so I'll be brief. Not only is the music amazing but it dynamically changes in response to what you are doing in the game. You need to play the game to understand what I'm talking about but suffice it to say that you need to both play the game and listen to the score on its own to fully appreciate it, because it really is THAT good. Just when you think you're starting to get tired of it and think you'll soon never want to hear it again, it gets stuck in your head and haunts your dreams.

The Plot, The Emotion, A Desolation That Leads to Joy

The first play-through of 15 hours is a shock-and-awe masterpiece of Grade A Action Movie Awesome. It tells a complete story, it's fun, it's fulfilling. But it's pretty obvious by the end that you known NOTHING about what's really going on. The second playthrough introduces a new hacking mechanic which is/can be used so often that many get tired of it. That said, it is certainly interesting, and adds, along with the new cut-scenes, a completely new dimension to the second playthrough. The second playthrough also grants you a new perspective, and has a HUGE revelation to the plot at the end that you probably saw coming a hundred miles away. Even so, it definitely adds to the game.

The third playthrough takes everything you have seen up to this point and dials it up to 11. You gain ANOTHER completely new perspective, everything you known and love is completely destroyed, and you'll likely find yourself yelling at your TV along with the protagonists ""WHAT IS GOING ON!?!?!?"" It's not as ""fun"" as the first play-through, and the big shockers are in the plot, not in the gameplay, so in a sense it's not as ""good"" as the first play-through. That said, it carries the majority of the emotional weight of the game, and let's you play as my favorite character (and it's the second half of the story), so if you want to see the entire story I think it would be absolute madness to give up after beating only the first play-through as 2B. But hey, you paid for it, do whatever you want...

The overall plot has elements of everything from Shakespeare (yes, the themes of his plays are buried in there, and even the character names are references), to The Matrix, Battlestar Galactica, and every dystopian futuristic anime you can think of (and the bible, for good measure). The character development is subtle, and if you like your plot points and character development anvil-dropped on your head you may miss the subtleties. A clenched-fist and mysterious quiet musing here echoes across multiple breakthroughs. I for one love anime stoic/heroic action girls (my fav anime archetype) so I loved 2B and A2 to death. 9S is something else but he's definitely a completely different character in the second half from the first and far less of a one-note performance than your first play-through might make you think.

ALL of the voice actors who worked on this game deserve accolades. There was ample opportunity to cheese-it-up on this game, but every voice actor in the English dub gave a heartfelt nuanced performance (superb direction of the voice acting). Easily on par with a major motion picture with the top tier of actors. And the writing of both the spoken and written dialog (didn't I mention it? how stupid of me. there's written story that's just as good and sometimes better than the cut-scenes, just so you have even MORE types of gameplay experience to draw upon for the story(!)), is absolutely superb in its translation.

If, like I was, you are feeling depressed after beating all three campaigns but have yet to play the ""true"" ending that comes after seeing both sides of the final battle, I advise you to keep going and see the final, final, FINAL conclusion of the game. Because believe it or not, the END CREDITS SEQUENCE is what is going to make this one of the greatest games you have ever played. Or...I don't know. Maybe not if you're really cynical I guess.

In The End

Never has a game made me cry like this. Never has a game shocked me like this. Never has a game made this depressed, or this happy. Never has a game made me yell ""Wow!"" so often or so loudly. Never has a game made me say ""Oh my god!"" so often and so loudly (especially in the first 20 minutes of the third play-through). And never, NEVER has a game made me yell at the screen in hopeful joyous triumph like the true ending of this game did.

If that's not enough to make you play it all the way to the fifth ending I don't know what will. And if the game's creator should ever happen to read my review I just want to say...

""Thank you Yoko Taro. Thank you. Life is worth living and I'll never give up. I swear.""

3545,802,767,"I bought this as a gift and tested it, decided to keep it and get another for the gift because I like the feel of it so much. Best wireless mouse Ive used but it has 2 problems. Still, at ~$30 its great.
1) DPI can only be set in 250 intervals unlike the G502 which can be more specific. Not huge but I prefer 1800DPI and have to use 1750 with this mouse. Only mentioning it because some people really like to use specific DPI settings.
2) The programmable buttons are limited to the preset list of options. Copy, Paste, Cut, etc. or specific keyboard keys such as Enter or Delete; you cant set commands such as Shift+Q or Fn+f8... makes the side buttons pretty useless for me honestly. The G502 can be set to pretty much anything so this really surprised me. I took some pictures to show a size/style comparrison between the G502 and G602 for those interested.

After using it a bit more I feel I should add that this mouse has some real weight to it. Being a primarily wired mouse user I guess I'm not used to the added weight of the batteries. Some people prefer a heavier mouse so this isn't necessarily a negative, and comparing it to the weight of my wired ones doesn't seem fair.",1513555200,4

3548,874,1787,"The rubber feels very nice on the controller but also the rubber around the L1 and R1 buttons slips in the way a lot which gets very annoying, so I ended up cutting off that part that covers the L1 and R1 buttons. It also covers that tiny reset button in the back on the controller no matter how I put it on. So it's not the best fit. No idea why so many people are giving this 5 stars. Wish I could at least get half my money back for this. I do love the analog grips for this a lot, far better than all the others I've ever tried.",1513555200,3
3549,870,253,My PC's bluetooth adapter is having connectivity issues which can make my controller stop working. This is pretty damning in multiplayer games so I got this adapter. It works like a charm and I haven't had any troubles since getting it.,1513555200,5

3558,792,216,"Honest review here. This is a good game but it has a few cons. For one there is no campaign mode which I think would have made this game interesting. The graphics are ok and gameplay is ok as well but it gets repetitive. When I first started playing I was having fun but eventually I picked up other releases. If you are like me who has a passion for video games then this is a must have but beware.. you will play this game for a few weeks then it will be as good as paper weight. With that being said, overall good game. Definite must have for all game enthusiasts.",1513641600,4

For $10 I've had a blast playing this! (more so than Overwatch). The biggest reason is because there is a story mode in Battleborn!

The online play is complex and intense but once you get into it, its one of the more memorable PVP games I've played.

Many of the staple LoZ elements are missing here, while the ones that are present are superficial.  Just because your main characters are Link, Zelda, Ganon,  that doesn't make this a LoZ game.  Dungeon mechanics are radically altered, as well as item procurement.  Don't slap the LoZ name on this game, and I say it's a great game, but I want a proper LoZ game...not Grand Theft Wilderness:  Zelda Edition.",1513728000,2

However, you probably won't get to experience much of it, as the game has a game breaking save corrupt glitch that will literally wipe all of your progress.  This may have been fixed by now, but games should be reviewed based on their initial state...not their ""completed"" state years later.",1513728000,1

Highlights:
- Can connect current XBOX One controllers
- Effort to connect is minimal:
--- 1) Plug in Adapter & press Connecting button
--- 2) Power on XB1 controller
--- 3) Press wireless connecter button on controller
--- 4) Once solid light on Xbox logo, you can use it!

3689,898,478,"Logitech did a great job with this mouse.  The optical sensor is a notable change from the laser I was using, and I frankly like everything about this mouse.

While your thumb doesn't go below the mouse it rests in a comfortable alcove with a grippy rubber (also where your ring and pinky fingers are) so it's both comfortable and easy to grip, and pick up to reposition.

The thumb tip button while easy to push will never be misclicked, honestly if you never wanted to use it you'll forget it's there but the dpi shift is great for hyper accurate moments, like sniping.

The pointer finger has an indentation adding again to the comfort.  The mouse is smaller in general on the palm resting area, picture reaching for a door knob, that's about the position your hand will be in with this mouse.

The logitech software that controls there equipment is very easy to use.  It auto loads the mouse and you can click to customize any of the buttons or DPI settings including 3 profiles.

To summarize I've tried a lot of mouses and after 2-3 days per mouse I keep coming back to this one.",1513900800,5

3706,905,722,"Big Review Incoming!
Total Time in Use: 1 Week

Background: I own a lot of mice. My go-to is the Logitech G403, but lately I've been hankering for something with more than 6 buttons. Typically I go to Logitech for my mice, but the G900 was a little pricey and ugly, the G502 was too heavy and the G402 lacked RGB. I wanted something that had a bunch of buttons for games/productivity wasn't a brick and wasn't terribly expensive for a ""part time"" mouse. Given that I did not anticipate using this for competitive FPS, I accepted an Avago-9800 for the sensor. You can't have it all right? More on that later.

Size: In the same league as a Deathadder or G402/G400s or G502. Slightly larger than a G403.

Shape: (8 of 10) This is clearly designed for palm grippers in mind, which is not ideal for me since I'm a fingertipper. I was concerned about the outward flare on the right side of the mouse. It is obviously intended to support the pinkie in a palm grip and I thought it would get in the way if I fingertipped. Happy, I went ahead an purchased and all is well. It feels a little different, but not bad. Palm grip is very nice (my hands are 18x9cm) and there are actually a couple comfy ways to fingertip. The way the pinky rests actually helped make the mouse grip feel very stable in-hand - so much so that I took it into several matches of CS:GO and did very well! I'm not sure if claw grippers would be happy with this mouse since the primary clicks are attached to the shell and harder to click as you move aft on the mouse. Overall, I'm happier than I expected to be with the shape.

Materials: (9 of 10) Except for the black glossy plastic running down either side along the edge, everything on this mouse is covered in a soft touch finish that feel somewhere between rubber and textured plastic. I was instantly happy with the purchase when I felt the finish. It is smooth and adequately grippy without being anywhere near giving you that icky ""gummy rubber"" sensation. My next concern was durability. After scratching at the back of the mouse with my fingernail I am convinced it will stand the test of time unless you scrape at it with something like a flat head screwdriver. The scroll wheel is covered by relatively flimsy textured rubber. I think you could pull it off if you wanted to with your nails, but I don't have any real durability concerns assuming normal usage. Overall, very happy with the materials and apparent durability.

Weight: (8 of 10) I like light mice. Lighter is better for FPS - let's just get that out of the way. To get full marks for weight, this mouse would have had to come in at 85 grams or less. I give it an 8 out of 10 because the weight is decently light, is customizable and ""terribly well balanced."" Weight was a major concern for me when buying this mouse. Even though I thought I'd use the G403 for shooters, I still didn't want to get stuck with a brick. This mouse has weight tuning and I must say that the weight tuning implementation is snazzy. You push a switch on the bottom of the mouse and a weight tray pops out of the right side of the mouse. The tray houses up to six 4 gram weights and leaves the mouse feeling nicely balanced regardless of how many weights you use because all of them are lined up centrally to the mouse. In other words, unlike other mice, this implementation will keep the mouse's center of gravity centered regardless of how many weights you use.  Terribly well balanced indeed.
I don't have an accurate weight scale at the moment, but with the weights removed I'd say this mouse is in the neighborhood of 96-98 grams - heavier than I like but acceptable and easily controlled. Even though it is heavier than my Logitech G203 and G403, it is stable enough to work just fine for ze flickshotz!

Buttons and Scroll Wheel: (8.5 of 10) The mouse 12 actuators including 5 omron switches. That's pretty decent. Primary clicks are rated at 8 million, which is hardly eye-popping, but for me, that is roughly 8 years worth of use and that assumes it is the only mouse I use. 8 million is still decent bang for the buck. The primary clicks are significantly heavier than my G403 but still quite light and nowhere near a huano. Primary clicks are moderately light but with a decent bass to them, more like a ""thwock"" than the G403's ""tick"" which makes them satisfying in a different way. The scroll wheel is notched with easy yet distinct bumps and has a very slight rattle when shaken. Clicking the scroll wheel requires moderate pressure - good stuff there. Overall, the scroll feels almost identical to my G403 but this mouse also has the benefit of tilt scroll as well. Tilt scroll is something I rarely use, but it's nice to have the option, requires only light pressure and is very easy to use. The rest of the buttons on the mouse all feel decent, the top ones behind the scroll have a dull click while the five thumb buttons all are quiet and tactile with minimal pressure and travel required. Regarding button placement, it's not too bad, but I do have trouble hitting the two rearmost buttons (M4 and M5) independently. If it were me, I'd have designed M4 and M5 as a single button and added another button below the thumb on the left ""wing"" of the mouse, much like the Cougar 600M. Thankfully, if I fail to get the hang of it over the longer term, I can just disable one of them using the software. Overall, buttons are good.

Sensor: (7 out of 10) I've owned a couple mice before this one that had an Avago-9800 sensor. I could not stand them - they were good mice in many ways and I really wanted to love them, but the sensor ruined everything for me because I couldn't take them into CS:GO - the acceleration was just that bad. My expectations for this mouse were similarly low, but I figured I'd just use it for browsing/word processing and switch to a ""proper"" mouse/sensor like the G403 when I wanted to kill stuff dead. I tested the mouse in a match of CS:GO just to remind myself how inferior the 9800 is compared to the 3366. I had 31 kills to 12 deaths my first match...without warmup...on minimal sleep...with a new mouse. Wut? Next match I went 21-12, landing quality shots all the way. In fact, in the last week, I have yet to have a game with a negative kill/death ratio...I thought it was just luck until I saw that this mouse actually has a Avago 9800+ sensor and claims to NOT have acceleration or angle snapping. Well, huh. The 3366 still feels snappier and less ""floaty"" than this one, but where the 3366 is a 10, this is an 7, which is to say decent enough and apparently improved over the old A-9800 which I would have given a 5 out of 10 score. The fact that this mouse could actually be acceptable for shooters has meant that I don't feel the need to switch mouses when gaming. That means the G403 has been missing from my desk for a week now and that I have a $25 mouse that has supplanted a top of the line mouse that I spent $60 on. I think the G403 is the best mouse I've ever had, but given my work/gaming mix right now, the Tecknet is more practical as the daily driver for the time-being.

Software: (Score: 7 of 10) Easy to download, easy to navigate, tons of features including robust macro options and it does not hog system resources. Unobtrusive tool tray icon that actually doesn't stand out enough. You can control macros, DPI profiles, lighting color and breathing rate as well as set different X and Y sensitivity to name a few. As with many peripheral software packages these days, the software does leave you wanting more. It takes a while to boot up and close down. Saving your settings takes several seconds and provides no feedback other than the swirly icon stopping and leaving you wondering ""did it actually save?"" Managing colors is tedious thanks to the interface and changing colors does not happen until after you hit save, meaning that you have to hit save and wait several seconds and repeat several times over in order to tweak the right color shade. Overall the software is perfectly functional and given that I don't need to spend a whole lot of time in it, I don't weigh these negatives very heavily at all and neither should you.

Lighting: (6 out of 10) Lighting is good (albeit a little awkward in the software) but colors appear just slightly washed out relative to my RGB Logitech mice. Also, the illuminated ""TECKNET"" appearing on the mouse is hardly awe-inspiring. The main reason I'm taking points off here is because the orange thumb button lights cannot be changed from orange. For me this is a non-issue since I use a green/orange theme, but others will be irked.

Overall Design and Closing Thoughts: It's not very flashy or expensive and it does not have a premium gaming sensor. BUT the quality is pretty good. The ergonomics are good. The sensor is passable. The functionality and productivity potential is higher than a typical 6-8 button gaming mouse. While nothing about the mouse is truly groundbreaking, a mouse is more about value and function than form for me. None of the flaws listed above justify taking a star off the Amazon rating in my mind, especially given the price point. This is a very versatile mouse that feels just as at home in CS:GO as it does in Word, Excel or Powerpoint. Assuming it holds up over the long haul, it offers superb bang for the buck and easily merits 5 stars as my general ""do-it all"" mouse until something on it breaks.",1513900800,5

I thought the characters were lovely (age controversy aside/I really wish Japan would start using adults in their stories already) the voice acting was lovely, and the motivations and mistakes made sense from a human standpoint.

3736,916,852,"My own fault: I'm sure the description would have told me this but... It's only 9v. My Gen1 SNES requires a 10v. So, this is NOT an universal power supply, unless you're looking for fragmented graphics and other PS symptoms. Got an actual SNES adapter and bam. SNES works fine. Be warned: while these seem to work just fine for my Genesis/CD/32X monstrosity, this thing barely has the power to turn an SNES on. One star for every console and addon these things do power. They weigh less than air, so we'll see how long they last; but for less than $5 a pop, I can't complain too much.

Update!
They died. So for the Genesis/CD/32X I just got some One Spot adapters at the local music shop. Cheaper than the original, but only use on outlet on a strip at a time. And finally broke down and ordered a legit 32X adapter because these just acted weird. Had to drop a star.",1514160000,2

3739,905,2088,"This mouse was purchased for my wife's new RGB setup. I thought I had a steal on my hands. The new 50 million click omron switches plus RGB lighting and a legit 3310 sensor all for 25 bucks? Sign me up, that's a great value! I'll take that over a Sensei 310 any day!

Well...not so fast. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Upon hooking it up to the wife's laptop Christmas morning I started looking for the driver software online. There isn't any. Finding the mouse on the MSI website was a pain, it's not even listed in their mouse lineup page.
(https://us.msi.com/Gaming-gear/#?category=Mouse)
I read the manual. DPI switching takes place on the mouse by pressing and holding the rearmost thumb button on both sides and holding for 5 seconds. This method is also how you change the color breathing between off, fast breathing and slow breathing. And, as it turns out, there is no RGB, only red illumination on the logo. Minus 1 star for false advertising MSI!

Also, because there is no software, there is no macro capability for this mouse. But wait, it gets worse. There is a handy-dandy switch on the bottom of the mouse with three detents labeled ""L"", ""R"" and one with a padlock icon. These are advertised to lock the left thumb buttons for use by a left hander, lock the right side thumb buttons for use by right-hander or lock both sets of thumb buttons for office use. I have a couple issues here. First, the main issue is that you cannot use more than two thumb buttons - you can't use all 4 side buttons on the mouse at once! Even if you could the buttons on the far side are too small, too stiff and have too much travel to be very practical in-game. Locking out ALL the side buttons makes no sense. The thumb buttons would not get in the way during office use. The padlock setting should be an ""all buttons available"" mode instead of none. There might be technical considerations here given there is no software, but it still seems like a poor design decision. Minus 1 star for decreased functionality and design. The second, smaller issue is that L actually locks out right side thumb buttons and vice-versa, opposite as described in the manual, but that's a minor gripe.

So, given the lack of software, macros, RGB and full thumb button utility, what is good about the mouse? Well, it's actually pretty good if you're looking for a basic 6 button mouse with good tracking and an ambidextrous shape. Ergonomics are solid for palm and fingertip but not ideal for claw. The side grips are not rubber, in fact everything is textured plastic on the mouse. It feels nice, but the feel is not as premium as the my wife's previous mouse, the DS100, which not only had a soft touch rubber coating but software support and multiple color options. I'm not bitter...honest.

I'd say that mouse weight is around 95 grams without the flexible braided cable. Tracking is superb as you'd expect with a 3310 and all button clicks are nice and crisp. The primary L/R clicks are awesome, up there with the Logitech G403. Biggest gripe regarding buttons are the thumb buttons. They have significant travel but not too bad but don't stick out very far from the mouse, making unintentional presses hard, but making intentional ones slightly awkward as well - minor gripe. There are 3 large mousefeet which have excellent glide, no issues there. The scroll wheel middle click requires significantly more force than the others, but that's typical. There is a nice rubber coating on the scroll and the wheel has moderate resistance with distinct notches, good for gaming, fine for browsing.

In terms of overall build quality, this mouse is very solid and does not have any kind of rattle or creak when shaken/squeezed. I'd expect this mouse to last a long time. Of course, this review is being written less than a week after purchase. I would have said the same about the last MSI mouse (DS100) which developed a LMB double click issue after less than 1 million clicks and 2 years of light use. (I use Mousotron on all my computers to track such things) The DS100 was rated for 5 million clicks, so it developed issues less than 20% of the way into its advertised lifespan. The wife loved the DS100 and wanted another MSI so the OCD could be satisfied - you simply must have the mouse brand match the laptop brand after all.

She is happier with the mouse than me at this point, which is something of a relief, she is not nearly the mouse officianado that I am, and red (the only lighting color available) does happen to be her favorite color.

In summary, there are aspects of this buying experience that are definitely not cool but we're keeping this rodent and hoping it grows on us:)",1514160000,3
3740,569,1381,"Ghost recon is an amazing game, The graphics are good and the gameplay is fun. In single player it lacks a little bit because of clunky A.I. The game really shines and comes to life when you have friends to explore the world with you. .
The story was well written and decent, but the multiplayer is where this game really takes off.

You can have different patterns, sequences, colors all going at once. There's presets, and you can even customize you're own! I've had this for 7 months now and I can definitely say, all and all, great gamer/non-gamer keyboard. If you like keyboards that have RGB color features, than this is the keyboard for you.",1514160000,5
3745,365,893,"This game is a fun, linear first person shooter. The story is ok, but it doesn't add much to the Resistance lore. It basically just shows the Chimera invasion of the United States. There is a little conspiracy plot which is interesting. My biggest problem with the plot is that the main character is just a normal human, yet fights as well as Nathan Hale. Resistance 3 also did this.
Graphics: 4/5. Good looking game, but the resolution does produce shimmering effects.
Gameplay: 4/5. The game is easy yet fun. There is a variety of weapons to use.
Audio: 2/5. Soundtrack is ok, but the sound effects are pretty dull.

The multiplayer is still up, but is totally dead. You will have to boost the one MP trophy with someone else. The MP was pretty lame. The guns and maps are ok, but the time-to-kill is WAY too short. This makes the secondary function of weapons almost pointless, and the game feel too much like Call of Duty.",1514160000,4

3747,365,1572,"This game is my all-time favourite multiplayer game. I feel that the classes are perfectly balanced. It isn't perfect, but it is a whole lot of fun.
Graphics: 5/5. This is a good looking PS3 game. Yes it's only 30fps and 720p, but for a PS3 game it looks pretty good. The destruction physics are probably the best on the platform. Few games allow you to cause many small objects to fly into the air.
Audio: 5/5. The gun sounds and explosions are phenomenal. I often use audio clues to figure out where the enemy is. The soundtrack is composed of good orchestra tracks. Much better than Battlefield 3 and 4's techno soundtracks.
Gameplay: 5/5. The single player campaign is linear yet still fun. The story is predictable, but the funny dialogue makes up for it. The Multiplayer is incredible. Onslaught is a really fun DLC mode where you fight bots on the multiplayer maps. You need at least one other person to beat them on hardcore difficulty though.",1514160000,5
3748,747,478,"I have mixed feelings about this mouse. The mouse itself is amazing. It has plenty of buttons, an amazing sensor with 1 to 1 tracking (I tested it), and an option to switch between a free moving scroll wheel and a normal one. With that said, there are a number of things I found that took away from this mouse.

Being someone with doll hands this mouse felt nice in my hand. But due to the way I hold it (I use a palm grip), my thumb is forced into an awkward position that simply isn't comfortable. I caught myself constantly shifting my hand around, just trying to find a comfortable position for my fingers. The buttons my the thumb are way too high for my personal preference, and to me were very difficult to click mid game.

The right side of the mouse for me was a complete failure. Once again, this could be due to my rather small hand size, but I couldn't, for the life of me, get my fingers to stay on on the mouse.

The biggest flaw in my eyes that made me feel the need to refund this product was the feet on the mouse. For whatever reason, I hold my mouse so that more pressure goes on the right side of the mouse than the left. This extra pressure on the right would cause the mouse to slightly ""roll"" clockwise in the air. This ever so slight roll would cause a contact failure between the feet of the mouse and the surface it was being used on. As a result, the mouse would skid around, as if I had simply ripped the feet off the mouse. This would constantly distract me from the games I would be playing (Primarily CS:GO, my usual go-to mouse tester) and get me killed due to the loss of accuracy. This flaw completely ruined my experience using this mouse. I have since gone back to using my old Steelseries mice, as they don't have this same issue as the g502 does.",1514160000,2

3753,497,394,"I would LOVE to give this game 5 stars, I really would.  In many ways it was more streamlined and better then the 2nd, but there is just a few too many glitches and issues to ignore.  Wandering why you somehow got taken out by a soldier standing in an area that makes no sense?  You'll find out several games later when the landscape doesn't form for YOU properly and you are doing the same things to other players.  There was one time I probably drove the plant team insane trying to figure out WHO THE SNOT IS SHOOTING THE SUNFLOWER LIGHTHOUSE (this will make sense once you play Gardens and Graveyards mode).  Well is was me......not inside the lighthouse.  Because it was one of the few times I've had this occur to my advantage.

Using the Garlic drone and Engineer bot is risky business.  When those things get shot down, there is about a 5% chance your game is just NOT going to load back properly to your actual character.

These and a few other glitches notwithstanding........this is the GOLD STANDARD on how to do ""Pack Progression"" correctly.  Random unlocks are nothing to be feared.  Gamers have turned into spoiled little biotches thinking the ENTIRE game should be unlocked immediately.  The game rewards you for doing ANYTHING in the form of in game currency.  This then can be spent on a large assortment of ""sticker packs"" which give you anything from summonable zombies, plantable plants, cosmetic adjustments, modified abilities, new character variants (which all play a bit differently from the base class with a different primary weapon) and more.

The game also rewards individual classes for doing their job.  Engineers can make bank by establishing forward teleporter positions, making it easier for you team to raid (and getting coins everytime someone then uses it).  Cactus get extra coins if OTHER classes are able to take advantage of well placed cover.  Chompers get a hefty amount of coins for ""shield breaking"" the outer shell of tougher zombies with a burrow emerge (no idea why this got omitted from the second game).  Pretty much every class has special coin boosts and it promotes newer and inexperienced players to AT LEAST do their job if nothing else.

As for basic random progression, this should be considered a good thing.  Some folks will get frustrated that they don't get exactly the variants the want and have no where specific to go to find them, but the upside is it makes it a VERY unique experience for every player.  I still remember my first Zombie unlock on my XBOX One account, The Goalie Star.  To me, he looked great, did a little less damage then normal but slowed and froze enemies, and gave me my love for the All-star Class.  A friend of mine unlocked the Toxic Pea first, arguably the best ""trooper"" type on the plant side, played that guy once and never looked back.  This makes for a fun experience where you never know what you are going to get.  These classes all have downsides to their standard variant, and don't break the game that some players get some before others.

One could argue that there are 3 upgrade stickers that get thrown into the sticker pool once a particular zombie or plant has been unlocked and they are too weak to play until you get those.  One, the upgrades are marginal.  Two, you gain a crap ton of coins from the co-operative mode, Garden Ops, which you can play until you unlock those. Three, there is always the welcome matt you can play until you get enough coins to buy more packs to unlock their extras.

Finally, the achievement vs experience system is great.  To level up your characters, you need accomplish achievements such us a particular move so many times, take out so many enemies, or even take out so many players.  Some of these can be rather circumstantial, tricky, or just plain really difficult.  Not to worry.  The packs have you covered on that as well.  As you are opening packs you get ""Star Challenge Skip"" stickers which always you to automatically unlock that achievement.  So basically, however you want to play the game, you will eventually, through attrition, get everyone to max level anyway (which is more a bragging thing then anything.  The later levels just give you additional coins, not more hit points or new stickers or anything).  It allows the game to be goal oriented, encourages players to try new things, but at the end of the day, if you are struggling or the other players are making it impossible to accomplish some (take out Bonk Choy plants for example.....if the players aren't planting them, you can't exactly get this done) you can skip it.  And you earned it by some other means, since that was you sticker in your pack!!

So all and all, it would be nice for more games to use this overall method of progression if they are going the ""pack/loot box"" route with microtrans as a side income.  At no point did I feel I needed to buy additional coins, and there was an obvious ""pros vs cons"" for any character that I saw people using once I really got a decent amount of exposure to them before I got them.

(As a side, the one exception was the Tank Commander Zombie.  I was always floor how fast they could kill me all of a sudden and thought they must be broken and was confused I didn't see them more......until I unlocked him.  Guy is literally running around with a tank cannon that is hard to hit with, doesn't do the greatest damage, until you CRIT on someone.  Explains the sudden drops, and always explains the seldom use)",1514246400,4

3804,677,545,"This review will be a little hefty as I plan on reviewing the main game collection as one and then I picked a game at random to review to give potential buyers an idea of what to expect from a typical 90s era SEGA game.

GAME COLLECTION:

 PROS

1. Good set for the money. Lots of classics here  7 or so sonic games, golden axe, altered beast, comix zone. There is a good chunk I am not familiar with, but paying 20 or so dollars for even just the sonic games is a pretty decent deal.

2. Decent amount of video options. Either a 4:3 pillar boxed reminiscent of the old tube tvs  or a stretched 16:9 to fill a wide screen monitor  which looks like ass. You can also smooth the sprites, but they make everything look all melty and terrible. Just play without it

3. Games I tested ran smoothly  sonic 3, shining force, phantasy star II. Didnt have any audio sync issues or weird video lag.

4. Games looked nice. Despite the age and technology, the sprites and backgrounds hold up really well in the HD presentation

5. You can remap controls if that is your thing.

6. Nice to be able to save from the console options rather than having to save in game at designated locations.

CONS:

1. Despite having a smoothing filter, there are no other filters present that would be included in a typical emulator  scanlines, etc.

2. There are video and control options, but I wasn't able to find audio options in the games I tested.  I would prefer to hear the music track louder than the text scroll or game effects. I suspect the old games have everything mixed together which is why this option is omitted.

3. No way to speed up gameplay. Another staple of emulation is being able to speed up games 2X, 4X, 8X, or more to get through boring animations, text boxes, or just grinding out random battles. This option seems to be missing here.

SHINING STAR:

 I wanted to pick a game I had NO familiarity with as to not let nostalgia bias my critique. I am playing this game blind, without any help from the internet.

 PROS:

1. Sprites are a good representation of what SEGA Genesis was capable of at the time.

2. Very straight forward story. Doesnt drown you in exposition. You start the game and you are thrust into action.

3. Good gameplay  VERY similar to Fire Emblem or FF Tactics, which I like. Even has the promotion aspect to level your characters.

4. Interaction is a neat idea, but flawed in execution.

5. Interesting characters and locations.

6. Hard but rewarding battles.

CONS:

1. Inventory is limited. Can only hold 4 items on a character and there is no backpack or caravan to dump items into.

2. No way to know what items do. Especially health items. You go to a shop and expect a quick menu or something that says the herbs will replenish 10 HP or something, but it just isn't there. Only by using the items do you learn their properties.

3. Turn order is a mystery. No on screen meter or anything to let you know how many enemy turns it takes to be yours.

4. Enemy turns take forever. You will be up against about 15  20 enemies and you must watch ALL of their turns. Even if they do not move. There is no way to speed it up or skip it.

5. Cannot speed up or skip text, battle animations, turn moves. Everything happens in real time and is pretty slow once you are on about move 30 and just trying to kill the enemy.

6. I mentioned that the interaction is a neat idea, but flawed. The game ties everything to an action choice box pop up and you have to choose talk look item. It is kind of like a point and click game on PC, but doesnt really work on console. It would be easier if all inventory options like healing items, equipment, status were tied to the START button (like normal) and the A button (or X on PS3) just let you talk to people. I don't know why search needs to be hidden under a popup, just have me talk/search with the same button.

Overall the game is a product of its time. Most RPGs in the early 90s were still in their infancy. A lot of these quality of life options probably won't be introduced for a few years, but it is definitely hard to go back and play an older game with modern game styles on the mind. I never would have liked this as a kid. Sonic games were my bread and butter and simple hack n slash games like Golden Axe. This game requires patience, strategy, forethought, and resource conservation. Nine year old me would have been miserable. No wonder I never heard of this game before

I would recommend this collection if you can get it for under 20 dollars. Like I said, just getting the basic classics most people are familiar with makes having this worth it. There are definitely some lost gems to get introduced to, but be aware that these games are over 20 years old and probably won't play like you wish they would.",1514419200,4

3818,501,518,"Warframe follows the golden path approach of pay-to-win MMORPG's. You ""can"" pay $400 to instantly get every piece of gear, every buff, every prime Frame, every everything, and you'd still be only better-than-average.

PROS:
Gorgeous graphics
Great mission variety
Great and diverse Bosses
Beautiful tutorials
Entertaining and varied characters
No Pay-to-win, mostly Pay-to-look-cool with some Pay-For-An-Edge
User designed content that doesn't suck

CONS:
Steep learning
Some tutorials are absent
Weird market setup
Some levels impossible to solo
Some bizarre leveling mechanics

Graphics and gorgeous. While you can tell they lifted the Infected from Halo, the environs and the characters are beautifully drawn and decently varied on some central themes. Otherwise the levels, even when repetitious, are only really noticeable at the start and end, and are so enormous that really only starts to crop out after 30+hours of play.

This is even better on PS4. Every mechanic is simplified and works great. You have to grind for components to make new gear and warframes, but otherwise you're in a march across the solar system.

The story is actually pretty good, and is gradually revealed in sidebars and codex entries, as well as a steadily growing number of quests and campaigns. The bosses are fun and have a reason to grind up as they provide mats to make new Warframes by the boss.

There are a few humps. Right around Mars and again around Saturn, the difficulty takes a significant jump. Grinding starts in full force at that point, but its varied enough and fleshed out enough that it feels like a 10% grinding as opposed to WOW grinding. You collect materials to make new gear and weaponry, do alerts and syndicates to get access to speciality items and powers and apparel, and begin participating in PVP and major events, so theres so much to do once you hit a grindwall that its a major annoyance but not a derailment of the progression.

PVP also adds a decent flavor. Even a vanilla level 1 guy with little experience can still get a some decent points.

As usual, the only real limit is the paywall. Not for anything significant, but you're limited in the number of slots you have for mechs, weps and drones, meaning that you could get stuck with only 1 suit, and be required to fork out $20 for platinum to get the slot for a second one. Its also irritating that you can pay for stuff with platinum, and they bury the mechanism by which you can get it with in game currency as a blueprint.",1514419200,5

3821,44,173,"This review is for the PS4 limited edition version.

After playing the Ezio collection about a year ago, I was hooked on the AC series.  So, I bought this game along with Syndicate and Black Flag and although I have had some issues with the different games, I have enjoyed playing the series.  With the last three games, I have played them a bit out of order in terms of when they were released by playing Syndicate (2015), then Black Flag (2013) before playing Unity, which was release between those two in 2014.

One of my complaints with the Ezio collection and black flag is the awkward feel of the controls, especially for jumping and climbing which didn't feel smooth.  I eventually got use to it, but even after playing through those games, I still struggled at times with the jump and climbing.  Syndicate fixed those issues with easier climbing and smoother controls overall.  Luckily, Unity plays more like Syndicate in that respect with climbing and jumping.  The only complaint I have about the control layout is the change from how you access your vision, which moved to the triangle button as opposed to how it has been in all the other games.  Maybe it is because I got use to how it was in Syndicate, but I am constantly hitting the triangle in the middle of combat.  The eagle vision last only a temporary period of time, which I am not sure I am a fan of either.

As it with the other AC games that I have played, there is lots to do with the main missions, side missions and collecting stuff.  The collecting of the various objects throughout the game are the least favorite aspect of all of the AC games as they are time consuming and repetitive.  Although not as difficult to find as in Syndicate, some are hard to locate and see, even with the new 3D map.  I haven't decided if I like the 3D map as in some instances it does help and some ways it doesnt.  Locating some objects, especially those inside buildings can be a bit of a pain as the map and distance to object doesnt always clearly mark the location.

The missions and side missions are pretty similar to the previous games and very similar to Syndicate in a lot of ways.  The landscape is detailed and well done with really good graphics as I have come to expect with the latter AC games.  The basic gameplay is essentially the same as most of the AC games that I have played.  It makes it easy to get started and playing but at the same time, it only has a few additions to make it different than the previous games.

There is plenty to see and do though and it is fun to explore around the city, including the inside of various buildings.  I do wish there was more interactive with the people and environment in the city.

Like the other AC games, there are the occasional glitchy camera views that make it hard to see and do things, such as the landscape blocking my view in the middle of a fight.  There is still some finicky-ness with button pushes at times at certain locations but not as bad as the earlier games.  I miss the grapple gun from Syndicate which at least so far, I don't think is in Unity.  Considering I am getting into this game 3 years after release, I avoided most of the early game bugs and got the game for less than 20 bucks on top of it.

Unity can be played in conjunction with a Unity phone app but I found the app game to be pretty boring and glitchy as it disconnects quite frequently.  It tended to slow my game down instead of enhancing it.

The missions are a bit tougher than Syndicate and Black Flag in my opinion.  The fighting doesnt feel as smooth as Syndicate though.  The story is ok as well, maybe not as strong as the other games in the series but I found it entertaining enough.

I am not a big MP gamer but there are Coop missions as well which can be a change of pace.

Although this doesnt stray far from the AC formula, the game is still fun to play even with some of its flaws.

There is no numpad obviously but we shan't count that as a negative as we all knew that going in, although you will still be reaching out for one if you are used to it for awhile.

Pros: build quality, it's a tank.
Price
Very loud and clicky keys, satisfying
Supposedly water resistant, water drains out a small hole in the bottom.

Cons:
Loud (bad for cohabitation with fellow humanoids)
Styling is meh, arguably childish (or man childish)
None other given the price point

3902,456,319,"I have played every game since its inception. I have also owned every special edition too. What I struggled with this series so far... is the guardian galaxy. Im not a fan of their weapons, or characters. They look great, but perform poorly. Master Chief and Cortana were a magical duo. I remember spending hours with friends playing halo 1-3. Nastolgia is a word that comes to mind. Unfortunately this particular Halo gets lost in transistion. I feel its trying too hard to accomplish too many things at once. I get that they're trying to give us a break from the MC. However, we don't want that, or at least I don't want that. For some reason I miss the challenges of the covenant and the flood. It was also creepy, I remember the first halo when you meet the flood for the first time. Or 343, not the company but the character. Theres no memborable moments that the original conquest set out to do. I want development, not conflicting paths, and weird aliens. Home is where the heart is and the covenant and cortona aren't its main space. I do love the graphics, ( I got the collection series ).

I also play all of them on legendary and this game has got some points more than other that get so retarded hard it makes me not want to play. I have always had a challenge but never like this to where Im finding loopholes in the game. I enjoyed clearing out a section of foes, and moving to the next.

The Ai is really hit or miss. Sometimes I just watch them when they're trying to heal me just stand or turn around despite me signaling for help. Not as bad as sheva and Chris off of RE5, but not as great as others.

343 really needs to approach a new game, with organic enemies that bring back the sense of fear, heroism and bad-assery that we come to love.

And on a certain level, I really, REALLY enjoy analyzing things that are interesting.

Skyrim: Mass Effect OR Arkham City: Primal

A lot of people don't see the connections between this game and Skyrim, Mass Effect, Arkham City, and Farcry:Primal, but to me they are clear to see. It's got the focus which mimics ""Detective Vision"" and ""Hunter Vision"" with it's alternate HUD overlay that highlights certain things. It's got the Mass Effect Conversation Wheel, and silent ""takedowns"" which can be upgraded (slightly). And yes, there's the endless icons cluttering up the map for all the locations and sidequests that you can travel to, a ""fast-travel"" system, and even dungeons (excuse me, CAULDRONS) that feature switches to flip and over-powered bosses to slay. So yes, this game wears it's inspirations on it's sleeve. My first impression: this is the game that Mass Effect:Andromeda SHOULD have been. It's a new world, set in the distant future, that blends science fiction and primitive survival. What a great idea!

Do You Enjoy Fighting For Your Life?

Whether or not you enjoy this game is really going to come down to one question. Do you enjoy the combat? Because if you don't, you aren't going to like this game in all likelihood. Most people seem to be over the moon for the combat for some reason. They love notching arrows, shooting weak points, sneaking up on enemies, performing stealth kills, and thwacking robot dinosaurs over the noggin with a spear. In truth, the combat is deeply flawed and uneven, but some people (or most, apparently) ENJOY the unevenness, and for them, this game is a little piece of heaven.

The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly

The good points of this game are VERY good. The graphics are AMAZING. To the point where I spent a whole lot of time just taking pictures using the photo mode, trying to achieve different framed shots. The combat is nothing if not exciting, and at times, downright awesome. When the game is scripted, it's one of the best scripted adventures I've ever seen, with Prince of Persia style climbing (only better), Arkham City style takedowns from behind, and scripted boss fights and cinematics that are every bit as soon as a summer blockbuster. The problem is...the best parts of this game are few and far between, and poorly implemented, despite the layers and layers and LAYERS of polish (seriously, there are fewer glitches in this game than any I have ever seen). For example:

The story beats for this game are all over the place. There's a deep mystery over Aloy's origin, and deep drama over her status as an outcast at the start of the game. I was REALLY looking forward to a thirty-plus hour adventure to resolve these things. Unfortunately they are both resolved in the first five hours. WHAT?????? I've heard that some people quit this game after the first few hours after resolving these story elements, I can completely understand why. 90% of the impetus to keep playing is immediately removed. There's a mystery about WHY exactly Aloy was born how she was, and what it means, and there's a mystery about a mysterious evil group, but if you've played Mass Effect or Knights of the Old Republic you're probably already groaning when you discover you have to hunt down and take down the Black Suns, I mean Blue Suns, I mean Shadow Carja, I mean Eclipse (whew! I'm tired just thinking about how many times I've taken down the same thugs!). And since I've already discovered I'm a Sith Lord, and the Hero who can unite a Galaxy, and a clone of Sephiroth, I really don't care how or why I was born, especially when I've lived my entire life as an outcast and been raised by an awesome man who exits the story right after it starts. So yeah, the story isn't exactly new. Yes, there is a heavy-handed ridiculous story about the world that's so far fetched I struggled to suspend my disbelief (somehow transforming a planet is easier than hacking a SHUTDOWN CODE??????), but other than a few blockbuster cinematics, this story is told through audio logs and text documents so boring I recommend skipping them all.

It's great that there's a Mass Effect Weapon Wheel. Crafting on the fly is unrealistic but appreciated. But there is so much wrong with this game in terms of management systems of all kinds. For starters, you need to buy or craft fast-travel packs until you purchase an unlimited one. This is a design decision that's beyond stupid. There's camp sites where you can save just about everywhere, but they clutter up the map and frequently spawn you right next to enemies that immediately kill you. Worse yet they are a terrible wasted opportunity. In Panzer Dragoon Saga when you visit a campfire you can save, yes. But you also get to listen to an old man tell you the history of the world and build a bond with your dragon. Those campfire lore minutes were my single favorite part of that game, and I weep for the lost opportunity here.

The need to constantly pick up resources so you can craft ammo and healing items is absolutely ridiculous and tedious. Your health doesn't auto-regenerate, so it's completely possible to be stranded in the middle of nowhere with no healing items, no fast-travel packs, no medicinal herbs, almost no health, and be surrounded by hostile robot dinosaurs. Not my idea of fun.

Then there's the highly un-customizable outfits which somehow manage to be boring, and provide such a limited number of effects that you are constantly switching which one you are wearing to combat just one type of enemy (as opposed to the armors in Mass Effects where you just swap upgrades into your best armor which features all kinds of bonuses, AND looks awesome). Again, crafting ammo on the fly is cool, but why on Earth do you have to craft it at all? It pretty much just ensures that when you need it most, you run out of the one type of ammo you really need and have absolutely no way of getting more.

Then there's the inventory system which seems to have been borrowed straight out of Skyrim. You have hundreds of items which are pretty much useless except to change into money, constantly cluttering up your inventory and forcing you to either discard items or visit merchants to sell huge amounts, either way a huge waste of time and effort. Yuck! All of this could have easily been solved by simply giving you regenerating health! And then there's the quest system...

I never would have climbed a single tallneck or gone through a single cauldron if my wife had not told me to. After I went through two of each, I failed to see why on Earth I did it. Neither was fun, and both were time-consuming. Even worse, the game at no time made it clear that it was important that I do these things. After the prologue, and talking to several people in the village there should have been QUESTS to go the cauldron and the tallneck, and some story-driven REASON for doing so. I found the same with all the other side-quests. Whether or not I found quests (and apparently I missed most of them when I finished the game) was purely random. The game told me at completion I had accomplished less than 50% of the game. This is just plain bad design. I've played the Mass Effect Trilogy countless times, and quests are brought to your attention frequently, allowing you to encounter them and complete them naturally. In HZD it seemed like every time I encountered a quest it wanted me to go in the opposite direction of the main story, and it seems to have absolutely no bearing on said main story. Is it any wonder I only completed a few of the quests?

And then there's the combat. Oh boy. This game had a great opportunity to allow you to craft a warrior who is fast and maneuverable equipping light armor that grants greater speed. But it doens't. Light armor is simply WORSE than heavy armor. Again, yuck! NO increased agility or dodge, just more resistance to the stupid elements. Likewise, if you aren't fond of stealth (I am generally not), you can't craft Aloy into a burly tank of destruction because close-range attacks are almost completely broken, and getting hit close range can so easily kill you. Its worth mentioning that at close range dodge/roll is useless. Seemingly just being CLOSE to attacks takes a bite out of your health. I dodged and dodged and dodged...and died. This is not Nier:Automata where a perfectly timed dodge kicks off combos. In fact, there ARE no close range attack combos. :( This is even sadder because your spear attacks are so bland and awkward, and CANNOT be used defensively. You should be able to lock spear to jaw with the robots and hold them at bay. You should be able to stab at them with your spear to ward them off and get space or escape. Instead you frequently get cornered into a nook and can't see where you are or the beast is, blinding thwacking with your spear like how you wield a sword like a club in Skyrim. This is straight-up TERRIBLE combat.

Add in a run command you use by clicking down on the left stick (instead of simply running when you pressing the left stick all the way in a direction), and you have a recipe for repeated deaths due to bad controls (Aloy should be able to run while crouched, and while in combat should NEVER walk).

The Focus Vision deserves special mention here as a feature that is EXTREMELY poorly implemented. Unlike Hunter Vision or Detective Vision, this ""feature"" does not make HUD elements unnecessary (it doesn't show you where critical plot people are, or important plants are), and it slows you to a CRAWL while you have it enabled. I turned it on all the time only to find it showed me nothing. In combat it's almost useless as I'm standing there like a log while the beasts rip me to shreds, because I""m trying to ""focus"" on them to see their weak point. Ugh! What a pain in the neck!

And last but not least, there are WAY too many dinosaur encounters, and far too many that are ridiculously overpowered, to the point where they become extremely annoying, and the override ability is just about useless. Frequently I was on my way to a story mission, and got ambushed by robot dinos I had no intention of fighting, and suddenly I was fighting for my life, wondering why on Earth I had to KILL the poor beasties just to get where I was going. This usually led to multiple frustrating deaths and/or fast-traveling straight to my mission, which was incredibly frustrating because I ENJOY traveling across the world of HZD when robot dinos aren't constantly trying to kill me! Speaking of which, while I appreciate the lack of blood and gore, why are there no no-lethal methods of dealing with dinos and bandits? I felt like a monster killing hordes of both that were minding their own business, just so I could get a save point and craft items that I desperately needed.

I loved riding on dinos, but I almost never got to do it in the game and that is really really sad. I stopped doing cauldrons after two because I was almost never able to override dinos. 99% of the time when I encountered them they already saw me and so it was too late to attempt override, and they were the wrong kind of beasts to ride anyway. When I COULD override an enemy and ride them, I almost always had to quickly dismount after a short time because the game forced me to.

The Awesome

If I have so many things I don't like about this game, why do I give it four stars? Because despite all the low points, mediocre points, and abundant frustrations, despite all the flaws and examples of bad design, this game does some things REALLY well.

Aloy is one of the greatest video game characters ever created. Despite her rather thin backstory and cheesy dialog, Ashly Burch brings the character to life so completely that everyone and anyone will fall in love with her. While you are running across the game world, Aloy keeps a constant running commentary on everything happening (a trick stolen from the awesome Tomb Raider:Legend) which keeps you from feeling depressed, lonely, and desolate. Everything about this character is amazing. The voice acting, yes. But the facial animation (which is the best I've ever seen for EVERY character in the game) is the absolute pinnacle for Aloy. Her young, earnest, perfectly expressive, courageous, idealistic, hopeful face commands your attention and brings the character to life (I suspect some extremely high quality motion capture). But more than that. When she walks, she walks like a young woman (her hips sway as she confidently strides), she stalks like a Native American (hunched down powerfully to spring into action, stealthily sneaking through the underbrush), and her HAIR is a character unto itself. I wish she got dirt or mud on her face and washed it off in the mountain streams (or took a drink of water). I wish she slept in inns to restore her health and laughed and sang around the campfire. I wish she shouted out across the mountains to other braves, and I wih more than anything she rode a strider alongside other warriors to hunt machines (because she spends far too much time alone), but what she is in this game is still incredible and deserving of all the praise I can muster.

When the story in this game is good it's AMAZING. I hated going through most of the old purple-hued buildings searching for who know's what in auto-logs and such, but I loved the the late game cinematics and story-based climbing missions. The prologue of the game has thrilling platforming, rousing music, and heart-wrenching emotion (not enough to make me cry, but still). I just wish there was more of it, instead of all the open-world machine killing frustration which felt so empty and pointless. Likewise the musical score for this game is excellent. I wish more of it was slow-paced and melancholy instead of so much action music, but it's still a fine score.

And while I had many, many serious issues with the combat (that swapping out weapons in your slot is necessary, and the icons and usage of support items is so incredibly counter-intuitive, and pretty much no one uses the tedious and mostly useless traps), when it worked, it REALLY worked. The first time I encountered a Stormbird (after trying to hide from it for 10 minutes) was a battle I'll never forget. Likewise when I was riding a Strider and firing arrows into beasts I was attacking (it never even occured to me for half the game to do this), and when I was running up the hills side-by-side with a beast as we simultaneously stalked each other. These moments were AWESOME. I just wish that there were far more of them instead of so few. I longed to side straight down a mountain ala The Man From Snowy River as part of a story mission. I wanted to RIDE those majestic flying beasts. I wanted to be the one who brought down a giant dragon with an arrow to it's weak point like the warrior in The Hobbit to save a city. In other words, I just wish the game were MORE scripted.

So there you have it. This game is a one-trick pony, but it does it's trick very, VERY well. It's not the best game of the year (that's the future legend Nier:Automata), but it is definitely the new poster child for the Playstation 4, and certainly the most popular game for the console at this time. I think if you can forgive that it does not reinvent as much as polish many popular elements of game design (except for the areas I pointed out), and especially if you have not played all the games that it's stealing design elements from (especially those that did it better), you will find a lot to love about this game. As for me, I'll play this game when I get the urge to play a game like Skyrim, but want a beautiful, colorful world and strong, beautiful female protagonist (with a running commentary) instead of a dark, grey, depressing world that reminds me of winters at home...",1514851200,4

This one is far less glitch, and most problems can be traced back to my garbage internet connection then anything game side.

The major complaint I have is that you get experience instead of coins for your actions like the first game.  I feel they should have just done both......BUT, after you gain 10 levels, you upgrade the character and get 20,000 coins.  Not sure how much XP it takes to get 10 levels, but it's got to be semi comparable.  The downside is.......you can only upgrade each guy 6?? times I believe.  The positive is there are over 110 different characters you can unlock and level up, and by the time you are done leveling up the guys the game gives you by default, you'll have half the other characters unlocked.  So it's a different approach that I think could've just been made simpler by allowing characters to level up and you get coins equal to the experience you were earning, no matter where you were earning it.",1514851200,5

It has great, thematic game play, but it is a little glitch.  Some folks complain about about the online only play, but this game was released with only a $40 price tag.  Doesn't seem like much of a scam when they are shelling out the game for cheaper.",1514851200,4

3951,955,2153,"Overall works as intended. However, you must make sure that your playing space is well lit with light pointing in front of players or above players, if light source is behind the players, the zoom cannot find players correctly. We have to either remove the zoom or add a light source behind the tv pointing at the players for it to work correctly.
If you have a well lit area it will work as intended. Again, if your light source is behind the players, it will have problems finding them, light source must come from behind Zoom to light players more than background.",1514851200,5

Only thing I dislike is that there is no way to charge your controller while it's put back in it's stand. I have to carefully place the controller upside down on the controller stand to charge it with the USB wire. Other con is that the controller will fall off easily if not careful.

I have the high end component connector for the PS2 (gives me HDMI quality about 480p  i'd guess) anyhoo, it looks a little better in my opinion than the Downloaded Tekken 1 and 2 I bought off PSN Store. Next we MUST consider can you REALLY purchase another or even better fight stick on Amazon or even Ebay for THIS price and for the PS2. If so point me in that direction PLEASE. We are talking PS2 by far this is for the PRICE and Casual/Retro Gamer there HONESTLY isn't a better Fight Stick for the PRICE. We MOSTLY agree you are gonna get what you paid for. Again this is for the PS2 side of things another thing this stick CAN be Modded with Sanwa Denshi parts, keep in mind you are Modding and modding means CHANGE so yeah there's gonna be some soldering and fine tuning. This is a BASE stick not a TOURNAMENT sorry ya gonna have to spend some duckets ( I DID and this thing CAN be a BAD A** MOFO)! PS3 okay now we need to be a little bit more precise, switch out the plate to an OCTAGONAL or what ever you prefer. DONE DEAL. As far as loud clicking buttons, REALLY Dudes, UNLESS you are on PSN with the PS3 NO ONE is going to hear you MOST ppl don't speak anyway and there aren't many PS2 Headphones worth spending money on for ppl who don't speak.

FINAL COMMENT: IF you are an ALL out I gotta kill EVERYONE I play and I do this for a LIVING, this is NOT the stick for you! IF you have multiple Monitors, every NEW Gadget and it ALL Glows, Strobes and Pulsates as well as comes on with Voice NOT THE CLAPPER but VOICE Command, this is NOT the Stick for you!

About every ten seconds you will crash. You might not even know why. You hit a rock going not even boost speed and totaled your car.. again?! It's almost impossible not to crash even with practice. I stayed calm & played this for a while. Most games I get better at if I don't connect with it right away. This is on par with Mario Bros Lost Levels (Japanese Mario Bros 2) as far as difficulty.

4098,677,2198,"It has been just over 10 years since The Witcher PC game hit the scene and won the hearts of players and critics alike. The series has had two main game sequels, a card game spinoff, and some expansion/DLC packs. Playing through Witcher 3 and 2 was a delight, but is the first game as amazing as it was when it first was released? Lets find out.

How does it look?

Your first impression when starting this game is the graphics. I would say that the models/textures are somewhere between PS1 and PS2 quality. That is pretty rough considering PS3 games were delivering much more impressive character models and textures over a year earlier. (this game came out in the tail end of 2007) Now the enhanced  version looked to help clean up some of the rougher animations and textures, but I still find them to be weak overall. The graphics are so off putting to some gamers, that additional third party mods were created in order to bump the graphics up a tad more. Graphics are definitely not this games strong suit. (CON)

How does it run?

This game is not demanding at all. It requires less than 2 gigs of ram and any modern CPU and GPU will have more than enough juice to run it. Heck, you could probably get this bad boy installed on a 200$ laptop. I haven't run into any frame rate issues, freezes, crashes, or other glitches that may impair gaming experience.  (PRO)

How does it control?

This one is a little tricky to explain. It has an isometric cam angle, much like Diablo II, but it doesnt control like Diablo 2. D2 was basically a 2D game on a flat grid, but The Witcher needs to move in 3D and the camera fights you constantly. Turning around can be a real chore and sometimes it seems like my clicking on enemies doesnt register. You can control movement with ASWD and mouse (like WoW) but it isn't as smooth. If The Witcher had WoW controls and action bar, I think the experience would be much better (CON)

How much fun is it?

If you can get into the clunky controls and enjoy the narrative, you will have a pretty fun time. You will probably be more forgiving of the outdated controls and graphics if you are coming from the newer games (like me) It is nice seeing the roots of your favorite characters (Triss, Lambert, Eskel, etc) Struggling through the game to get more back story makes it worth it to me (PRO)

How much does it cost?

You can get this game for less than $10.00 out in the wild OR you can subscribe to GOGs newsletter (just need an email address) and you can get the game for FREE. Cant beat that. Free game really makes a lot of the issues feel a lot less terrible. (PRO)

Additional Thoughts?

The talent/skill tree is a little over complicated and overwhelming. Your main stats (strength, stamina, etc) have three different branches to upgrade (bronze, silver, gold) and THOSE  branches have two separate level upgrades. This is also true for sign strength, steel sword, and silver sword. The layout just doesnt work with everything spread so far apart and hidden under other menus. Back to Diablo 2, its presentation was much cleaner and easier to understand

Potions can only be taken while meditating, so no popping potions in the heat of battle like Witcher 3.

Looting enemy corpses can be a little hit or miss. Sometimes I can target the area to get their loot, sometimes I cannot

Bottom Line/Recommendation?

This game looks dated and plays dated. The story is where The Witcher series really shines. Going back to this style of game play after playing 2 and 3 is rather hard and can frustrate more casual gamers, but I think it is worth checking out just to see the roots of this great series. I would say for hardcore fans, this is a no brainer to pick up. For more casual players, I would recommend checking out some youtube videos and seeing if this game is for you.",1515369600,3

I would complain about the amount of backtracking, but you don't by a Metroid game without expecting a ton of backtracking.

Kind of a ripoff, but all my Smash discs mysteriously disappear over the years and I'm left with about $100 worth of DLC for a game I paid $60 + $40 + $30 for...and can't even use the DLC without buying another $60 disc or playing on my $40 cartridge.

There were scuff marks on the top border of the cases, but the plastic covering (plastic wrap) on the front/back of the case was brand new & shiny. It's as if these cases are actually refurbished. This fact doesn't bother me much, since they still looked great nonetheless. Just realize that you're not ordering brand new cases, but used/refurbished ones. There was also no marking on the top of the front plastic border, which was pleasant to seesince it gave the case a clean look without any labeling/lettering.

Many people would berate me for saying that but I truly feel that way. I enjoyed this game more than I anticipated I would, probably because there was so much negativity following this title.

Why the negativity? My belief is die hard fans are subconsciously discouraged due to the lack of Shepard. Don't get me wrong, I love Shepard and the series but I won't allow that to hinder future titles.

Like all Mass Effect titles, Andromeda is a story driven & action packed role playing game. Immersion is strong with this one. Theres tons of dialogue, lore, flavor, combat, skills, research/development, planets to explore, objects to scan. Combat is fluid and interesting. Graphics are great in most cases, sometimes up close it's a little distorted. Scenery and cutscenes are breathtaking. There's only 1 downside I've found, framerate decreases in few areas.

I guarantee we will all enjoy games more if we keep an open mind. Don't start a game with reservations. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't.

4170,67,2221,"I love my Senwa joystick. It's served as a justifiable & suitable replacement to the stock joystick that I purchased with another product brand. While looking around at what was available online here, I couldn't tell the difference between all of the color choices. While this colored version of the joystick seems to cost less, I needed the hardware replacementand I didn't' care what color the ball top was. Heck, I was going to replace or not use it anyway.

I'm happy to say that the choice to use Senwa has been good. There's less play in the stick while it's sitting idle in the dead zone. It contacts the micro-switches quicker when I move the stick. It also has better tension, offering a reasonable amount of feedback.

While this stick offered me a greater improvement over the stock option I had on my fight stick, I was happy to see that I can modify this joystick. I replaced the 1lb spring inside the stick with a 2lb tension spring. I was also able to replace the plastic actuator (that fits over the spring), with a 1mm oversized one... so that it contacted the micro-switches even faster when I moved the stick. This stick also allows for the inter-changeability of either a 4-way or 8-way gate for improved gameplay; You'll want to get an 8-way restrictor plate, trust me.

Whatever your gaming needs or choices, the Senwa joystick certainly offers up a dramatic improvement, and high-caliber quality in this market. I'm very new to the fighting genre overall, and I've recently purchased my very first fighting stickso seeing all of the options to modify my gear to suit my style/needs is really awesome.

I highly recommend that you purchase the 8-way octagonal gate that goes with this stick. I also highly recommend that you get a 5-pin female-to-female  harness to connect to your Encoder PCB... unless you enjoy splicing, crimping, and soldering your own wires into place.
This is a great stick, and I love that it can be 100% modified. If your stock fighting joystick feels like it's missing it's mark, the Senwa stick is a good replacement choice in my opinion. Two thumbs up!

Of course there's the remake with superior graphics, more pokemon, and better gameplay, but anyone who's ever played Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald back when they came out, will have a great nostalgia blast. Playing through Pokemon Ruby and Gen 3 graphics has that old school charm.  Also, one huge plus about playing the original version of Ruby, is the fact that legendary pokemon are not shiny locked!  So for those of you who have experienced gen 3 before gen 6 and 7, and are contemplating on buying Pokemon Ruby, this should be a no brainer, go buy it!",1515542400,5

While the 4-way gate that comes with standard issue joysticks serves it's purpose, the ability to lock-in moves with this 8-way gate makes it an essential purchase.

4185,67,187,"I'm a casual gamer. Especially when it comes to fighting games. I suppose what frustrated me personally with fighting games on the console, and PC was that it didn't feel like the arcade. I mulled around with the thought of getting a fight stick one day--checking reviews and reading about what 0players recommended. Then I came across this gem: the Mayflash F500. This was exactly the entry-level fighting stick that I was looking for. This fight stick has got me excited in my playing fighting games again! It really does make a difference what kind of controller you use.

One of the things that piqued my interest with this particular fight stick, was that reviews were saying it was designed with the casual gamer in mind. That sounded perfect for me. I'm a casual gamer, and I needed something that would get me startedand it wouldn't break my wallet. I'm happy to report that the Mayflash F500 is remarkable for my fighting game needs. It has great weight to it, thanks to a solid metal bottom. It also has a nice plexiglass protective cover (not shown on the Amazon webpage), for smooth movement of my hand/fingers over the top.

One of the attractive features of the Mayflash F500 has been it's functionality across multiple platforms too. For me at least, seeing a fight stick work on PS3, PS4, X360, XB1, Android, and PC is phenomenal! I'm mainly a PS4 gamer, and it's been working great on that console with Street Fighter V (SFV). One caveat though, a console controller needs to be plugged into a front USB port of the Mayflash F500--in order for the fight stick to work on the corresponding console. This isn't really a big deal for me personally, because I have a 6-foot USB cable, and I simply lay my PS4 controller out is the way... so it doesn't interfere with my space. It would've been nice that the port was placed in the back of the unit though, instead of the front, because I find it does get slightly in my way when I have it in my lap.

I've played with the Mayflash F500 with the stock buttons and joystick for about a week, to see if I liked them. While the buttons are responsive and work well, they can be quite loud when button mashing. Overall this isn't even a major problem, but your selections will be quite audible to you and those around you.

The joystick that comes with the Mayflash F500 is okay. This joystick isn't the most responsive one I've used, and I've found that it has a lot of play in-between the micro-switches... and wiggle room (as I like to call it). Up/Down/Left/Right definitely takes some some effort to move out of the dead zone. I've found that the distance from the dead zone to contact with the micro-switches caused delays in my fighting movements in SFV (for example); I would miss some jumps or special moves a lot. The joystick is mounted to a 4-way square gate on it's bottom, and thankfully the Mayflash F500 comes with an a replacement 8-way octagonal gate. I immediately replaced the 4-way gate with the 8-way gate in order to get a better locked-in range.

The amazing thing about this fighting stick so far has been the choice for me to mod it. After a week of playing with the fight stick with stock inputs, I was able to get an idea of what I wanted--and what I was better looking for. As a teenager growing up the 1980's I frequented public arcades whenever I could. I got used to those style of arcade machines, and their joystick movements (e.g. tension, range, feel). Thankfully there are a multitude of replacement parts available online, and I've been able to mod my Mayflash to my liking now... and I'm absolutely loving it.

I want to say that the Mayflash F500 is a fine fighting stick all on it's own. How it's built, designed, and plays is excellent. This is certainly a decent fight stick. I love it's weight, it's mod-ability, and it's overall size and feel. It's clean, neat, and compact--it doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk or lap. For anyone starting out looking for an entry-level fight stick like me, I encourage you to try the Mayflash F500 out. I think you'll be pleased with it, until you decide to double-down on a more expensive stick down the road. I know that I'm glad that I got this, and I'll be passing it down to my daughter when I finally make the jump to a $300 fight stick down the road.

==============================
Addendum:

For those wondering what I replaced the stock buttons and joystick with, I went with Sanwa Denshi. Although Amazon has some great replacement parts available here on it's website, you'll need to go to places like Arcade Shock or Focus Attack to find more variety and choices. I was able to change my ball top on the joystick with a bat top style. I was also able to find colored buttons, and I mimicked the color scheme of the PS4 controller inputs. I was also able to find sound dampeners that I could stick in each button, to quiet down my intense button mashing. The choices for customizing are endless. Have fun, and happy gaming! ",1515542400,5

The controls are on par with the the PS3 response, and the sound quality is at the same qualitative level as the graphics and game play levels.

The ipega's advantages are its media buttons and the small, nes-style dpad if you prefer that, although it's kind of this little baby-sized D-pad imo which makes it less than perfectly pleasant to use.

It has all the nostalgic charm of the original Nintendo games, without the blocky 8 bit graphics.  It is quite a challenge as well.  I had it set on easy as my 8 year old was taking turns playing with me.  I'm glad I did, because even though the levels were all pretty standard, the end was quite a difficult.  After the main boss there are two obstacle course races that took me many trys to master.  My son realized why he never finished the game as a child.  A young child may need some help with the last level, but for an adult who wants a fun nostalgic trip that still holds a challange, this game is perfect",1515974400,5

We agreed on an exchange, and though I had to clean the pins in the cartridge slot (no surprise there) the second console works perfectly. Item even shipped with an ascii controller! Very happy. Five stars for the service and ease.

Now, a bits of warning - not about this seller, but in retro consoles, in general. They're old. Expect problems and learn about them. They're time machines and need care. Finding a working SNES period is getting more and more difficult. Know how the machines work, and understand that such fragile systems can be damaged when shipped in ways we can't predict. This seller was amazing about this, and I recieved my replacement within one week. Be patient, and at least know somebody that can work on these old babies; or just check the internet for troubleshooting. Also, some SNESes I've run across are bundled with 9v power supplies. 850ma, but 9v. This will fire up Super Mario World just fine, but any cartridge with extra chips will not get the power they need to run. A SNES requires a 10v power supply. Don't argue it. Buy the right stuff for your gear. And that's it!

4397,85,2289,"I really hate the fact that there is such a mix of products on this Amazon product page. I'm only Reviewing the K51 white keyboard and I've not tried the other products that this review will be mixed up with.

This is sold as a hybrid mechanical keyboard. It feels nothing like a mechanical keyboard. There is no clickiness to it. You press the keys smoothly till they bottom out. They key caps are closer to the style you often find on mechanical keyboards, but this is a membrane keyboard through and through. Membrane keyboards are cheaper and more liquid resistent. I currently have 3 mechanical keyboards and there's no comparison. I'm not saying this is a bad keyboard--but if you want a mechanical, get a mechanical!

That being said, this is a very nice backlit keyboard. I wanted a wired keyboard for the computer the kids use in the living room and I wanted it to be backlit so it can be used when others are watching movies. I also didn't want a mechanical because I wanted a quieter keyboard. This fits all my needs and is a nice keyboard!

Also, I have three girls who LOVE the rainbow colors. You have six different options of different types of motion or two options of solid color. There is barely any customization for the six motion options except you can sometimes change whether it moves right to left or left to right. You can also always change the brightness. All of the motions are too quick for me, but the kids love them.

The two options that aren't motion are solid color all across the keyboard and one where you can program each of the six zones to different colors. I don't think programming the zones to different colors is worth it because if the keyboard is unplugged or the computer is turned off, the settings are all reset. I just use the solid color option myself.

Each key does not have it's own backlight. There are six zones from left to right across the keyboard. This doesn't really matter, but it means you can't just light up wasd or anything like that. The backlight is very bright, so having the zones doesn't cause issues unless you expect to be able to light specific keys only. The good side of that is because it's so simple you don't have software to install, and you can set it however you want with a couple of keystrokes.

The biggest downside is that it doesn't save your settings if power is lost or it's unplugged. Not only that, the default setting is a rainbow motion setting. It would be nice if the default setting was a solid color option, but all I have to do to fix it is to hit ""FN-5"". So it isn't too bad.

Overall, I like it pretty well and my kids love it. We had a pretty boring keyboard before this, but it go messed up by spills over time. I think we're going to get a good life out of this and my kids think the colors are amazing!",1516233600,4

They've also helped improve my game a lot. This is mainly due to the raised height of the thumb-sticks, allowing for a more responsive action out of the thumb-stick dead zone. I'm definitely a fan of these, and I recommend them to any serious gamer out there.",1516406400,5

I managed to beat every boss and area completely with the exception of the DLC zone Frigid Outskirts, I heard the next gen consoles fixed the issue but in that area on the 360 there is a blinding, I mean you LITERALLY CANNOT see a brick wall that your nose is touching, snowstorm that lasts for 30 seconds and then lets up for 4-5 seconds.  And in this storm there are numerous murderous unicorns that stampede out of nowhere and molest you, sometimes in pairs, nearly every minute.  Oh, and even at a full run, which you cannot maintain in this game because of stamina, it would take you a good 5 minutes or more to go from where you start to where you need to be.  So yeah, it's a cruel gauntlet of blinding death for what feels like an eternity.  But other than that one area, which is COMPLETELY optional by the way, the rest of the game was an adrenaline ride of excitement and victory, even when I died again and again.

4432,905,2077,"I bought this mouse for light weight and scroll durability. Given that it comes with the still-competitively-viable 3310 sensor, dual RGB and an ALPS scroll wheel, this mouse was a shoe-in to try at $25 bucks.

Weight: 75 grams
Length: 10.8 cm
Width: 5.8cm
Grip Width: Roughly 4.8cm

Sensor: 3310. Tracking is good and combined with the light weight, this mouse feels very responsive and ""pointable.""

Build Quality: Exceptionally solid. No rattles. UV coated plastic on the top, octogonal patterned hard plastic on the sides. Grip is serviceable, but not because of the plastic as much as the shape and light weight involved. This is a mouse that I think would take a lot of time to break.

Ergonomics: This mouse is definitely best for smaller hands and/or claw/fingertip users. It is about the size of a G203, but the front narrows down pretty rapidly to the point that it feels like the generic G203 and the diamond-shaped G303 had a baby. To hold the mouse the way it ""wants"" to be held, you have to move your hand forward according to the curvature given to the thumb/ring finger, and that makes it quite rear-heavy when picking it up. If I didn't want the rear-end to plop, I had to squeeze that little bit more. What I found out in most grip styles is that this resulted in a slightly crampy feeling that was more uncomfy than the G303, but nothing that caused pain or anything like that.

Buttons: Two thumb, two primary, middle click. There is no DPI button on top, which is a minor negative. The primary clicks are medium pressure, likely because of one-piece shell design involved. Primary clicks are good with only slight pre and post travel. As someone who rests the index./middle fingers very close to the scroll, I didn't care for the subtle comfort grooves being set so far to the outer edges. Pressing the primary keys  meant applying pressure to a small bump, a very minor thing leading to slight annoyance over time. The thumb buttons both have good tactility but have a high degree of pre and post travel, making them feel like the flimsiest part of a very sturdy product.

Scroll: Moderate resistance, good detents, moderate force for middle click with a tendency to accidentally scroll. The scroll feels really good, second only to the Roccat Kone Pure in my experience BUT. Yes, there's a BUT. Using this mouse for CSGO a lot, I use the scroll to quickscope. What I found is that a move to the next detent does noooot always correspond to a response from the mouse. On multiple occasions I would try to quickscope by flicking the mousewheel, getting the nice, tactile feedback but nothing would happen. By itself, this is not a dealbreaker, it is worth taking half a star off.

Software: The software works, but it is a con, this is another half-star deduction. It is very basic and there is no working product registration for US customers. The software also seems to be buggy. Settings don't always take when you hit apply and the program does not start sometimes - other times it will take 30 seconds to pop up. The game tracking is a pain to set up and is so basic that it really isn't worth making the effort to set up, very disappointed there. This mouse also offers adjustable polling rate, adjustable liftoff distance and stat tracking during gaming sessions. The polling rate is best set at 1000hz, I found the LOD could actually be set TOO low (less than half a DVD), to the point that simply applying more pressure on one side of the mouse would make the cursor read the ""mush"" of the mousepad.

I've tried multiple competitors in the same price range including the Logitech G203, Corsair Harpoon, MSI GM40, Technet M009. They all offer a little something different.  This one offers the lightest weight of the bunch and it is the only one I know to have an ALPS scroll wheel even though I'm not entirely sold that it will be more durable in the long run. It also has the most exotic aesthetics - some people think it looks creep, some people think it looks cool. I don't mind it. Overall, good mouse that seems very responsive and durable with minor gripes regarding ergonomics, scroll response and software.",1516492800,4

The best part is that some of my games can be played with a cross-platform save between PS4 and PSVita, which is fantastic for me. How did the Vita never catch on as well as the DS and 3DS have?

So far I've got a few games, but finding new ones that look good is turning into a bit of a chore, as it doesn't look like many devs have put any serious effort into making games for it.

Final verdict: Not the best in the series, and if you're a fan of the old Pro Skater games, you're probably not going to like it so much.

4459,4,193,"I feel like this was overall a good purchase. Despite being my first mechanical keyboard, I really wanted one with linear switches after typing on a coworker's and I also wanted one with RGB backlighting and one of good quality. I decided this looked like the best bang for the buck. It may be overkill for me since I use it at work as a software engineer rather than at home for gaming, but it feels really good to type on. I love the lack of resistance and I can tell it is made very well.

(See update regarding the following complaints.)

I only have two complaints. The wrist rest that came with it is terrible. It is way too low and I basically don't use it. The software also leaves a lot to be desired. The effects it offers are cool, but I wish it offered a little more customization. For instance, I'd love to combine the ""rainbow wave"" effect with the ""type lighting"" effect; what I picture is that when a key is pressed, it lights up white for a couple of seconds and gradually fades back to the rainbow effect. Unfortunately, the options per effect are fairly limited.

Although the software leaves something to be desired, that is not the primary reason I gave it four stars. The primary reason for giving it four stars is the wrist rest. I fee like they could include one that does not taper so much (to the point of being pointless to use) for the price.

Despite that, I love the keyboard and will be purchasing another one for my PC at home when I get a little extra cash to spend.

UPDATE: It turns out you can use more than one effect at the same time! I figured out how to have the white type lighting effect (on key press) on top of the always-on rainbow wave. It took some messing around with it to figure out it, though, and it only works with the effects in a certain order. So, while versatile, the software is still a little difficult to use.

I still don't feel like I am ""5 stars"" in love with it, but I stand by my final verdict: the keyboard is great and I will be purchasing another one.",1516579200,4

4470,570,870,"This was a free download for PS Plus subscribers late last year.  I played Metal Gear Solid for the original Playstation when I was a kid, so figured MGSV would be nostalgic.  It's a decent game, but I only got about 20 hours in before it started to lose me.  Obviously, I did not finish the story, so take my review with a grain of salt.

Pros:
--Realistic AI behavior - they switch up patrol routes, reinforce numbers if they've been attacked and communicate your position to other enemies when they notice you.  They even change tactics depending on how you play.
--Great weapon variety.  You can be a pacifist and take a silent, non-lethal approach, or invest in rocket launchers and go in guns blazing.
--""Buddy"" system is fun and you can call in help, such as air support, to help with certain situations.
--Voice acting is excellent.
--Ability to call in extraction when and where you want adds a great tactical element and makes you feel in control of the mission.  Bug out or stay and finish all optional objectives?  Try to extract directly from a hotzone now or try to make it to a more remote/safer area?
--Huge replayability to get 100% completion and all optional objectives.
--Still looks very good for a 2015 release.

Cons:
--Story is convoluted.  I know people revere Kojima's storytelling but TBH if you (like me) haven't played the other installments you will probably have no idea what is going on.  This does not have to be the case - for example Witcher 3 did a great job of telling a self-contained story that was easy for new players to follow.
--Huge learning curve and this game is downright HARD at times.  Barely anything in the way of in-game tutorials.
--There are no difficulty settings and every mission is scored based on completion time.  I felt like I needed to be pounding energy drinks to get through a mission with a passable score.
--The main villains and even some recurring enemies have supernatural powers.  This in the older games too, but I feel like it's over the top in MGSV.  Is this tactical espionage action or X-Men?
--Some of the humor seems out of place.  In an otherwise gritty narrative, it was weird to be airlifting sheep and launching enemies into the air with inflatable balloons.  IDK I guess this is part of the unique Metal Gear style.
--The open world is a nice touch but it's pretty lifeless.  Everything on the map is part of a mission objective at some point.  Why aren't there a few random villages that AREN'T overrun with enemy soldiers?

Conclusion: It's best in class for the genre, and definitely worth a playthrough.  Especially if you picked it up in the PS Plus month or at a discount.  That said, the hype is a bit overdone IMO (it was near universal GOTY in 2015) and I would have liked to see some difficulty options to make it a bit more accessible.",1516579200,3

So after leveling to 10 I start a hard core character and push the difficulty up to expert (high as you can until you practically finish the game). Found some challenge with that until I started a Witch Doctor. You can summon three dogs (that never die) and spam fire bat and walk through the whole game. So I guess the point of this game is to play the same thing over and over looking for loot, no thanks. Back to Dark Souls for me (after playing this game I bumped DS3 up a star). I highly recommend this game if you have absolutely no skill playing video games or you like taking a nap while you play (don't worry, when you wake up you will still be alive).

Weapons have that same detail.  The computer AI controlled ghost does not alloy you to be completely strategic due to them running in front of enemy when you least expect it.  The free multiplay Ghost War is awesome and will remind you of socom us navy seals.  Other dlc like narco road is not needed.  But map is largest I have ever played in gaming.

4557,1078,0,Gorilla games was know for killzone franchise.  This one was out of their comfort zone and they nailed it.  When a gaming company makes a true game we need to suport them.  All the triple A games have too many CEO's and share holders making gaming decisions. Any game that  offer loot boxes is an unfinished empty game.  Horizon Zero Dawn  is not one of those games.  My money was well spent.,1516838400,5
4558,1086,494,"I am a racing enthusiast and I was looking for a replacement for my g25 steering wheel that went belly up. I really liked the g25 and although mine died, 6+ years of heavy usage were decent enough that I considered sticking with Logitech. Im glad that I didnt. One day I saw that the Thrustmaster 300RS GT was on sale and I jumped on it. The 300RS GT is a Cadillac among beaters. 1080 degrees of motion, awesome peripherals (Yes, get the TH8A, you will not regret it.), the force feedback feels like the real deal and the movement of the wheel is extremely fluid. Some people complained about the pedals not being good enough about 5 months of heavy usage and they are awesome and just to make thing better my g25 looked like a toy, this one also looks and feel like the real deal.
Pros:
- Great range of motion
- Sturdy construction
- Bang for your buck
- Several enhancing peripherals available.
Cons:
- Not necessarily a con but the paddles rotate with the steering wheel, although some cars are like that, I prefer static paddles. Did not knock a star for it because it excels at everything and this is a preference more than a failure.
Other thoughs:
- The force feedback is very strong. If planning on running it for hours at the time I strongly recommend it dropping it to at least 50%. Running at a 100%, 20 minutes feel like an hour, if you know what I mean.",1516838400,5

I love the mold of this thing - fits my hand perfectly and I can't use any other mice now because it's just that good. No problems with the buttons at all. I actually still use the Anker at home, and the Perixx at work on a Mac. No issues on the Mac either.

4636,905,2199,"First off, I have used lots of different mice. I am a peripherals officianado. I purchased this mouse not for a high-end sensor, but as a cheap way to get a feel for this style of ergonomic mouse without going ""all in"" on a similarly-shaped $50 mouse.

I'm bothering with a ""proper"" review not because this is a mouse that is an elite piece of hardware for hardcore gaming, it's not. I'm writing this review because the mouse is an excellent overall physical (note I'm not saying aesthetic) design and a decent value overall.

If you are looking for this exact mouse shell with a competitive-grade 3360 gaming sensor, look up the Fenek Swift and thank me later :)

Ergonomics/Size: 9.5/10
This mouse curves perfectly with my hand, particularly the thumb area. I do find the rear-end is a little long for my liking, but barely so. Among the mice I own are the Logitech G403, G303, G203, G400s,G100s Roccat Kone Pure, TT Ventus R, Rival 310, Cougar 600M, MSI GM40, MSI DS100, Moto V40, Corsair Harpoon, Technet M009...This mouse is the most comfortable of them all. I use a fingertip grip while playing with a palm while browsing (medium hands). The G203 and Corsair feel pretty good while the G403 and Rival310 feel very good - but the Rival310 is actually pretty huge. The shape of this mouse has convinced my to purchase the CoolerMaster MM530, which has a virtually identical overall shape. Side grips are textured plastic and work well for me even when palms are sweaty or covered with mom's spaghetti.

Aesthetics: 4.0/10
They are what they are. The mouse doesn't look hideous, but it does look pretty cheap in my opinion. The colors clarity is fine, nothing to write home about.

Primary Buttons: 7.0 / 10
Primary clicks are not separated from the shell, the pictures are kinda deceiving. As a result, clicks are a little harder than they'd have been otherwise but both are clean and snappy with moderate resistance, similar to the Rival 310 but cleaner.

Thumb Buttons/Middle Click: 8.5/10
Both thumb buttons are out of the way but not hard to get to - positioning is perfect. Both thumb buttons have light actuation force required with good tactility and virtually no pre-travel. The rear thumb button has some post-travel, but not an issue. The buttons themselves are glossy plastic which I personally don't like, but this detracts very little. Overall, this is a <$10 mouse with some of the best thumb buttons I've tried - on par with the G403, slightly below the Rival 310. Middle click is moderate force and does not cause the scroll to move. No issues.

Scroll: 7.5 10
Light scroll resistance with fairly indistinct steps. Better for browsing than gaming but never messed me up in game.

Weight/Mousefeet: 9.0/10 (After weights removed, 4.5 before)
The mousefeet work just fine, which is to say I have zero issues with them. The mouse weighs in at just under 110g out of the box.  There are two 10 gram weights inside however. I took a hairdryer to the mouse feet and was able to carefully but easily remove the 2 rear mouse feet. There are clips at the front of the mouse, so there's no need to remove the front skate. With the weights removed, it is roughly the same weight as the wired G403 without its weight (90g) and it is able to fly around the mousepad.

Sensor: 5.5/10 ALMOST UNUSABLE FOR LOW DPI PLAYERS
Yep, this is where most of the bad news is. The mouse uses an Avago-5050 sensor. 8g, 30ips, that's it. Tracking is actually fairly decent, I can't tell it apart from a 3090 at low DPI and low tracking speeds. As an avid CS:GO player, I did have the sensor spin out about once a game on average. I continued to use this mouse for casual matches because of the excellent ergonomics. NOTE: Don't get any ideas for using this mouse competitively, I play at 800-1200 DPI on all my mice (usually 1100 with in game sense of 1.8). A palm-grip player at 400DPI would probably find this mouse unusable.

Software: NA
I couldn't get the software to work on my computer, so staying with N/A for now.

Verdict:
IF you are a relaxed palmer or a deep fingertip type with med-large hands, and IF you don't mind the looks and IF you have no aspirations of becoming a pro gamer, this mouse will do well for you.

IF you are a hardcore gamer and like what you've read, definitely look into the Fenek Swift (identical shell) and the CoolerMaster MM530.",1517184000,5

To start, I have to say that this mousepad felt right initially but wore to a point I had to get another mousepad. I spent a few dozen hours using it, and it felt amazing for that period. However, after about a month and a half into using the pad, I noticed an inconsistency in my aim and an uncomfortable feeling when I played. It felt like I had an OCD attack trying to figure out what felt off. After making sure everything was good, I decided to run my hand over the mousepad to see if the pad could be the problem. Lone behold, like my zowie g-sr, the pad felt weirdly bumpy and inconsistent across it. Unfortunately, I am unable to refund my purchase as the refund window has closed but what a waste of $25 on a seemingly good product. If you are a casual player and don't play very much, this mousepad is a good investment if you have the desk space. However, don't buy this if you expect to spend a considerable amount of time on it or are an FPS player.",1517184000,1

Long and short of it I'm not good at Mega Man games. Bear in mind the bulk of the games were on NES. Not included is 7 & 8 which I think were on PSone I believe.

I did get MM9 & 10 as downloads on PS3, I think 7-10 are going to be on the second Legacy Collection if it isn't already released.

If you like a challenge, play these games but probably on a full console so you can see it on your TV. Always colorful and beautiful games. Difficult to play.

Hopefully Konami will make a Castlevania compilation out of their 2D games library.",1517356800,3

4720,110,1278,"Instead of Dungeons and Dragons like in the first game; the South Park kids has their eyes dead set on Superheroes theme.

Like the TV show there's profanity and dark, surreal, and discriminatory humor. Instead of a wide variety of jokes (some hit-and-miss IMO) present in the South Park:The Stick of Truth; this game has a heavy focuses on fart jokes and cultural identity/race; so if you get easily offended by this then this may not be the game for you. Even the difficulty select screen has a dark racial social commentary to it.

You still play a silent protagonists, even though it directly picks off from the first game (won't spoil the ending). What's starts off as finding a missing cat, and which group of kids will dominate in making the best super hero franchise turns into something bigger that effects the whole town. Plus there's some plot twist of sorts along the way. The title is obviously a play on words if you haven't noticed, and will not click until the final act of the game

Graphics for the most part is the same from the first game, with exception of maybe more detail in the costumes and overall texture. Game does run at a solid 60fps now.

Gameplay:
You start off with 3 classes with a wide variety of super powers to choose from. This will eventually expand to more classes and abilities where you can mix-and-match

Combat is a grid based system this time around (instead of 2-sided turn based system) having some attacks, buffs and debuffs (status effects) covering a certain area of the grid. Positioning is key as some moves may have knock back features attach to them or AOE damage

There's an upgrade tree that expands once you level up. Instead of selecting individual attributes via what you wear*, you have to equip items you find or buy (in game currency) as you progress through the game.

Wearables are purely cosmetic and does not influence your stats in-game

There's also a crafting system where you combine undesirable items to better ones to use as in-game health/revives or artifacts to attach to your upgrade tree

Overall very good South Park sequel with dark social commentary, a new original story, and enhanced gameplay mechanics",1517443200,5

This was/is my first gaming keypad and I wasn't sure I was going to like it so I opted to buy the Tartarus because it was nicer than all the really cheap ones. That said I am in love with the thing, and really wish I would have opted for the Orbweaver as it has more adjustments and functionalities.

Nevertheless onto the point, this thing is fantastic. It has really streamlined my gaming experience, and has greatly improve my immersion. With it I was able to do many things at a higher level than before and that's really what I was looking for. No more fumbling around, everything is wher you want and need it ergonomically.

The software for it is also, for the most part, straight forward and works fantastic. Being able to make presets with it and switch between games easily is a dream as well. There are a few things I wish it could do that it doesn't seem to be able to do button wise; however, that could just be me and also it is personal preference so I won't take anything away from it.

4757,1024,1692,"To cover each of those points:

""The Dungeon Movement sucks."" The camera is controlled by the L and R buttons, as well as the Dpad. Attacking an enemy while moving around has a delay that feels too long. There's three camera angles of close, far away, and awkwardly-over-the-shoulder. The enemies also appear in the over-world as a weird mass of blue blocks that clashes with just about every setting in the game.

""Combat is decent."" That's a lie, this is SMT where the combat is eternally broken in your favor. Once you get demons the game becomes exponentially easier. Spoiler: that's the first five minutes of the game. Standard SMT systems for the most part, standard seven elements if you count physical, plus talking to the enemy, as is standard. Party size is lower than I'm used to for the 3DS SMT games, with only a party size of 4 active combatants at a time, as opposed to the 6 we had in Soul Hackers, or the ridiculous 12 party members at a time in the Devil Survivor games, but that actually is a good thing as it makes things feel a bit more focused, and gives a little less room to cover everything with one party, leading to strategy gaining some more importance.

""Story is standard SMT for the most part"" Multiple ending paths that involve aligning with angels, demons, or just not. Setting is interesting and seems to be related to other games, but like always nothing is concrete.

""MC's hair reminds me of Mara."" That wasn't a joke. Just look at it. It looks like Mara rolled around in brown paint and was slapped down on the MC's head. Poor guy, must have been traumatic.

If my opinions change on those first three points I'll come back to edit this, but that last point will likely never change.",1517529600,4

4767,461,2397,"Scooby Doo First Frights is a beat 'em up game that either pays homage to, or flat out steals from, the Lego games.  The formula is pretty much the same with only minor differences.  However, if you like this kind of game play, you'll probably get your couple bucks worth.

The story is that The Mystery Inc Gang are taking a vacation, and are heading to Keystone Castle for an Eating Contest, but first they have to solve other mysteries.  These take place in a High School Musical, A creepy Carnival, a spooky coastal town, before finally going to the castle.  Classic Scooby Doo fare, so fans are sure to enjoy.

As mentioned, the gameplay borrows heavily from the Lego Games.  You fight enemies, break objects to gather scooby snacks (the currency, we'll talk about what you can buy with it later) and respawn in the same spot after death.  Like the Lego Games, it lacks challenge, but what it does not lack is charm.  There are multiple levels in each episode.  Each episode includes a chase with Shaggy and Scooby, and a boss battle, after which the crook is unmasked.  The levels give hints about who it is and try to make you think.  The third level is really the only one that does, in the others it's very obvious.  Correctly guessing the crook rewards you their mask.  After each episode, the costumes you find in the levels are available for purchase.  Before you buy them, the costumes are locked to the level they were worn in.  These costumes change their attacks and non-story based dialogue, but the abilities remain the same.

Speaking of abilities, each character has their own.  Fred is the strongman who can push and pull heavy objects or turn cranks, Daphne is agile and can climb poles, Velma is smart and can operate terminals, Shaggy has a yo-yo and can grapple, and scooby is....a dog so he can use the dog doors.  Playing the level the first time, you're locked as the characters picked for you, but you can replay the levels in explore mode, and can swap out characters on the fly (save for the very first level, and any chase or boss battle) The first level is the tutorial.  It has you play as all the characters so you can see what they can do and who you like best.  It does a good job teaching you what you need to know for the journey ahead.  The game even lets you play as the enemies...once you buy them that is.  There's also five hidden costumes that are only unlockable with cheats.  Let me save you the trouble real quick.

2839 Daphne Karate Black Belt costume
4826 Fred Knight costume
1585 Scooby-Doo Egyptian costume
3726 Shaggy Native American costume
6588 Velma Pirate outfit

The only real problems I have with the game are how long it takes to spawn a character in explore mode, and how clumsy two player mode is.  Yes, this game has co op.  But there's no split screen like the newer Lego games, so you have to stay together.  Yet when playing alone, if a character gets left behind, they teleport next to you.  That aside I really enjoy the game.

For presentation, the game NAILS that Scooby Doo vibe.  Everyone looks and sounds like they should, and they even included a laugh track. The bosses all say ""And I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!"" All the classic scooby doo troupes are present and accounted for, it nearly feels like an unaired prototype Scooby Doo show in and of itself.

So that's Scooby Doo First Frights.  Is it worth your time? Well if you're looking for a challenging game, or don't like the Lego games, this won't be for you, but if you do enjoy this kind of game, or are a die hard Scooby Doo fan, you'll probably have fun with it, as it can be a nice distraction if you're bored.

4801,664,1983,"Nice to have this title back. I owned it for PSP. It doesn't fall short of value. I give it a 5 star because even the AMOUNT of good games it has makes up for the loss of the crappy few games I may not ever play again. NEO GEO is the king of there own world in games.

I need to update this to 3 star. I would do one star but I happen to like product but -

I am a collector and a player for some of these items. However I did notice a change in production. These are not the original black labels. I am sure there is more then one production(s). I can not tell you it is authentic. But there is a production in line of these titles that are missing the card slot the older games provide. Who ever did this. I am sure they have or had a license But that license isn't covering for the fact the production line is selling black labels and not authentic production line. To a collector I am offended as a player of games I do not care. As I said who ever ordered the production most likely has a license to do so or granted. But this is misleading selling black labels. You will also notice the weight of the original packing/ box is heavier then the newer and cheaper box. basicly fraud. I hope the picture helps comparing. yes, not every vender sells the same ones",1517702400,3

4886,188,1484,"Huh.  Well, I'm posting this on February 7th, 2018 and the game came out nearly ten years ago.  And it's STILL worth $60?  I don't think so.  Buy from a reputable seller here on Amazon, not new.  'Cause holy damn!  I mean, the game is good, don't get me wrong.  However, the first Fable was released way back in 2005, if I remember correctly, so we had been waiting a while for another and the sequel game looked stunning and worth the wait.  And, for the most part, it was.  I just don't see anyone paying $60 for a game that came out ten years ago if it's not some special collector's edition, which this isn't.  That's just lunacy.

Anywho, on to the actual review of the game.  Fable II is a continuation of sorts from the original Fable.  It's set in the same world, Albion, with some of the same characters hinted at, but hundreds of years later.  Oakvale, our favorite small-town home from the first game, is a shadow of what it once was and heroes have fallen into the stuff of legends.  In fact, the main city of Bowerstone is the new hub of action.  A madman named Lucien is your antagonist, ready to purge the world of its inhabitants due to the fact that he can't handle the chaos that comes with living.  Instead of offing himself like a weaker human, he attempts to destroy the whole world with magic using a foreboding magical structure called The Spire.  Ooh.  Aah.

Typical of the Fable games is the issue of choice.  The first Fable was one of the first games that kept a running record of your actions and how it affected how people viewed you.  The same stands true for its sequel.  Every action has a reaction in the world and how people view you.  Some new doodads include a faithful dog, who is often my favorite part of the game, the ability to choose your gender (restricted only to Ms and Fs, but with the ability to cross-dress in the game), and more varied quests.

I am quite blown away, even still, by the graphics of the game, so that's a plus.  The music is lulling, soft, and lovely.  Combat is very similar to the first, but features charged spells for more ouchies.  Another thing I kind of appreciate is that the game developers did away with Physical Shield from the first game.  It, literally, made you invincible and, therefore, the game became incessantly easy if you just put all your upgrades to Physical Shield.  There's less Will/Spell options in Fable II, but they are effective all the same.  The monsters/human enemies are of a decent range, but nothing to write home about. Your dog, also, is of help, attacking after enemies who are knocked down, helping you to find treasure, and being an all around goofball while you use your expressions and ""converse"" with the people of Albion.

Like most Lionhead games, the comical relief is rampant and hysterical.  The game is definitely for mature audiences for its lewd humor.  Whether it comes from listening in on drunken rambles, reading a book, watching a drunk give over his dinner to the sidewalk, or being hit on by a homosexual, the game is obviously rather liberal with its humor and makes light of the story line.  People will insult or love your appearance, run away screaming or come to gaze upon the sexiest wo/man alive.  It's just plain fun.  Your expressions are more varied and your dog chimes in once you teach him tricks and some of them are downright funny.

So what's so bad about this game?  Why give it four stars?!!! THE MASSES MUST KNOW!!

Well, I played through it twice, with the intention of playing it three times as there are three, count 'em, three options at the end of the game to choose from.  I just couldn't do it.  It got boring, fast.  Some of the BEST equipment you can only get after the completion of the game and it's, honestly, useless at that point.  All that's left is time after defeating Lucien to get some achievement points.  If that's your thing, then great, but I'm not one to put in an extra 8 hours into a game for 15 points to an achievement score that does nothing but portray how much or how little games dictate your life.  Just not my thing.  Again, it also bothers me that some of the best equipment is after the end of the game when the biggest, hardest boss is already defeated.  Why do that?  Why bother?  And so, I stole a star away from that five star option.

However, the game IS fun and IS a blast to play through and you WILL love your dog and enjoy the lewd humor if you like that sort of thing.  It's just not worth $60 ten years after its release.",1517961600,4

4891,540,464,"Great game developed by PlatinumGames. I bought DLC after I purchased disc version. If you plan to buy DLC, better to buy download version. It would be easier.

1st round (A route): 5 Star: Very enjoyable as just watching 2B is walking.
2nd round (B route): 4 Star: Less enjoyable to use 9S and almost same story.
3rd round (C route): 2 Star: Very frustrated.

DLC: 5 Star: Be aware DLC feature is only available later stage (A route or later)

Recommendation: Research some site to know.
1) Network feature seems not necessary. But without it, it seems very difficult to clear even easy mode.
2) It will erase save data by certain selection at ending. (better to back up USB or PS Plus)
3) There're some places can do auto-leveling and auto-earning.

Must learn action from early stage:

You need to try out peripherals before you buy them to make sure they fit the individual. That being said, I used this mouse for less that 24 hours before I put it back in its box and sent it back to the seller. For me and the way I use a mouse, the right button was far too sensitive and the mouse felt very light. Some people may prefer the weight, but I have always preferred a hefty, chunky mouse. I do not have big hands, but I just like the heavier mice. I noticed that anytime I went to click or double-click something I would inevitably right click. I could not stand it. Additionally, the mouse scroll-wheel is a click-by-click type of scroll wheel.

4922,297,2436,"I'm very happy with my T300, though I wish the housing wasn't quite so large. Taking off the top cover it looks like a lot of space could have been saved with a little effort on Thrustmaster's part, making the odd housing much easier to accomodate for in a dashboard build such as my own. Instead, I needed to carve my dashboard in order to fit the T300. I suppose I can't complain much on this part, but if there's onething I'd change; this is it.

The ability to swap wheels is very nice, but as I change between a circle and F1 wheel often I wish the connecting collar was metal instead of plastic. As you must insert a screw into the collar in order to secure a wheel to it, my collar's screwhole has become just a little loose; causing concern. Functionally it still works and I haven't felt that one of my wheels is going to fall off or wiggle around yet, I'm concerned for the future.

The software suite that Thrustmaster uses is one of my favorites, and I've not had a detection issue with any game I've tried as of yet. The wheel, all of its buttons and switches, the pedal inputs and the shifter are all on the same page of the suite. Comparitively, Fanatec devices require a different configuration page for each connected device which is frustrating at times. I didn't like the T3PA Pro pedals at all and opted to use Fanatec CSV3 Pedals instead. The Thrustmaster's software suite still picks up on the Fantec's inputs and shows them on the configuration page with the T300; which is very, very nice. I also use a Fanatec CSS1.5 Shifter, which also works on the Thrustmaster configuration page. Neither fanatec devices can be connected to the wheel, which isn't a complaint, but an observation; which is why I was surprsised to see them show up in Thrustmaster's software.

I've tried a Fanatec Clubsport base + wheel configuration and found the force feedback to be a bit stronger, but strangely not as smooth or precise. I'm very happy I decided to go with the Thrustmaster instead, and the ease of using other hardware with it makes me very happy. The T300 is also significantly cheaper than a Fantec wheel setup, although not quite as customizable. I'm alright with this, as I feel the majority of users won't want to change their wheels out often (or even own more than one).

All in all, I'm very happy.",1518048000,5

4994,1158,24,"I rolled my eyes at the concept of gaming peripherals, especially the Razer brand, for a long time. Never really felt like they offered anything that justified the increased price that slapping ""gaming"" or ""esports"" onto the box typically comes with. However, this mouse actually costs loss than more contemporary mice you might see at an office store without the ""gaming"" label, and has many features that will actually be beneficial to a gamer.

First thing I want to talk about is polling rate. A USB mouse will by default poll at 125hz. This means, 125 times per second, your computer is receiving movement input from your mouse about its current location, which is then used to move your cursor around on the desktop or in a game. Simple. For a 60hz display, this means that it has just over 2 inputs to look at before it has to decide where your cursor belongs on screen, and this feels nice. But for someone that has a higher refresh rate display, a traditional mouse at the default polling rate may be insufficient. I have a 144hz display that I use primarily for FPS gaming. With a standard mouse at a 125hz polling rate, this means that for 19 frames per second, an input is either duplicated, ignored, or something is interpolated (made up entirely) to decide where my cursor should go. This leads to jitter and overshoot problems depending upon how the software or your drivers decide to handle this. On the windows desktop with a suitably fast display, you can actually see the cursor jitter if you focus on its movement. No good for gamers.

This mouse offers 500hz and 1000hz polling rates in order to rectify this. While it's probably a completely unnecessary feature for someone that's still playing on a 60hz or 75hz display, this is an absolute necessity for someone with a 100hz+ monitor. Moving the cursor around finally feels as smooth as it should both in-game and for standard use in the desktop environment.

The physical design is nice. There are rubber grips on the left and right side, exactly where they should be for someone that uses a finger grip to hold and move the mouse around. They acknowledge that the mouse is not large enough to be palmed by an adult and have designed it accordingly. The silly RGB LEDs can be turned off. The materials used on the bottom of the mouse drag less than most mice, and its light size makes it easier and smoother to move around. I no longer feel like i'm fighting against my mousepad to move the mouse around.

I would definitely recommend this mouse for anyone with a high refresh rate display. While this does appear to be one of razer's 'budget' mice, they did not skimp on any of the sensors, buttons, or physical design itself. The software could use some tweaking, I'd have liked to see more options for rebinding mouse inputs, but that's not anything that can't be corrected with other free software.",1518134400,5

4998,1158,2451,"The D-pad is very stiff. As someone that's been primarily using a Wii-U Pro controller for games on my PC, this took some adjustment.

For use on the PC, this controller is pretty versatile. 'PC' mode uses xinput, which makes it compatible with titles such as Street Fighter V without the use of external programs. 'PS3' and 'PS4' engage two different dinput modes - notably, the PS3 mode lets you use the PS button as a normal button in games.

I've got some preliminary concerns about the longevity of the controller - each button individually feels fine, but some combinations of them (such as square / triangle) feel stiff in a way that implies something is catching internally, causing more wear and tear than normal. Other reviews mentioning complaints about only getting a couple months or even weeks of life out of this. But the reality of life is that no one else is really producing a fighting pad with a dpad and layout quite like this, so that's a risk you're going to have to take when buying this. Personally, it still works for me after a couple of weeks and feels pretty good to use.

Here's an update, after a year of owning the product. I didn't play much Street Fighter V after purchasing this product - just wasn't what I was looking for. However, after only a couple of months of using this controller for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite, the durability concerns were well founded - the buttons are getting harder to use over time, they're stopping just short of staying stuck pressed down. It bears resemblance to the way a controller feels if you've ever spilled something like juice or soda into it. The d-pad did loosen up with some use, and has stayed accurate this whole time - but the durability of the buttons give this controller a very 'disposable' feeling, and the price, sadly, does not match the quality. This would be fine for casual use, but if you want something that is actually going to hold up for use in a fighting game, look elsewhere.

5028,44,848,"This review is for the PS4 Version.

I have not played the previous games in the series but decided to grab this game and give it a try after the price dropped to around 20 bucks.  In some respects, this game reminds me of the GTA series with a mix of a bit of Far Cry.  I am not sure the gameplay is as smooth as the GTA5 or Far Cry, but it is pretty similar in a lot of ways.

For me, I have had a hard time getting use to the button setup as I have been playing the A/C series lately and gotten use to how to run, jump, etcwith those games.  The graphics are well done in this game as is the unique way the backstory is told.  The cut screens tend to be a bit long though and sometimes interrupt the flow of the game.

Initial install and load times tend to be long as well.  I thought I was done with the install after loading the disk only to find that there is more installing to do that takes several minutes after the title screen loads up.  Not a huge deal, but a bit annoying if you are ready to get playing.

Set in the 60s, this has a perfect soundtrack for the time the game is set in and really adds to the atmosphere. The missions are fun but do get repetitive over time.  The map doesnt seem to be packed with side missions or my least favorite thing to do in games, collectables.  The game could be a bit clearer on how it marks the objectives as well.  The game feels less open world and more linear than the GTA series.  The AI doesnt seem as smart as the GTA series.  The driving doesnt seem to be as smooth as GTA either.  No fast travel is a bit of a bummer with games these days as well.

Overall, I feel it is a solid game and worth playing for the 20 to 30 bucks price range but I don't think it matches GTA5 in overall gameplay, vast amount of missions and side quests.  I still find it enjoyable and engaging to play, even if it falls a bit short to what I have come to expect from games such as GTA and FC.

In battle, it will make your character change targets even though you don't want to and even though the one you were fighting is closer and you nearly have beaten them.  I have endured so many cheap deaths from this as to defy belief.  Also, what the heck is with not being able to skip cut scenes.  I die because of aforementioned crap cheating and then have to endure the cut scenes again and I cannot skip them?  Also a number of the powers you get do not work as well as they claim.  Whoever at Bioware approved this game for release as is should be fired and while this may sound extreme, deserves to be thrown in jail for consumer fraud.

5051,677,622,"Resident Evil is a game that introduced a lot of people to the wonders that is the PS1. I remember watching people play it when I was about 11 and it scared me to death, but I still loved watching. Now over 20 years later a lot of the scares aren't as effective and the jumps are laughable.

If you are as familiar with this game as I am, you can probably get to the guardhouse in less than an hour. Enter, RE Deadly Silence. The game offers the classic mode  which is the original game with some tweaks  and it offers the rebirth mode. This is the mode for people that have beaten the game too many times to count and know all the tricks. It is a neat addition, with some odd quarks worth mentioning.

Lets go over the pros and cons of the new game mode.

Pros
1. Many of the puzzles are changed up to utilize the DS touch screen. Some people may not enjoy this mechanic, but I thought it was rather neat. The scale puzzle in the armor room was perfectly fine and I had no problem with the phonograph puzzle preceding the second Yawn fight. Granted some are changed for the worse (see con #1)

2. In each save room there is an additional chest that can be solved with a mini puzzle and will usually give the player ammo or health items.

3. At random intervals, between door loading screens, the player will be thrust into a first person POV and have to fight enemies with the knife (stylus). It is done to some varying degree of success (see con#2) but still keeps the game fresh. If you can get through the encounter without taking damage, you usually get ammo item for your troubles.

4. Chimera is introduced WAY earlier in the game. Instead of only being in the last 10 minutes like in the original game, they are littered throughout the tunnel sections of the game. Pretty cool

Cons
1. There are two puzzles that are changed for the worst in the rebirth mode.

A) The room where you get the red jewel out of the deer trophy. In order to extinguish the light in the room, you must blow out the candles using the DS microphone. Unfortunately for me, my mic is non working, so I couldn't get the jewel and thus couldn't get the magnum  the most powerful gun in the game. Little unfair for those that might not have a properly working DS. This also affects an earlier section in the game when playing as Jill and you encounter Richard after he has been bitten by the snake. You need to blow into the mic again to perform mouth to mouth. Since my mic is broken, you have to watch him slowly die and miss out on the radio.

B) When you go into the lab and you enter the room to release the water from that area, there is a button to push. In the original game, you push the button and the water drains away. Pretty simple. Now when you push the button, the sprinkler system activates flooding the room with poisonous water. You then have to use the stylus to operate a circular lever to drain the water within allotted time. If you go too slowly, you get poisoned. Good luck finding a Blue Herb in time.

2. The first person POV battle sequences are fine for the most part, though after a while they do get a little tedious. The zombies are super easy to kill, but the hunters are a little tough and the dogs/crows are downright cheap. Hunters stand a little lower than zombies and require more accurate swipes, while the crows and dogs launch at the screen and can be a difficult to time your attack properly. It can be pretty annoying to go down a health status from these unavoidable scenarios when you have no means to heal yourself.

3. There is a MAJOR story element change in the rebirth mode that I cannot get behind. It sounds neat in theory, but if you play the game normally with the general pace of the original mode, you will be very sad and require MUCH backtracking (like me). In the original game, you leave the mansion, go to the guardhouse, go to back to the mansion, then go down the ladder in the courtyard to the underground tunnels to get the doom books to access the final area in the game. (My memory is a little hazy, but that is more or less the order)  However, in the rebirth mode you only find ONE doom book in the tunnel area. So where is the other one? Well you have to backtrack to the guardhouse and have a new POV fight with the Yawn. Then you get the second book. You would never know that. Again, kind of a neat idea, but not really excited to have another fight with the Yawn with only my knife.

Additional thoughts

1. Having the map on the second screen is extremely helpful. Makes traveling the mansion a lot easier. It also blinks according to your health status, which is equally useful.

2. Load times are nonexistent. You can watch the door open and close animation if you want, but you can easily skip them. The power of cartridge vs disc.

3. The Knife is mapped to your L button and doesnt take up inventory space. Very cool

4. Quick turn is added from RE 3.

5. It is pretty amazing that they were able to cram a complete PS1 game onto a DS cart. Even has all of the FMV, even if they are a little grainy.

Thats about it. Very faithful port of the original with a neat twist in rebirth mode. Some odd puzzle elements really keep this game from being the perfect version of RE1, but it is still fun. I would definitely recommend this to all fans. For first time players, be sure to play classic mode first.",1518393600,4

I played Dishonored 1, first (PS4 version) and fell in love with the story and game. This sequel is even better than the first. I'd definitely recommend playing the remastered original before playing this one.

Basically, this is a combination of stealth and shooter/sword play. You're allowed to play through the game as you wish, but being stealth is the most fun. This game series offers so many ways to sneak about the cities and through hidden places. It never gets old. The characters, environments and speed of the game is perfect. It doesn't take long to figure out how to level up or use the character's special abilities. The sequel allows you to play as either the male or female lead. If you play the original game, it will make more sense as to why. I don't want to give too much away in the review, but this game is well worth the purchase.",1518393600,5

5120,1157,260,It works as intended however the only downside is that you still have to point the remote towards the Xbox One so if you have something blocked it will not function at all you would have thought Microsoft learned their lesson by now they should have used the connection similar to like the Xbox One controller all you have to do is sync it so you can use it at any direction doesn't matter where at least Sony did it better by using Bluetooth come on Microsoft I know you can do better than this you have the money to do it so use it ,1518566400,4
5121,1157,418,It works as intended I am happy with it I purposely bought this to protect my PS Vita Slim when I am traveling with my book bag so that way my stuff does not crush it into pieces thumbs up for Amazon basics I will update my review if anything happens to it and I don't know why people are complaining about it doesn't fit it fit with my PS Vita Slim perfectly fine you just have to push it in from the side don't push it in with the touch screen unless you want to damage it that is entirely up to you and amazonbasics is not responsible for the PS Vita damage that is your own fault to blame so stop targeting Amazon with your problems that is all ,1518566400,5
5122,1157,217,I just received this for Christmas and it works as intended the battery can last 48 hours when it is fully charged this will actually help me increase my play time during long online gaming sessions and it does charge pretty fast within 3 hours however I did notice a design flaw there is no connection at the back end of the battery only the top front has three connections but the other side doesn't so if you slam the controller a little hard on any surface the battery will pop out and you will start getting random disconnections at first I thought the battery was already done for but I was wrong so I checked the battery compartment and there was no connection at the bottom so it cannot remain still and firmly connected so just make sure it is tightly connected all the way in and carefully put your controller down if you are not using it so that way the battery does not pop out randomly that is such a shame even the Xbox 360 battery compartment is a lot more firmly placed compared to the Xbox One controller whoever did the design of the battery compartment should be fired and pick someone else who knows exactly what they are doing  but I am still very happy and quite satisfied I just hope it will last for a very long time,1518566400,4

5133,110,104,"Let's start off with the new Battle System which is the best in the series in terms of accessibility.

The core battle system still retains the traditional one limb, one button attack functionality with spacing, air combos, parry, side steps, and timing is crucial to victory.

Added are:
-Power Crush- moves that absorb damage from a mid or a high attack, and it still continues despite taking damage. Sort of like focus attacks in SFIV

-Rage Mode. When a character is at 25% health they can do a Rage Art or Rage Drive.

Rage Arts are basically Ultimate/Super moves, and Rage Drives expand move list to where you can do lengthier combos. If you preform a Rage Art it'll cancel out the range mode regardless if you land it or not. Rage Arts can easily be block if your opponent sees it coming.

This mode makes the game more intense as there's a huge comeback factor if the opponent doesn't finish you off quickly have you hit the 25% health threshold. Both modes are be easily blocked though, so it's a risk reward mechanic.

 -Slow motion feature. The game will go into slow motion when two characters at low health attack simulatniously making the finishing attacks more cinematic

-Damage scaling: longer combos do less damage as more hits land, so skilled players cannot land a touch of death

There's no tutorial mode which is very disappointing as you have to figure the basics on your own or look up online guides.

Missing characters from the roster that tend to be mainstays are Anna, Armored King, baek, bruce, Kunimitsu, ganryu, marduk, Mokujin, Julia, roger, Lei, wang...which is somewhat disappointing. Would be great if they release them for free as DLC like Tekken 5, but seeing that there's a season pass they most likely going to be pay-to-play

Modes:
-Story Mode
There's a story mode this time around focusing on souly on Kazuya and Heihachi's rivalry starting with in infamous tossing down cliff scene we see throughout the series. Akuma (from Street Fighter) gets shoehorned in as a hitman hired by Heihachi's wife, Kazumi from beyond the grave to kill both Kazuya and Heihachi.

It's a full length story mode like Mortal Kombat where you play several character matches as you progress; instead of a character select where you get intro and ending like past past games in the series*.  The story last maybe 3-4 hours depending on your skill level/difficulty selected.
There are individual character side stories you can play through, but they amount to a text opening and a ending cinematic scene when you win one match against your rival. I actually prefer this over tagging it onto arcade mode for immediate gratification.

-Arcade Mode. Very typical a series of 5 matches leading up to a boss battle in the end.

-Treasure Mode. Is an endless fight mode where you get in-game currency and treasure chests as you win more matches. Treasure chest contains in-game currency, customization items/costumes for each character, online player icons/tags, etc. At times there will be random battle scenarios like double damage, faster speed or a boss fight

You can also unlock customization items/costumes via in-game currency also, but some costumes/items are locked via treasure mode or paid DLC. Paid DLC costumes are basically just swimsuits for individual characters.

Seeing that it's the 20th anniversary of the Tekken series, the disc contains all Tekken opening movies, TV spots/trailers, and concept art of all 9  mainline Tekken games (Tekken 1-7 + Tekken Tag Tourament 1 &2). These can also be unlocked by spending in-game currency.

-Online. Very smooth with your typical ranked, tournament and quick play modes. If you plan to play ranked there may be long queue times to start a match. Luckily the loading screen let you practice combos and moves until they match you up with someone

-Tunes/Jukebox
For those who like background music. You can select from songs from the entire series all the way back to Tekken (1).

-Paid DLC
There is paid DLC, but not to the extent of lootboxes or treasure chests in this case. The DLC in this game include Tekken Bowl, Geese Howard (from SNK's fighting series), Noctis (from Final Fantasy XV), Eliza, and the mentioned swim suit costume unlocks

-Trophies.
A platinum trophy is easy to get as most of the trophies revolve around grinding for in-game cash, doing a particular set of moves, and finishing the story on any difficulty. The most difficult trophy may be to win a tourament mode online if you're new or not good at fighting games, but with enough practice or with friend invites who let you win; a platinum trophy is not difficult to obtain.

-PS VR.
There's VR mode. But don't have PS VR so can't give you my opinion on it.

Overall, an excellent Tekken game, but may be off putting for those new to the series with no tutorial mode. Luckily there are online guides you can search for to help you out with that",1518652800,5

5146,215,2484,"Could be a good value if every game was playable without monthly fees.  Trivial Pursuit will not play with AI and you must play online so you need an account at a minimum of 5 dollars per month.
Monopoly has problems because there are no permanent settings so that you don't constantly have to click the ""skip"" button.  Rolling the dice is tedious.  The dice keep hitting the pieces on the board and take too long to roll.  Orator comments can not be turned off.  Players  can not observe the other players properties at critical times as the graphics of the opened window block everything.  Game options can not be combined so it is only possible to change one rule at a time.  You many times can't tell what the other players are doing in their turn as the graphics fly by too quickly and don't explain what's going on.

5185,1190,1263,I sold my PS3 copy because I decided I wanted to make the upgrade and get Deadpool for the PS4. Sadly Deadpool for the PS4 is more of a downgrade than an upgrade. First of all the graphics look EXACTLY the same as they do on the PS3. Secondly the frame rate drops so bad that it acts like it might freeze up. There was even a time where the sound cut out for 30 seconds to a minute. What's even more ridiculous is it would only take one simple update to fix this game but the developers seem to be too lazy and incompetent to fix their game.

5209,1066,1128,"The very first Cooking Mama game in the franchise. This game is very fun. A lot more challenging than the newer Cooking Mama games. I've had to do the same recipes multiple times to get a gold medal. It made me a bit frustrated, but none the less, I'm glad I have the game in my collection. It's still a great game, and is one on my top three favorite Mama games list. This of course wasn't my first Cooking Mama game. My first was actually Cooking Mama 4 Kitchen Magic for the 3DS. That's how I fell in love with the Cooking Mama series. Since I have all the Mama games for the 3DS. I decided to get the ones for the DS. This was the first one I picked up for the DS. Used of course, but the game came complete with case, and manuals, just the way I like my games to come, and in immaculate condition.

It had a Gamestop sticker on it from the previous owner, but was easily removed, along with a small piece of paper that was under the plastic on the edge/hinges of the case. That was also a price tag. The case as well when I opened it had a Gamestop receipt from 7/7/10. That put a smile on my face. Seeing that the seller probably only open the case to see if the game was in there, and closed it back up, not taking the time to test the game, and clean it up a bit. But that's okay with me. But testing the game to see if it works might've been a safe thing to do. Or maybe they did, who know. But anyway the previous owner paid $16.19 for the game with their Gamestop rewards card. The game was used even back then when that person purchased it and the price was $17.99. The game card came in good condition, but was a bit dirty on the back. Looks like maybe food, or something. It was removed with ease with a damp paper towel. So the little flaws that was on the case, and game card was easily removed, and I was able to restore it to it's original condition. The game also had a save file on there. That made me wonder why the person gave up their copy, and never really completed it. Maybe they got frustrated as well. Oh well. I deleted the original file on there, and started fresh. Not a big deal at all. Most used games comes with a save file on it. Not a big deal what so ever. It can be deleted. Now I'm not saying all sellers that will be selling used games on here will be just as good or even better than the one I bought the game from. But when you do research on that seller. You most likely will be happy with your purchase. I know I am.

Anyway if you're a Mama fan, and didn't start off with the first of the series, and want to like I did. I highly recommend getting yourself a copy of this game. You will really enjoy this game. It's challenging, but very tranquil at the same time. It's very family friendly, not harsh in any way. Any kid will get frustrated, and cry because the game is very challenging. Time does go much faster than the newer Cooking Mama games. But that is what makes it fun. Maybe this game is too challenging for younger kids. It could be why the Cooking Mama games became watered down over time. I like that it's more of a challenge. It makes me feel like I actually had to work my butt off to get gold in everything. But anyway. It's a good game to play with 3 other people with just one single game card via download play. It has 76 dishes, and you can also combine dishes as well.",1518825600,5

5219,677,1531,"Fire Emblem never really wowed me with its story. In my opinion, the series shines through interesting characters and the battle mechanics. The story usually involves being plopped in the middle of a war, multiple factions want to rule, and you have to murder anyone in your path. Not exactly Shakespeare. Raidant Dawn has plenty of interesting characters and the battle mechanics are very true to the series. However, there are a good amount of flaws inherent within in the game that keep it from being really good.

1. Right off the bat, before even starting the game, you are going to make a grave mistake. You will choose a difficulty setting of Normal, as you have played FE before and are pretty adept to SRPGs in general. However, based on my experience, and some internett research, the game's difficulties are a flat out lie. From what I have gathered on FE forums, gamefaqs, and other such sites, the difficulties when localized from Japan were erroneously tagged. In Japan the options are Normal, Hard, Insane. In American it is changed to Easy Normal Hard. So see how that is messed up? By selecting Normal, you are actually selecting the Hard difficulty without even knowing it. You will waste countless hours fighting the game because your EXP gain is slow and you are under leveled. Pick Easy, that is the Normal Difficultly originally.

2. There is no way to speed up or skip the enemy phase. Boy, I don't understand why this was introduced so late in the series. It is such a slog to have to watch your enemy movements and then any ally movements before you can go. A 10 minute fight could easily double in length because of all the needless time wasting.

Additional thoughts - don't pay anything over 50$ for this game. It is an ok entry in the series, but I have enjoyed the 3DS line much more.

Bottom Line - get the game if you are an absolute fan. It is a little on the expensive side, especially for something used. For newcomers, I would suggest starting at Awakenings on the 3DS and continue from there. All of the quality of life changes made to the series on the 3DS really make it hard to go back and play this game.",1518825600,3

5230,1204,2447,"This keyboard surprised me with how good it feels, i was using a K65 RGB corsair keyboard before this and im surprised by which one i prefer.
The different key's that have been added to the standard layout all work as intended and are easy enough to learn and understand, after using this keyboard to stream and play PUBG with some friends i find myself wondering if i'll ever feel like plugging my corsair keyboard back in. It's hard not to like this keyboard, the appearance may be trying a bit hard,and the scratchy plastic on parts that looks like it could come from a budget car is ok here. but i enjoy it.
The mouse included is similar to the one i already had from tecknet, although mine is bronze and has what feels like aluminum for mouse buttons painted and brushed with bronze color. back to the keyboard here, you get a dial that changes the brightness of the back lighting, you also get 3 colors to choose from being red, blue and purple ( read as pinkish), the key's all feeel very well put togethor, they aren't loud like a clacky mechanical keyboard which can be a positive or negative thing for some people, but you can tell easily when the key is activated.
really when it comes to keyboards it's how the user enjoys the feel sound and appearance of the keyboard, this one happens to also respond quickly, have some nice features and plug and play easily. everything i need a keyboard to do this one does, as a result im fighting myself on which to keep, This tecknet gryphon, or my Corsair K65 RGB....

Overall I'm impressed and would recommend to other gamers :) and before I forget..you will need a aux cable to plug into the amp shown in the pic and from the amp connect the aux cord to controller..now like I said if you want chat..you will need a coverter adapter..you can buy them for 25-30 bucks on amazon and they will ship them deals fast :)",1518912000,5

5269,314,1807,"The main problems most people face with these is that either the VMU or the controller port are very sensitive and can come out of you pull too hard. All you really need to do is jiggle your vmu and controller when putting them in and pulling them out.

For me it was the controllers port. When i noticed it was starting to come off a tiny bit when pulling out the controls plug i used my finger nails to keep it in place.

When taking out the controller plug Jiggle it a bit and it should come out a little bit. Then its gonna refuse to come out anymore. With the space given use your nail to hold the port in place and jiggle & pull a little bit more. It should be out by then but just don't pull crazy hard.",1518998400,4

5278,747,2519,"The three star review is always an awkward to make. I'll be blunt about it: It works, but not well, and not with all playstation 2 controllers.

Unless you really dig around in the answered questions, you will assume that it works with dance mats. Well you'd be wrong, as the drivers for this product only allow controllers with thirteen buttons and two joysticks to be used. This means that it will work with ps2 joystick controllers, but not dance pads. This was a huge letdown, and made the product borderline useless for my purpose.

Now because it does do what it's supposed to, I can't make this a one star review. Even if you pretend the dancemat issue doesn't exist, you would still lose stars, because it took me several days of plugging it in and unplugging it for it to finally work with me.",1518998400,3

5288,51,406,"Too many things wrong that make this game impossible to play and have fun
Cons:
later guns and armor are super expensive you would have to: (A) Grind for days or (B) Play the whole game ten times to get anything
cause the devs are idiots and made fake numbers
starting weapons and saved data of the first game of guns become a joke and do nothing for damage
Enemies have annoying autoaim/aimbot
Enemies are damage sponges and deal alot of pain
Leveling up is broken. even on new planets and hard enemies. weapons still don't level up fast enough
its a waste of my time to grind when i could do a little, get everything upgraded and move one. but no
the game is made poorly by idiots. poor and lazy check points, hard to reach areas. the two races are broken and sloppy
space battles with enemies that constantly attack you and will need to grind for crystals to power your ship. seeing the pattern here?
they should re-name this to: The Grinding Game from Hell
the camera is your enemy, its slow and stubborn
the game robs you of bolts in order to progress, gotta pay some robots 6,000 bolts, a TV 10,000 and a thief 20, 000. wow thanks game, not like things are ultra expensive, oh wait, things are super expensive.
also the ship has more colors then parts? WHY?
its so bad it gave me a headace. this game and series would be so much better if made right, but no, idiots and hacks who cant do anything good or even test the game or even knows whats fun, to them grinding painfully is fun. WRONG. its Bad and i HATE IT!",1519084800,2

This game is almost too difficult for adults to beat let alone a child, that being said if you're looking for a Toriyama Style Minecraft game that constantly resets every World (which is a good thing) you might enjoy this.

It has a compelling story which, is more than I can say about most Minecraft games and it offers replayability.

All this being said you can buy this game on the Nintendo switch now, probably for cheaper than you can for PS4 anx you should probably buy that instead.",1519344000,4

5404,855,125,"Seemed like a good game. Nice graphics, story, etc. However, about 90 minutes into the game it crashed and corrupted the save data. Even though I downloaded and installed the latest patch update I still encountered the problem. I wished I taken heed to other reviews about this problem. Don't buy this game, rent it first. You may have a better experience with this game than I have. Back to the seller it goes.",1519344000,2

5406,855,499,"Great game. This installment of the franchise has just about everything. I felt as if I was playing Assassin's Creed, COD, Metal Gear, and Uncharted all at the same time. Superb graphics and environments. Weapon/gear crafting are also a great feature. This is the only game in all of the Tomb Raider games that I actually enjoyed playing. It still contains similar puzzles as all TR games do but it is also a shooter-style game. I personally think Crystal Dynamics ""borrowed"" some of the abilities from other games. The Survival Instinct is pretty much the same as Assassin's Creed Eagle Vision, the fast travel feature is almost the same as Assassin's Creed's fast travel, although you need to be at a base camp to use it. The only major downfall to this game as well as other TR games is the map. It's a terrible design. Overall I enjoy and recommend this game and will give it another playthrough.",1519344000,4

5408,1229,843,I ordered this product Years ago as it was recommended to me by one of my best friends. It has a good story to it but I just couldn't keep up with the story in general. It just wasn't my type of game so eventually I gave it away. Thats the only game I never finished. Maybe some day Ill get back to it but Im not counting on it.,1519430400,3

5410,1231,2559,It's alright. The main problem is that the controller skin starts to shed it self literally. I think it's from sweat that's the only big problem.,1519430400,3

This game gave me major motion sickness so I had to sell it unfortunately. It seemed like a cool game but as I got to play it a bit, I just realized also that it wasn't my type of game either. I was getting slight God of War vibes from this so I thought that Id like it but nah, I was wrong lol. Still was a good experience though! And still recommend!",1519430400,3
5420,1233,1104,Good quality hard case cover the only flaw for me is that it kindda makes the device bigger and heavier in y hands. I didn't find any trouble fetting it in a hardprotection case tho.

It started peeling off maybe in the middle of last year or so. My set came with some extra pieces so just gonna change them out or most likely order a fallout 4 decal instead. Its a good product but needs work on the stickiness. I ordered Resident Evil Biohazard with this in a gaming bundle and it just so happen to also come with a controller skin and the skin from R.E is staying on longer. Its not even peeling!

5434,575,1684,"Basically the same thing as Call of Duty, but less fun and has tons of annoying little quirks about it. You constantly respawn in the middle of a gun fight or with someone already aiming in that spot. If you are using a new sniper rifle, you have to un-zoom for the person to reload (very unrealistic). And you can't adjust any guns or classes unless it's the beginning of a fight or you die. And many other dumb ideas. Call of Duty is kind of annoying to play, and this is just a joke.",1519430400,2

5439,44,386,"This review is for the PS4 game.

Although this type of game is not necessarily my favorite type to play, but I did enjoy playing the Uncharted collection that came with my PS4 and decided to get this one when it dropped in price to under 20 bucks.

Like the previous games in the series, this has some beautifully done, well detailed graphics and scenery but it is the story and good character acting that really got me involved in the previous game.  Most of my favorite characters are back and well-acted by the individuals who voice them.  Uncharted has all those things that has made this a fun series to play with its blend of action and puzzle solving.  The game is solid and plays smoothly with no major issues at least for me.  Like the previous games, the game is pretty linear (although a little less so than the previous games) and can be completed in just a few hours of game time.  With that being said there are no major surprises in terms of the different sections of the game and will feel very familiar if you have played the previous games in the series.  It is also one of those games for me that doesnt have much replay-ability as a solo player unless you missed some of the collectables.  There is a multiplayer game if you like doing that.

It is still a fun and entertaining game to play, especially if you are a fan of the series.  For me, it was worth grabbing this when it went on sale as I am enjoying the Nathans adventure.

5441,1235,14,"Pros for me: Small mobile size, good for claw grip. No wire, so less drag and no possibility of a wire getting stuck up on something, and it does not drift when i let go of it (a problem when using a low drag mouse pad with a wired mouse). Perfect tracking. In 2.4 ghz mode, I did not perceive any more or less latency compared to using a wired mouse. Able to set DPI in increments of 100 in the software, and very wide range of DPIs. No software CD included, guided me to download installer when i plugged in the USB receiver. No restart required. Software is optional, can just use plug and play, but then can't change DPI. I feel that the mouse is built well. Comes with 2 AA Energizer alkaline batteries in the box. When the connection does drop with 2.4 ghz receiver, it is only for a split second, and it recovers ""lost"" mouse movement, so you do not have to correct for the lost signal by repeating the same movements again. The new beta version of Razer Synapse that installs with this mouse is really clean and modern looking, instead of having the dated gamer aesthetic of the previous version.

Cons for me: Kind of heavy with 2 AA batteries installed, have to overcome a lot of inertia and so is actually not so good for twitchy games in my opinion (but i can adjust to this). Rubber grips on sides are ironically slippery when hands are sweaty, more slippery than the textured plastic surface on the top of the mouse. Rubber also does not have longevity, it will get pretty gross and come apart over time. Connection is not too reliable with the 2.4 ghz receiver plugged in to my desktop under my desk, but i will get an extension cable to have it closer to the mouse. Razer Synapse software is a 100+ MB download with a lengthy install, not a serious problem in this present day of computing but it just seems way too large for something so basic (but it does manage settings for many other Razer products as well, not just this mouse). Requires you to make a Razer account, then to be online and to log in from the app, just to change DPI. That's asinine.

Other thoughts: I would have liked a built in rechargable lithium ion battery instead, for less weight and to not have to manage batteries. I would have preferred a textured plastic grip instead of rubber, because the rubber is more slippery than plastic when hands are sweaty.",1519516800,4
5442,353,488,Fun game. At first I thought there were way too many drifting races but after a few upgrades and some practice it started to feel natural. I got this game really cheap in playstation store but if I knew it was so much fun i would have bought it a long time ago. Highly recommended.,1519516800,5
