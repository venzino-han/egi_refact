6860,56,141,"I did it. It took me two weeks. But I did it! And it wasn't terrible. Im being generous with 4 stars- I think 3.5 stars is probably more accurate.  This review is going to be peppered with unmarked spoilers (minor and major) because I am assuming most people who are interested have either read it already or seen the show.

The first half started out strong and I found it hard to put down.  Ive only watched season one of the show once and it was over a year ago, but from what I recall, the show stuck fairly closely to this particular book. I was able to watch it all unfolding in my head as I read and I think that helped me keep track of the outrageous number of characters, people, places, etc.

Things started to go downhill for me as the foundation was being laid for Eddards death.  Some of the things he did required some suspension of disbelief on my part. I just gave him more credit than that. I don't think hes that stupid.

The other thing that has put me off Game of Thrones for so long, is Martins methodology for shock value.  I get it. He wanted to do something different. He didn't want anyone to guess at the outcome. To be able to point a finger and say, There is noble and honorable Eddard Stark. Hes the hero so of course hell live. The problem is, when you kill all the heroes just for the sake of killing them, the reader starts to expect that no hero will live. Martin becomes predictable in this aspect. No one is safe and thus no death is all that shocking.

But I digress. This is supposed to be a review of the first book and not the series which truly I have barely started.  The writing is very good.  I enjoy the language Martin uses to evoke the feeling of a medieval time but also keeping the reader aware that this world is entirely Martins creation.

The characters are complex.  There are some youll love to hate and some you're scared to love and a shade of everything in between.  Tyrion is far and away my favorite. Hes snarky, hes clever, hes differently abled.  He isn't a hero, but he isn't really a bad guy either.  I found his relationship with Jon touching and his relationship with Bronn hysterical.  In a world filled with warriors and craven conniving councilors Tyrion manages to fall somewhere in between. He will go to battle if he must but his talents are perhaps best suited for advising.

If you love the show, I don't know that reading this really added anything.  If you're on the fence about the show, you might find the book worth reading.  If youve never seen the show, but you're interested, read the book first. It will help you keep track of all the characters (for some reason or other, most of the men all look the same to me).",1518307200,4
6861,622,438,"Definitely Dame Agatha's masterpiece, surpassing even the exquisite Murder on the Orient Express. As usual there is the clever plotting, but Christie dials up the atmosphere fashioning not just a Mystery but a Thriller. Full of tension and terror And Then There Were None almost (almost!) crosses the line into outright Horror.
One of the best Crime novels of all time.",1518307200,5

6864,700,1855,"I recently read Robinson Crusoe again and while the story was written in the 1700s, it is still fresh. Daniel Defoe did an amazing job of telling the tale of a shipwrecked man that struggled to survive while maintaining his sanity. Unlike the Robinson Crusoe movies, there was a lot more to this story and it reminded me that the rules of the open sea were much looser in days past. This was an amazing work and it was a good book to read again.",1518307200,4
6865,962,670,"This is an excellent tracing of the origins of al Qaeda from the early beginnings to the bombing of the USS Cole.  Few probably know the influence of a Muslim man, who, while in the US, saw the advances women made during WWII, and detested what he saw.  Then, switch to Egypt, where the real battle for the soul of extremism was fought.  And, aided and abetted by torture and imprisonment in Egyptian jails, the seeds were sown for hatred and the desire to overthrow signs of secularism in the Arab world.  If 'thank' is the right word, the rise of terrorism had originated in the torture jails in Egypt, where most of the leadership originated.  Shows you cannot kill an idea, only make it stronger.  Frustration over not being able to overthrow the Egyptian government caused the leadership to branch out.  From that starts the rise of Osama bin Laden, and the bombing of the embassy in Kenya, which was their first real mark on the scene. How religion was twisted to justify the killing of a Moslem, even though the Koran would be against such an action.  There is quite a bit of detail on the planning and action of the bombing of the USS Cole, and discussion as to the actual physical description of Osama bin Laden.  Reading this book allows one to sort out through the various groups that make headlines:  Hamas, al Qaeda, Taliban, etc.  This review pertains to the First Edition, so I don't know if updates were done in the paperback edition.  This book is a very valuable lesson in how terrorism is used to support an idea.  If, after reading this book you do not come away a bit unsettled, you missed the point.",1518307200,4

6867,1106,1856,This is a great handheld paperback version of the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church as first established in form by Pope John Paul II.

6869,444,801,"If you've ever wondered what Dexter would be like if it starred a female teenager instead, read this book.

Alex's sister, Anna, was raped and dismembered. The police had a suspect but he was let go due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Then one day, he turned up dead; he'd been tied to a chair and tortured, with another empty chair sitting across from him. As if someone had sat there and watched him die.

Peekay/Claire is the preacher's daughter, hence the nickname ""PK"" or ""preacher's kid."" She's tired of being the good girl, though, and all the strings that come along with that.

Jack is your typical popular white jock-type - only he's not. He wants desperately to succeed, so he doesn't end up as yet another dead-end in their small town. And he's just aware enough of his privilege and entitlement that he feels the tiniest bit of guilt

All three of these kids end up converging, and the focal point is Alex: a girl who isn't like other girls. Her sister's death left her feeling hollow inside, filled her veins with barbed wire, and she's filling that void with anger. Anger at rape jokes, at rape, at sexual assault, at double-standards, at sexism, at objectification, at male entitlement. Anger at rape culture, which says that all of these things are, if not okay, then inevitable and therefore expected. So she does what you would expect of a budding psychopath -

She does something about it.

THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES is not an easy read, for many reasons. Rape, language, violence, gore, animal abuse, drugs. If this book hasn't been banned at least once, I'd be surprised. But as with most banned books, the content in here serves a purpose. It is a grim reminder that we haven't achieved true equality yet, and that all too often, we still slut-shame and still blame the victim.

The things that Alex does are wrong, but on same base and depraved level, there is something almost satisfying about her actions, too: when we watch TV dramas and read books, we want the bad guys to be punished. And in those stories, when the judicial and law enforcement channels fail us, people take matters into their own hands. I feel like this is a microcosm, a character study, and a cautionary tale all in one: in this small town, McGinnis shows the various forms sexism and rape culture can take; she shows how humanity exists on a spectrum, and how good people do bad things, and bad people do good things, and what a lot of it comes down to is intent and frequency; and she also shows the importance of enforcing the laws and taking ownership so people don't mete out vigilante justice.

I liked this book. It was upsetting and shocking, but it also had some really important messages. Give it a read, if you're up to it. Girl-Dexter is pretty fascinating to watch.

4 out of 5 stars",1518307200,4
6870,89,271,"I know its only February 2018 but this is the best book Ive read this year.  It was one of those books, even at almost 450 pages, I wished was longer.  I found myself slowing down toward the end because I didn't want the experience to be over.  Luckily, in the authors note, Hartsuyker says there will be sequels.

Ive been an addict of the series Vikings since it began and cant wait for the sixth season to hit my front door though its main emphasis has been on the Vikings famed raiding for treasure and conquering and ruling distant lands with its warfare and fighting skills.

Half-Drowned King has some of that too but its also about Viking history, philosophy, and society structure as seen through the two main characters brother and sister Ragnvald and Svanhild.  Chapters alternate between their two adventures and viewpoints which give interesting insight between how women and men viewed life and the customs of the time.  Theirs lots of swashbuckling adventure but interpersonal relationships and alliances remain at the root of the story.  I cant wait to read anything else Hartsuyker writes on this or any other topic.",1518307200,5
6871,776,1837,"I had only finished the previous Todd novel a month ago. I enjoyed that one so much I was anxious to read this newest. This one is good but to my mind not as good as the last one.

As always, the writing is excellent. The descriptions of the English Countryside and villages make me want to go back. The descriptions of post World War 1 society are also very good. I have read every Rutledge novel that the Todds have written and am glad to see that his shell shock is improving. This case is a convoluted onefirst one man is murdered on a dark country road and soon after another man is murdered as well. What do they have in common? The answer comes three quarters of the way through the book and is a complete surprise.

There are a few minor continuity problems with the plot but they are peripheral to the main story. My main quibble is that the plot is very far fetched. I cant explain why without giving the story away. I still give the book 4 stars because the writing is so good.",1518307200,4

6881,491,1330,"This novel is a predecessor of Jiles remarkable News of the World, which I loved.  It  is set in post-Civil War west Texas, and features Britt Johnson, a black man whose wife and children have been kidnapped in an Indian raid.  The character of Captain Kidd who is the protagonist in News appears briefly in Color, while Britt in his turn plays a supporting role in News.  I wonder whether Jiles originally had one long novel in mind?

In this earlier novel the author is feeling her wa.  In addition to Britt, the novel has a second protagonist, Samuel Hammond, a Boston Quaker who takes on the post of Indian Agent for the Commanche and Kiowa tribes.  The two protagonists are meant to stand as contrasts. The black man feels his way, respecting Indian customs, working with them as much as possible in order to retrieve his family.  The white man, with the best of intentions, is blind to the traditions and culture of the Indians he is supposed to aid, and finds himself working against not only his charges but eventually his own beliefs.

Its an ambitious plan, but Jiles doesnt quite pull it off.  Britt is a fully developed character, and we are rooting for him for every step of his quest.  But when the story switches to Samuel, it seems to come to a dead halt.  Jiles has not quite made Samuel into a real person, but only an object lesson pointing out how the white mans blind conviction in his cultures superiority led to genocide.

Still, its a good read, and if you liked News of the World as well as I did, you will be glad to know more about Britt Johnson.",1518307200,4
6882,474,547,"Tavia Gilbert did not let me down. She gave me Bones better than anyone could. I love the new characters also. Of course Cat was just Cat.

To not have the one you love close at hand and just dropped out of your life is awful. But when events lead you back together things can be challenging and beautiful all at the same time.

I can't seem to get my head out of Night Huntress world. I love Cat and Bones. I love the JF put them on the path back to each other with a few obstacles int he way. It was just so fresh. I love Cat even though she was a bit hot headed, quick tempered, and sometimes did not think things through enough. Bones loved her any way. Charles and a few other new faces makes for a wonderful addition to the series. Some people find that Cat don't always need Bones to fight her battles for her. Cat was and will continue to be one great kick-azz chick.

6885,1111,561,"My first thought as I finish this book is that it was cute and I am glad I read it. But... man trying to compare this book to the first three in the selection series is really sad, even as I read them back the back. The story was just not as good. That's not even because I was a huge Hale fan, well maybe a little. It felt rushed. The love story was incomparable to anything America went through. These books were such an after thought and it came across so clearly. It was good, I read it. This was my second time reading the first three selection books, and I loved them just as much this time. As for these last two, I doubt I'll ever read them again.

The dates could have been so much better, I feel like her parents just letting her do everything was what failed here. The could have at least set up a committee to plan the selection so that she would have to go on these, proper, real dates. I fell like that would have given her change of heart a stronger back bone. Instead the dates were boring and the guys failed, no wonder she didn't find love with them. I wanted her to parents to let her select the candidates, though I can see how that would have been hard to write in. But it would have really built that connection with the guys a lot sooner. Also she didn't do anything cool and bold and outright like America did. Also I wanted her to go out of the castle and meet people and do things, why couldn't she leave the castle? Because people would through food at her again? Was that the worry?",1518393600,3
6886,237,325,"If you read SALT TO THE SEA, it would be easy to understand if you do not realize this is a young adult book. But among the many awards it has won are at least four for best YA fiction.

SALT TO THE SEA is historical fiction. It is almost the end of World War II, and the Soviets are advancing. People are fleeing the Soviets unspeakable atrocities. In this particular case, a young female nurse, a handsome young man of mystery guarding his secret pack, a woman who is almost a giant, an old man who was a shoemaker, a girl from Poland, and a little boy are all headed for the coast. They intend to board a ship that will take them to the relative safety of Germany.

6887,996,274,"Not having read anything from Earnest Hemingway for many years and watching the 1957 film version of The Sun Also Rises the other day, it was time to get a copy of the book.

I reveled in the story of a group of American and British expatriates living in France after World War I.  We see some aimlessness, love, death, emptiness, restoration, and the comparisons of femininity and masculinity.  Here are the famous scenes:  The famous Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain, the bull fights, including fishing, drinking, and bickering.

What made this an interesting novel to me was the insight into the minds and actions of the aimless and rudderless so-called Lost Generation that Gertrude Stein coined.  I believe we have a good insight into their lifestyle and thinking, particularly since Hemingway lived it. I don't think it can get any more real than that.

Hemingway is masterful at character development and making the events so real, the reader gets lost within.  I read this novel in three parts, as the novel itself has three books within.  That made for logical reading and taking breaks.

I recommend this novel, and I would read it again.",1518393600,4
6888,487,26,"This memoir was recommended to me, and when I picked it up I knew nothing about Roxane Gay. I read that Roxane, born 28 October 1974, is the daughter of prosperous Haitian immigrants to the USA. She is 63 (190.5 centimetres) tall, and at her heaviest weighed 577 pounds (261.7 kilograms). Who is this woman, and why is her story important?

I found this memoir is both about being fat, and how our experiences (particularly traumatic experiences) can shape our lives. Roxane Gay was raped as a twelve-year old. She did not tell anyone and responded by eating: I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe. While I understand that response, my heart ached for the twelve-year old girl who thought that she needed to punish herself, who thought that by being fat (and therefore less attractive) shed be less visible and therefore safe.

Theres no weight loss success story here. Success takes a different form as Ms Gay writes about her experiences, about her body and what has happened to it, and how she views it. Alongside the personal journey, Ms Gay writes about perceptions of women, about what is seen as attractive and desirable.

Why do we view the boundaries people create for themselves as challenges ?

I agree with much of what Ms Gay writes about the various forms hunger can take and the unrealistic expectations placed on so many women. Women are frequently criticised for their looks, their weight and their shape. Its logical to conclude that a womans body is her own responsibility. But what does that responsibility entail? I need to think more about that. I need to think about my own response to weight issues, about what is healthy.

Ms Gay writes that: Writing this book is the most difficult thing Ive ever done .

I can believe that. This kind of self-analysis is incredibly difficult and confronting. For me, this book is a starting point, an invitation to think. Some hunger can never really be satisfied.

6889,590,1037,"Historical fiction isn't my typical genre but we chose this one for our local book group because it sounded mysterious. And boy was it ever mysterious! It wasn't perfect but it was full of darkness and secrets that come back to haunt and those are always my favorite things to read.

Set in Amsterdam way back in 1686, 18 year old Nella arrives at her brand new husbands estate and receives a cold welcome from his sister Marin and their maid Cornelia. Otto, the manservant, is the only one who doesnt seem pissed off that shes moving in. She is set up in a lavish room and left to wait for Johannes, the husband she knows not at all. When he arrives he doesnt give her the time of day either. What is up?

Her husband who speaks in all tongues save that of love.

When I first began this book the setup felt a little Rebecca-ish with the gorgeous mansion, broody husband and creepy staff but as things went along it wasn't a Rebecca clone at all but something else entirely. Nella soon realizes that she isn't going to have the typical marriage shed been dreaming of. She keeps waiting for Johannes to show up with his rising rod of pain as her mother enticingly described it, haha, and ask her to perform her wifely duties but it doesnt happen. Shes both relieved and disappointed. Instead she settles for his companionship when she can get it and busies herself with settling into her new life. To keep his wife occupied, Johannes gifts Nella with a cabinet filled with a miniature version of their home and goes about his merry way, doing whatever it is he does. She orders some pieces for the tiny home from the local miniaturist and when they're delivered the package contains extra pieces that alarm Nella. They are pieces that only someone intimately familiar with the home would be able to create. Nella writes a scathing letter of complaint to the miniaturist and more pieces show up. Who is this person and why are they doing this?

This plot bit was the least satisfying part of the book for me. Nella sets out to investigate and surprisingly this question is never fully answered to my nosy satisfaction which was weird seeing as it was the name of the book. It kind of fizzled and died a slow death but I guess it made for a beautiful cover? Fortunately the story had enough intrigue and other goings-on that it really wasn't a big deal to me in the end.

These people have many secrets and they all come back to haunt Nellas new family. She must find strength against the most unexpected twists of fate and the utter disappointment of her new life. Im being purposely vague because I know people hate the spoilers. I hate the spoilers. Ill just say that Nella has to grow up quick and deal with some serious stuff. She does so with grace and some humorous thoughts. At least I found many of them humorous. On prickly Marin and her lack of a husband she thinks, Perhaps there was no man stout enough to take the vicious battering. That just made me laugh because it was so accurate in the moment. But don't let this fool you into thinking this is a light and airy book. It is dark, it is pretty bleak and there are several scenes that may haunt me for months.

We can do nothing we women. All we can do if were lucky is stitch up the mistakes others people make.

The characters are richly detailed and nuanced. Even the people that I disliked early on became fleshed out and believably flawed characters. They make plenty of mistakes and pay dearly for them. So although this is not my usual genre of choice, it turned out to be an engrossing and richly detailed story of secrets and little mysteries that took many unexpected turns I didn't anticipate. The women also totally steal the show and I recommend it if you like secrets and drama and can stomach some brief moments of terrible violence.",1518393600,4

6893,517,819,"Intricate and suspenseful and utterly unputdownable, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is on-par with smart, psychological thrillers that will stay with you long after you close the book for the final time.

Literary psych suspense is a sweet-spot of mine. So when THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW came on the scene, I knew I needed to get my hands on it. Granted there are other psych thrillers that may be a *little* more literary (ALL THINGS CEASE TO APPEAR by Elizabeth Brundage comes to mind), this one won't disappoint the more discerning reader but will also entertain and capture just about anyone. I found the pace fast and the writing quite good. Sparkling, in fact.

This is a debut for A.J. Finn but it doesn't read like one. THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is smooth, rich, complex, and layered. 38 year old Anna Fox is a child psychologist by training but dealing with a severe case of agoraphobia herself. I liked how she is a professional and yet she struggles, too. Alcoholism plays a role, too and so does her faulty memory. In this sense, I found the story to be slightly reminiscent of Paula Hawkins's THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. But there's more.

Anna Fox has been a prisoner of her own NYC brownstone for 10 months. She lives alone, separated from her daughter and husband. She spends her days watching neighbors outside her window, playing Chess on-line, watching old black and white thrillers, and participating in an on-line chat group for shut-ins. Yet something's not right. We learn this (and what lead to Anna's agoraphobia) about 2/3 into the story.

But there's also what Anna *thinks* she saw happen in the home near hers. Something horrific and unimaginable. But no one believes her. She's a drunk. She's delusional.

The chapters are short and punchy and I found the reading experience flew by (though the book is a bit long at 430 pages). I had theories about what was really going on and was correct about one piece of the story, but the other theory (which I thought would have been really cool), didn't quite pan out. Everyone always wants to know the ending in tales like this and if there's a twist. There is. That's all I'll say.

I also felt as thought THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW can be compared to WHITE BODIES(Jane Robins) and THE SILENT WIFE (A.S.A Harrison) as well as touches of Kimberly McCreight's RECONSTRUCTING AMELIA and EMMA IN THE NIGHT (Wendy Walker).",1518393600,5

His childhood was spent in chateaux and mansions across France, and he attended (apparently not very successfully) a series of elite boarding schools, at one of which he actually  met Adolf Hitler. Nothing much mattered to him and very little was expected of him until the spring and summer of 1940.  The Nazi invasion and conquest of France was a turning point in Robert's life as it was for so many other Frenchmen.

Seventeen year old Robert was determined to fight the Germans.  He made a hair-raising escape into Spain, then traveled to England where he was accepted for training in guerrilla warfare by the newly formed Special Operations Executive, or SOE.  Being an aristocrat helped him navigate the upper class-dominated echelons of the British espionage establishment, and he eventually returned to France, where he took part in a series of successful sabotage attacks on the German occupying forces.  It was extremely dangerous work, and he was captured several times and tortured, but he always managed to escape, often in what would now be called an Indiana Jones manner.  His activities continued past D-Day into the final days of World War II, after which he returned to private life, saying little about his experiences (though fortunately writing a memoir for his family) until his death at age 80.

Paul Kix had the assistance of Robert's memoir and the recollections of his children in writing this often enthralling history.  Besides detailing Robert's own career, Kix also gives us a very clear and horrifying picture of what life was like in France during World War II, when brave men and women joined the Resistance at the risk not only of their own lives but those of their families as well.  If, after reading The Saboteur you want to learn more about the spies and guerrillas who fought the Nazis, then I recommend Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare by Giles Milton or any of Ben Macintyre's histories, especially Agent Zigzag, Double Cross, and Rogue Heroes.",1518393600,5

She is so annoyingly hypocritical towards Cal, disgusted for lesser reasons then she is guilty. Oh he was ordered by his father to have someone freeze someone who shot good people in his home. He could have done so much worse with his power alone. And then that makes her constantly nag on him, like she has done nothing to contribute to the pain of others.

And although it bothers me that America hasn't opened up all the details of her own selection, which I think is the reason her daughter is such a snob, I'm so glad she called her out on it so quick in the book.

I just thought Cat's romance with Bones were going to come about in flash backs until my friend told me she was horrified that I skipped the first book.

Still I loved the story line and seeing Cat and Bones come together and figure out if they were going to be able to make things work. Cat's mom is kind of irritating and yet it almost becomes humorous and she sort of became that family member you love to hate.

It is sad. I really appreciate Sam because I relate. Not that I was a mean girl, it was actually my biggest goal to be friends with everyone. But I still was the type to do ridiculous things in public and I was given a lot of attention. And, my skin also goes red and splotchy when I am hot, or nervous. I had friends that others considered mean girls but I saw, I knew their imperfections and saw them stem from insecurities. While we, as a society, may raise others up on a pedestal we still are reluctant to complement them, we assume they must already know. I think those that are the most beautiful among us most of the time don't even know their individual worth. Like Juliet. Like Lindsey. That doesn't excuse the way we treat people.

6912,439,633,"It's Laura's second book, in which she writes about another year in the life of her family. They are off in their covered wagon to settle in Indian Country, because the Big Woods are now too crowded for Pa. He's lured by the promise of a treeless, level country with thick wildlife, and she describes the fertile openness and solitude of the wide prairie beautifully. Their small family unit gets along well together, savouring the little things. When Ma presses each loaf of cornbread flat for the coals, Pa says he wants no other seasoning than her hand print :) And in return, she calls the comfort of the bed and rocking chair he makes her, 'almost sinful.' Getting squares of glass for their windows is cause for a family celebration, and the girls' joy knows no bounds when they get tin cups, candy canes, little cakes and coins for Christmas.

However, Laura continues her own private quest to match the perfection of Mary. When she feels shown-up, her natural instinct is still to lash out with a slap, but she's learned that's strictly forbidden. (See Little House in the Big Woods.) She decides to muster her willpower to compete instead, but it's a losing battle, because Mary has set the bar so high. For all her good intentions, poor Laura crashes and burns at times, such as the moment she yearns for Pa to bring her a little, black-eyed papoose.

But chinks in Mary's exemplary exterior show through in this book, proving that she's only human like the rest of us. A great example is her tendency to freeze up and become helpless whenever she's scared. Poor Mary.

Heroes show up in the unlikeliest, most remote spots, including men who saved their lives outright. There's Dr Tan, the negro doctor who cured them from malaria, and Soldat du Chene, the tall, French-speaking Indian from the Osage tribe who talked thousands of others out of murdering the settlers. Pa himself always rises to the occasion, such as dragging unconscious Mr Scott from the bottom of the partially completed well. (Perhaps sinking to the occasion is more accurate in that example.) And one of my favourite heroes is Mr Edwards, the bachelor and legend who cared so much about making Christmas special for two little girls that he risked his life to swim across a raging creek to bring them presents from Santa.

But although it's another beautiful family tale, modern readers can't ignore the elephant in the room. The Ingalls family was involved in something pretty dodgy. The government had promised to clear the Indians out of their ancestral land to open it up for settlers, and Pa put up his hand to say, 'Yes please!' Arguably what he should have said was, 'No thanks, being part of something so unethical would hang heavily on my conscience for the rest of my life.'

He does come across as respectful of their culture and optimistic that they could all get along. He probably reasoned that they were all human, but that's like goldfish setting their aquarium among sharks because they're all fish, or canaries nesting among eagles because they're all birds. To imagine that two distinct communities with alien values and poles-apart cognitive habits can suddenly live side by side is a recipe for disaster. Even though Pa is careful to treat them courteously, there's always a sense that he's just waiting to be rid of them. 'Indians are always moved on,' he says. Or, 'They should have the sense to know when they're licked.'

I wonder if he ever considered how he'd feel if the Indians were given a mandate to lob in the middle of the Big Woods of Wisconsin and start pushing his extended family back. But failure to consider somebody else's former claim was characteristic of many nineteenth century settlers.

The voice of westernisation may be best expressed by their neighbour Mrs Scott. 'They won't do anything with the country themselves but roam around in it. It belongs to folks that'll farm it. That's only common sense and justice.' Even her assumption that farming is better for land over time than leaving it in its lush natural state is pure colonialism. It's easy to see why the Native Americans were incensed by this form of 'justice.'

So there's an ominous thread running through the whole story, all because the white settlers didn't 'Do unto others', although it never occurred to them that they should. The Ingalls' are living in the land of their fondest dreams, but have to put up with an Indian path running close by their house. Poor Jack the bulldog has to be permanently chained to the house, and Ma must get used to interlopers casually wandering into her home to steal whatever they please. Keeping important supplies in a padlocked cupboard is just a band-aid solution for the deeper, more sinister problem. There's always a sense that the uneasy truce won't last forever.

How frightening it was when the Indians' antagonism reached boiling point. The vulnerable Ingalls family sat in their tiny house surrounded by savage war cries, knowing full well how defenseless they'd be against a crowd of warriors bent on massacre. Six-year-old Laura remembered it like this. 'A nightmare is not so terrible as that night was. A nightmare is only a dream, and when it is worst you wake up. But this was real and Laura could not wake up.' She, Mary and Carrie would have been the most innocent victims had the worst occurred, as they were brought unwittingly to live there by the parents they trusted.

My heart ached for the terrible blow inflicted on Pa and Ma, when they were compelled to leave their nice little home with its freshly planted garden behind. For a man whose mottoes included, 'Better to be safe than sorry,' perhaps moving there in the first place wasn't one of Pa's finest ideas. But I'm sure they were well aware how lucky they were to have escaped with their lives. And their natural optimism is still shown to be firmly intact at the end.

Ma: A whole year gone, Charles.
Pa: What's a year amount to? We have all the time there is.",1518393600,4

it was amazing

The Gate Keeper
By
Charles Todd

What it's all about...

I think that this was my very first Ian Rutledge mystery. Ian is a Scotland Yard investigator recovering from a very damaging war experience. This book took place in the 1920s...there were still fires warming old English houses and cottages and cars that had to be cranked. Telephones were rare...no cell phone service? Teasing...of course. This book begins as Ian is driving away from his sisters wedding...taking a break...when he sees a woman in the middle of the road holding a dead man. Of course he cant get away from this and becomes the investigator of the case. And of course the case just gets worse and worse. More murders, family secrets and lots of interesting suspicious townspeople.

Why I wanted to read it...

I loved the cover and the description and once I read the first few pages...I was in. The writing is gorge, the plot excellent and the pace was perfect for a complex cozy mystery.

What made me truly enjoy this book...

Everything about it was delicious. Ian is so damaged that he fights his demons constantly. He is the consummate professional Scotland Yarder. Loved all of the tea that everyone drank in this book!

Why you should read it, too...

Readers who love complex cozy mysteries should love this book. The ending was a surprise...a total surprise to me and I loved that!

Thank you Edelweiss and publishers for this book!  I read and reviewed it because I wanted to!",1518480000,5
6915,612,1730,"Favorite Quotes:

It was one of those moments Gran used to call a key moment.  Time didn't simply tick past, unremarked, unnoticed.  No, this was the kind of moment that made everything stop.  You separated it from every other one, pressing the feeling to your heart, like a dried flower slipped between the pages of a beloved book.  The moment was made of something fragile and delicate, yet it possessed the power to last forever.

Memories are strange things, aren't they?  You cant touch them and hold them in your hands, but they have incredible power.

Thats the moment when everything changes.  Theres before, and then after.  And once a key moment occurs, theres no going back to before.  You make a choice, and its like ringing a bell.  You cant unring it.  A key moment is a feeling.  Your heart tells you.  The point is, you have to pay attention.

That was how love worked sometimes It filled every nook and cranny of your heart, and then one day you realized it had gone away.  She wondered where those feelings went.  Maybe they trickled into the atmosphere to be inhaled by someone else, a stranger who suddenly saw someone across the room and instantly fell I love.

My Review:

This was my first experience enjoying Ms. Wiggs amusing and dynamic storytelling and I immediately became an instant and ravenous fan.  I adored her quirky characters, clever humor, and insightful narrative.  Her storylines were poignant, entertaining, heart squeezing, intriguing, and thoughtfully written.  The descriptive detail of her food preparations played havoc with my diet plan, ultimately causing me to run to the farmers market for my own fresh ingredients from her spark of culinary creativity.  Her skillful wordcraft was a delight for all the senses and I doubt I could ever tire of feasting on her works.",1518480000,5

6917,407,1857,"Originally posted at Vampire Book Club

One hundred years ago when Earth was on the path to total destruction, along came the Leviathans, large sentient ship-like aliens, to offer aid. Now, as part of the agreement, Earth sends one hundred Honors a year to board the creatures and explore the galaxy, reporting findings that benefit both species.

After a traumatic childhood, Zara Cole chose life on the streets instead of the caged in feeling of living under Mars dome with her family. She does what she has to do to survive, but after a theft-gone-wrong Zara finds herself running back into rehabilitation for safety. When Zara is miraculously chosen as one of the Honors this year, she sees it as a great way to escape her troubles. However, even as Zara and her Leviathan, Nadim, grow closer, she realizes even the vastness of space isn't without secrets of its own.

With two powerhouse authors like Rachel Caine and Ann Aguirre I think its pretty safe to say that the writing in Honor Among Thieves is spot on. Its easy to form images in your mind while reading of what these huge sentient beings look like and to imagine them sailing through space almost like whales in the ocean. The fact that both Zara and her ship companion Beatriz are likened to being in the belly of the whale is perfectly apt and successfully backs up this notion.

Where the story gets off kilter for me is trying to bring everything into a cohesive whole. I found issue with the means in which Zara makes her way to being part of the Honors group. I felt like the buildup of her thieving and running was almost a throwaway scenario as its quickly overlooked once shes on board Nadim.

I also found fault with the fact that there are two people brought on board the Leviathans. I felt like Beatrizs character development was pushed to the wayside. She does grow, but it felt almost disjointed from scene to scene. One page the speed of the ship unsettles her and the next, shes fine. I think this boils down to the fact that the story is told almost exclusively from Zaras point of view and the fact that its Zaras connecting with Nadimnot Beatriz connecting with himthat gives the story its ultimate push.

I really enjoyed seeing the buildup of Zara and Nadims connection. It was almost like the connection itself was sentient and you could feel the way it grows from first contact to the end of this adventure. I liked the ambiguity of it. Its at once almost a childlike curiosity, yet sometimes you could feel a hint of sensuality thrown in as well, as they test the varying layers of the push-and-pull between them. Definitely one of the more unique relationships Ive read in awhile.

The fact that the Leviathan are keeping secrets from the humans is no surprise. It does drive the story forward slightly as readers wait for the ball to drop, so to speak. While the main draw of the book is establishing Zara and Nadim as a unit, I think well feel the repercussions of the secrets in subsequent sequels.

Overall, Honor Among Thieves has an interesting premise and a doubly interesting relationship. Once we move past the few rocky areas I thoroughly enjoyed this story.",1518480000,4
6918,578,1837,"Not the best entry in this series.  Weirdly enough, I thought the book before this one was one of the best.  Earlier books have been up and down as well (in my opinion).  It's possible that the two-author origins of the series are hard to manage consistently.

What is quite good about ""The Gate Keeper"" and most of its predecessors is the authors' talent from creating an interesting environment.  This is most often a gloomy, post-WWI English village.  The aftermath of the war sits heavy on the characters and on the very social structure of the place.  Sometimes this contextual framing comes off as brilliant and perfect for the police procedural and sometimes it just smothers the action.

What doesn't work so well with this novel is the overabundance of cliches (all the women are slim, fair, beautiful, elegantly dressed, intuitive, etc;.  most of the men, save for the protagonist and a couple of murder victims, are boorish, angry, quarrelsome, etc).  You could argue that there are also way too many red herrings and/or subplots that don't go anywhere and serve simply to drain away from the plot.

I've stayed away from much specific detaill to spare those readers determined to plunge on with Inspector Rutledge from spoilers, but let me add that those folks' loyalty may be tried to the limit with this one as the dour Inspector is tossed back into the PTSD doldrums with only a flicker of redemption signaled.",1518480000,3
6919,889,984,"No one really wishes to be a queen.

Oh my, I loved this. This book seems to be very polarizing on my feed, and from people I love, trust, and have similar reading tastes as, so I was a little apprehensive going in. I read that first chapter with my mouth open the entire time. Instantly drawn in, immersed, and in love.

Most of you probably know the synopsis of this book, but it will still bring me immense joy to tell those few who might not know. Basically, this story is set in a world with an amazing matriarchy, where a queen will always give birth to multiple girls. For the most part, it will be triplets, each with different powers, who will be sent away to live among people who have also developed their powers. Yet, once these sisters turn sixteen, a battle will begin which only ends when only one of the girls are alive and the other two sisters dead. This lone triplet will be the new queen of Fennbirn.

[image]

This world is gloriously feminist, and I loved each point of view from the different islands. And the writing? Beautiful, lyrical, genius. And I fell so very in love with each sister, easily, and happily. These characters are honestly a tier above almost every YA character Ive ever read. And again, this was such an amazing journey and I hope more people give this book a shot, despite the mixed reviews.

And the twists and turns? I was at the edge of my seat reading this! And I was going to say one of the only downsides while reading was because a friend sort of intentionally spoiled a twist for me, but then I was completely blindsided by another immediately after. The only reason I chose to give this four stars, instead of five, was because the actual plot itself was a little slow for my liking. This is a very character driven story, and I loved that so much, but some major plot points just felt like they took too long to get going. Even though, once they did? Lord, help me. Perfection.

In her mind, every last Queen lies at the bottom of the sea, drowned by the Goddess the moment she was done with them.

So, something I also really want to talk about is how this (in my mind and my opinion) is an own voices book. I watch a lot of Booktube, I read a lot of blogs, I spend too much time on book twitter, but I have never heard that Kendare Blake is Korean, ever. I noticed how the triplets descriptions were somewhat vague besides the dark black hair, so I went and did some searching, and I was absolutely shocked to find out that this book is written by a woman of color. I immediately went to snapchat, and all of my friends, too, did not know this. So, I just wanted to make this a point in my review, because me and so many of my friends want to support marginalized voices, and if I would have known this sooner, I wouldnt have waited to pick this book up. On top of the fact that I loved it, and it was amazing, it warms my damn heart to picture three Asian girls, trying to overcome to pressures that this world has put on them, while trying to decide their own destinies. Seriously, this meant so much to me.

Okay, Im going to do a quick breakdown of the three sisters! I found these amazing pictures from Epic Reads on my wonderful friend Mays review and I couldn't resist adding them to mine, because they are so dang adorable and perfect!

Katharine  - Gravesdrake Manor - Poisoner Queen
The poisoner queen always wins, so Katharine has a tremendous amount of pressure on her. But her body is weak and frail, from being forced to ingest so many poisons, and from the abuse she receives for not achieving her full potential. She is lonely, and scared, and somehow completely made her way into my heart. Katharine is my favorite of the three sisters.
[image]

Mirabella  - Rolanth  Elementalist Queen
The strongest of the sisters. The world already tells tales of her power. She is almost guaranteed to be the next queen, but she is constantly struggling with the idea of killing her sisters. She was raised among the people of the temple on her small, but very religious, island. She, too, has felt really lonely growing up.
[image]

Arsinoe  - Wolf Spring  Naturalist Queen
This sister for sure had the happiest upbringing, with friends and found family that actually loves her unconditionally. Sadly, she hasn't developed any of her naturalist powers, but her best friend, Jules, is one of the strongest to have ever lived. She is desperate to develop any magical affinity, and starts tampering with magic that she probably shouldnt, because this magic always comes with a price.
[image]

And even though Katharine is my favorite, I loved all three so much. And all three sisters are so beautifully morally grey, especially by the end of this story. Morally grey characters will forever by my favorites, and Kendare Blake gave me three strong, powerful, and smart ones to cry over and to root for.

Oh, and also, I told myself I wouldnt devote a paragraph to this, but here we are with unpopular opinions: I don't hate Joseph, not in the slightest. Like, did he do something he maybe shouldnt have? Yes. Is this a realistic depiction of being a sixteen-year-old whose hormones are working double time? Yes. And I think he proved numerous times that he isn't a bad guy. He does the right thing over and over, even if he is suppressing his own happiness. Also, Im always here for all the sex positive depictions. More unpopular opinion: I totally ship him with the unpopular one to ship him with. Muahahahaha!

I should think that is what anyone would wish- to be loved for themselves and not their position.

Overall, I truly loved this. I can see it being one of my all time favorite series. And I cannot wait to start One Dark Throne immediately. Also, say a prayer for me that my Target still has the signed edition that I saw a few weeks ago.

6920,382,1858,"This book broke my heart. Which was fully rude of it. But I loved it so very much, despite how broken my heart is. These fairytale retellings are the very best. And this third one was so amazing. I love how every book is a standalone, yet set in the same world around the same time. And small hints from all the other books.

This book tells the story of Javan and Sajda. It begins with Javan still at his school, where he have been at all times for the last ten years. Javan is a prince. He is doing his very best to become the best at school to honor his dead mother, and to make his father proud. And ah, Javan really is the best there. I loved that. But oh.

He also ignores just about every person in this school too, which was depressing to read about. I wanted and needed this lovely boy to have more fun. To spend time with his could-be friends. He does have one friend, though, Kellan. And I wish there was more of this boy. I do not know what happened to him. He was pretty awesome, but was only there in the beginning. Anyway. Not going to share the whole start of the book, just that Javan is still at the school, almost about to graduate and go home to his kingdom. But then he's almost murdered when he's ready to go home. Then another boy is pretending to be him, taking his carriage and things home with him. Javan survives his attempted murder, and follows the impostor. It does not go well. Ack.

The plot of this book is how Javan is trying to reveal that there is an impostor trying to steal his kingdom. But people to do believe him. His own uncle is working against him, saying that he is the impostor. And so Javan is about to be murdered again. But instead ends up in the worst prison in this kingdom. And gosh, this prison. It was all kinds of awful and I couldn't help but love every moment spent in it. Which was just about the whole book. Shudders. There is so much happening. Whole book was interesting and exciting.

While the beginning of the book is all Javan, when he arrives at the prison we start getting point of views from Sajda too. And oh, how I adored this girl. I loved reading about her so much. She has been inside this prison since she was five years old. Since she was sold as a slave to the warden. My heart simply broke for this girl. She hasn't been outside for so long. She's had to protect herself from prisoners. And from the warden woman. All that she wants is to be free. To travel far away. To know everything. Sniffs.

I simply loved getting to know Sajda. I loved how she had one friend, and older man named Tarek. He was amazing to read about. Though this one scene with him killed me. Gosh. There is also something special about Sajda. She had magic. And in an awesome way. Though the warden has placed cuffs on her arms, so her magic is very limited. Sad face. But Sajda was amazing. Brave and fierce and strong. I really enjoyed reading about her and learning about her magic. I just wish to know even more about her.

Reading about Javan spending time is this prison was pretty awful. A few people want to kill him here too, of course. Rude. But he quickly becomes sort of friends with Sajda. And I loved reading about these two getting to know each other. Eee. They were the cutest together and I shipped them so hard. I loved how she was able to help him and protect him, for the most part. Which he needed. Because this prison has an arena. And there is some type of fighting. And it was so brutal and awful and so exciting to read about.

I have already said more than I was going to about this book, yet not nearly enough at the same time. Gosh. There is just so much happening. I loved Javan and Sajda so much. There is also a point of view of the false prince, and it was the rudest. I hated this boy. So much. But I loved this story. I loved how Javan and Sajda worked together, trying to figure out how he would be able to prove he was the real prince. Their story was the best. I just wish there was even more. I want another book with them. Ack.

There are tons of reasons for why this book was amazing. The school beginning was a bit slow, but also fast to read, and it passed so quickly too. Ahh. And then the prison parts happened. And the arena. And the small romance started. And this whole book was simply perfection. And I loved it very much. So five stars for sure. Even though my heart is all kinds of broken. Because there were a lot of death in this book. Gruesome ones too. And some of them ruined me a little. But so well done. So I couldn't help but love it.

I love how the cover fits so well with the story. First, it's gorgeous. And it fits very much. The crown is for Javan. Aka the crown that he does not have at the moment. And the iron cuffs are for Sajda, that she is forced to wear at all times. Gorgeous cover, but brutal too. I must also mention the ending of this book a little bit. It's all kinds of bittersweet. A good ending, like all these lovely books, but also so heartbreaking. And also very fitting with the characters, and I loved that. Broke my heart a little, but beyond amazing.

I have so much love for all these books by C. J. Eee. She's amazing. And her books are awesome. And I simply cannot wait to read more books from this world. They are all going to be so good. Sigh. Next one will be Cinderella, and I simply can't wait. And also, I very much need the Hansel and Gretel story soon. They are in many of these books, and I love them already. Huge thank you to HarperTeen for the auto approval on Edelweiss, that made me able to read this precious book early. So happy to have read this.

6922,59,571,"Well-written, but tiresome and plodding - very slow-moving plot - and a curious last chapter - was it really necessary?",1518480000,3
6923,580,1804,"I discovered Beverly Jenkins when I watched the documentary, Love Between the Covers, and not only did I like her as a person, but I was interested in her books as they sounded good and because of something she said. Ms. Jenkins pointed out that a lot of people in the romance genre read about aliens of different colors and all other manner of beings, so why should they have any trouble reading one of her books? I thought she was absolutely right and I decided that the next chance I got, I would read one of her books. That chance came along with Tempest and Im so glad that it did. I fell in love with Tempest in the first few pages and my love for it only grew  it was a spectacular read!

Doc Lee is one fine hero and an amazing man. Hes dependable and generous and giving. You can always count on him to have your back and help someone out of the goodness of his heart. And he truly has a good heart. Colt is kind and true and it was just impossible not to fall in love with him.

I can say the same with Regan although I have to admit I loved her more than the good doctor, but trust me, youll understand why when you meet her. Regan is strong and fierce and independent. She can take care of herself, shes a boss without question, and she has a mind of her own. Regan is also kind and thoughtful and completely down to earth. She is an incredible woman and I wholeheartedly loved her!

Tempest started out with a bang and kept my interest all the way through until the very end. It made me laugh, made my heart ache at times and had injustices that angered me along with the characters. Tempest was full of passion, mystery, and sweet, heart melting moments. It was such a joy to read and I cant wait to read more from Ms. Jenkins!

Tempest is the third book in the Old West series, but it can be can be read as a standalone. Its told from Colton and Regans POV and they do get their happy ending.",1518480000,5
6924,701,1819,Great old classic,1518480000,5
6925,103,332,I enjoyed the book but it took me a long time to get into it - a very slow start.  It goes back and forth in several periods and takes a while to tie everything together.,1518480000,4
6926,554,1799,I am loving this series. Edith and Niels story this time around. When Saidth cant get a response from her friend Edith she sends her brothers to check on her. Sending Niels was the perfect gift for both Edith and Neils!,1518480000,5
6927,889,251,"Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly.

So, I wanted 2018 to be the year that I try to get back into classics! In the past, Ive found some of them daunting to read, or just too boring to ever feel invested in. But I feel like The Picture of Dorian Gray was the perfect start.

I originally was going to give this three stars, because I enjoyed it enough, but was never too invested. I felt annoyed at how these characters were so obviously not straight. I mean, a vast majority of this book is about Dorian taking a wife. Meanwhile, every man in this book just has full page monologues telling Dorian how beautiful he is. And then I sat down to do my review, and I started doing my research.

Its no secret that Oscar Wilde was a gay man. Hell, he was even jailed for his sexuality, and died soon after from all the inhumane injuries he endured while in prison. All three major male character in this book read very not straight. My friend, Destiny, told me that a lot of readers in the Horror circles make strong arguments that Dorian is in fact pansexual, which makes me happier than I can express with words. Yet, I cant help but think about parallels with this book that Wilde crafted about secret sin and how it mirrored his life and perhaps his sexuality that he ultimately died for.

You guys, I have no words. In the 1880s people thought homosexuality was some disease, something to be cured, something not okay to simply just be. Something that was a criminal act. Something that Oscar Wilde was jailed and forced to do hard labor for. And once you start seeing the similarities between Wildes life and the events that take place in this book, you will realize that like The Picture of Dorian Gray is so much more important that the surface value of just reading this story.

Okay, I do suppose I should tell you about the story now. This is a tale that centers around three men that live in an upper-class London society:

 Basil Hallward - Artist who befriends Dorian because he is obsessed with his beauty and lives his life painting many portraits of him, but more importantly, he paints the portrait that this story surrounds.

 Lord Henry Wotton - Basil's friend, which is how he meets Dorian. Henry is a manipulator that heavily influences Dorian with his views about what is important in life.

 Dorian Gray - Our main character, who starts out so young, innocent, and impressionable. He later is harboring a major secret and will stop at nothing to hide this secret and the events that lead him to this secret.

There are only two kinds of people who are fascinating - people who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing.

In this book, the value of appearance is heavily touched upon. Youth and beauty seem to be everyones priority. Its scary and sad how much this also mirrors 2018. There is also a huge discussion to be had about good versus evil and how we view that grey area in-between. Yet, these discussions are held in this seamlessly woven story.

Overall, even though I didn't five star this, I really enjoyed it and it was able to evoke a lot of emotion from me. More importantly, I recommend you all to read My dear friend Navessas review, which ended up evoking even more emotion from me. She linked this article, which then made me weep. Again, this story is so much more than a paranormal painting, and a man trying to hide secrets. This is a masterpiece and my heart will forever break thinking about this story.

Trigger/content warnings: death, murder, suicide, and a ton of misogynistic comments.",1518480000,5
6928,705,191,"Obsessed with in depth analysis of the TV series, Lost, I sought out this book, thanks to Sawyer (Josh Holloway) in the first season reading A Wrinke in Time after ""Watership down"" from a stash of books he salvaged from the plane wreckage. I can see the connection now between ""Lost"" and ""A wrinkle in Time"". Cliche as it may sound, its about good versus evil and light versus dark. Anyways,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Wrinkle-in-Time-50th-Anniversary-Commemorative-Edition-A-Wrinkle-in-Time-Quintet-Book-1/dp/B006MDW0Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Wrinkle in Time: 50th Anniversary Commemorative Edition (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet Book 1)</a>&nbsp;is a rather special novella that requires substance in the reader to perceive and enjoy the deeper meanings. To the uninitiated, the story seemed like a fantasy about 3 witches aiding ordinary folks in tesseracting (time travel or worm-holing light years across galaxies in the twinkling of an eye) in search of their long lost father. For me, it is a uniquely beautiful tale, deceptively simple but really encompasses complex themes in modern physics, ecclesiastical and socio-political governance. The evil Dark Thing (like the Dark Smoke in Lost) and IT (Giant Brain that lust for absolute mind control of the humans or any living creatures - reminded me of an episode in Futurama on the evil flying brains) on Camazotz is not fantasy for some of us but stark reminder of the evil regimes in some countries where ordinary folks are ruled by dictators or oligarchies. I myself once lived in one of these totalitarian countries where civil disobedience, creative thinking or deviation from the norm meant severe punishment and misery without recourse for justice. No I am not from North Korea nor from China. Guess again. I lived in a country ruled by the same single political party for the last 53 years, located south of Malaysia and north of Indonesia. I digressed. So returning to the book review, our three witches or guardian angels, who were billions of years old and so must have existed at the beginning of time, were (and still are) perhaps the female version (L'Engle was obviously a feminist) of the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) shining their light to show the way for the humans and what must be to fight evil, reunite the family and live happily ever after. How does one overcome darkness? To love is to be vulnerable. If Meg had heeded his father and cowered from returning to Camazotz, could she have overcome darkness to save her little brother Charles? Obviously not. Instead, powered by the vulnerability of love, she tesseracted back to Camaztoz and faced the evil Brain, rescuing her baby brother to give us the happy ending to the story.",1518480000,5
6929,271,1063,"There are a few classics of universal appeal and immediacy and power, and this is one of them. This is the kind of book that could make a kid a reader forever.",1518480000,4
6930,611,267,"Last year, The Housemate read this and couldn't stop raving about it. But because she'd borrowed it from the library, I didn't get a chance to read it then, and even when I got her a used copy for her library, I didn't avail myself of it. But I got the audiobook from the library last week, and now I wish I'd put everything else aside to read it when she first recommended it. Though everything in its own time, right?

For those who don't know, the novel is (mainly) about Marie Laure Le Blanc, a young girl who was born sighted but went blind as a pre-teen. She lives in Paris, with her father who is a locksmith at a museum of natural history, where she spends a good deal of her time, gaining an education that most children can only dream of. When the war comes, she and her father escape Paris for St. Malo, where Marie's great uncle lives in a big house near the sea.

There are other important characters, mainly Werner Pfennig, a young German boy whose mechanical and electrical aptitude makes him the perfect candidate for ferreting out resistance radio transmitters. From the very beginning, though we do not immediately see it, his path must cross Marie's.

This book is so beautiful that it broke my heart. Marie, though blind, lives in a world so rich and intense that I found myself closing my eyes as I listened to the narrator, so I could experience the things she did in much the same way. This is a fully-realized world in which everything has meaning; this is a narrative filled with the sort of detail we wish we were aware of on a day-to-day basis. This is a book where everything has its own light whether we see it or not. It's a book about connections, about what is hidden, and what comes to light. When I realized the truth of the radio broadcast Werner and his sister listened to as children, I gasped, then texted The Housemate because I had to express my shock, joy, amazement.

It's that kind of book. And it affected me in the same way my favorite books of 2017 did. When I finished, I wanted to run upstairs, grab the hardcover that I'd bought for Glinda, and start all over again, this time taking in the words with eyes instead of ears, know that the experience would be different, and the whole would become even greater, even richer. I didn't do it. I want to wait. I want to anticipate my next visit to this world.

I've seen reviews that are impatient with the book, that ask, ""Is it just me?"" Clearly not because there are a number of them. And for those who express their lack of enthusiasm with examples, it's often that they found it slow, or that there was too much that was metaphorical or symbolic. And yes, I think all that can be said to be true, so be warned. If what you want is a direct, action-oriented narrative where you don't have to think too much about what it means, then this book is NOT for you. But I loved it.",1518480000,5
6931,990,581,great book,1518480000,5
6932,1077,276,"After reading the first few chapters (The chapters are very short) of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" I wondered how anyone could be interested in such pompous, egotistical, aloof and self serving characters?

After reading on I said, ""Wow! How could I be so interested in such characters?""

Getting toward the middle of the book, I was hoping that it would never end.

By the end of the book, I fully realized what a magnificent piece of writing I had just read.

""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of the best sociological studies about early nineteen century British loyalty and society I have ever read - where title, rank, fortune, and good looks are in many ways the requirements of an approved marriage, much, much more than love. In fact, this wonderful book might not be as relevant today as two hundred years ago, but there are still many traces of such societies throughout the world, today. It was not all that long ago in America, where marrying outside of your religion, or ethnicity, was looked down upon.

The book is full of wonderful characters, but Elizabeth (Lizzy) Bennet is, in my opinion, the star. Her character is so wonderfully and fully realized that at times I felt her jumping off the page and directly into my life.

Liza, a fellow member and friend on Goodreads, informed me that she had read the book twice and still was not sure if the ending was 'sad' or 'funny.' To me, it was funny and exceptionally rewarding but sad to think that a lady's livelihood depended more on the wealth and rank of your partner than love.

Quite an amazing book.",1518480000,5
6933,1020,1859,"I proceded in caution, I was aware about the opinion many people had on trump. I saw this book on Barnes and No. and I thought, ""Well maybe he is not as bas a he seems."" I always believed that a person should look at the results instead of how the rumors made them to be.

After scanning the first page I knew for sure I got to buy it. I find out that it would be cheaper on Amazon. By now read it every day for an hour after I wake up, I consider Trump my philosopher now. There are a lot of stories here but like he said, ""...make my attitude your attitude...""

6934,243,5,"I seldom stay up past my bedtime reading anymore, but this book was the exception. It was like watching a tight green bud turn into a fragrant rose. Eleanor, who has been a ward of the state for most of her childhood in Scotland, has a boring job in a graphics firm. Shes struggled all her life with getting along with others. Reading between the lines, many of her actions are those of an autistic person. Shed very intelligent and takes things literally. She has no idea of social niceties. Her quirkiness and relationship with the IT guy at the company make for fun reading, but her actual history isn't so funny, and it slowly reveals it ugly. This book has an element that is one of my favorite characteristics of a book, well developed characters.",1518480000,5

6936,284,1275,"Another tremendous work by the master. So many story threads twisting together in a complex tale of terrorism, geopolitics, blackmail, computer games, and so much more. This author bypasses tossed-off more complete story ideas than most writers have in entire series of works. What's left is immense and grand, a world that pulls you in and spins you halfway around the globe, from off-shore China to the wilds of British Columbia. Stunning depth of detail of so many things, great characters, compelling theme, and just plain interesting as hell, despite the length. Lovely weaving of everything in this epic.
Only issue is that it could use editing to speed the start and cut about 50 pages of useless fluff, to make it tighter and better.",1518480000,5
6937,248,1860,"I'll be honest- I didn't like the first book in this series but I didn't realize that till I sat down to write this review and saw my comments on that one.  What a difference this made.  No spoilers but it seems to me that Winslow has upped her game by writing a book filled with secrets, lies, and I'm not quite sure how to describe it.  Who was Annalise and who is actually buried in her grave?  And, what happened to Annalise?  Advancements in how DNA can be used is the starting point for a good mystery.  Morris Keene and Chloe Frohmann are on the case.  These two have a history - some of which I missed but that was OK.  There's good interplay between them.  This is in many ways your basic procedural but there are some nifty twists.  It's a good read.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC (and for reintroducing me to Winslow's work.).",1518480000,4

6939,203,367,"The stages of Polly's life cycle from little girl holding her teddy bear to a monster wearing little girl skin.
This was cruel, brutal, violent, sad, disturbing, dark journey through hell with Nate McClusky and his daughter Polly.
Just before getting out of jail Nate was made an offer by the prison gang Aryan Steel that he couldn't refuse but he did. Setting off a violent chase to save his daughter Polly, marked for death for his betrayal.

Polly was a young butterfly whose wings were still wet. In a short time her wings grew strong with sharp razor tips that could slice through aryan steel.

This was a well written fast paced book that read like a movie script.
Reminded me of the movie 'The Professional' starring Natalie Portman as an 11 year old on the run with an assassin, Jean Reno, who teaches her how to fight and shoot guns.

This will make a very good, dark, gritty, and at times heart wrenching movie.
Well done.

6940,414,1860,"Once again I find myself reading a book without having read the previous books in the series. Look for Herby Emily Winslow is the fourth book in the Keene and Frohman series and promises to be a gripping, psychological thriller about a legendary missing girl. I love me a good thriller and was hoping that, even without the backstory, this would be a rich read.

I did miss knowing the history between Keene and Frohman, who in this installment, have had a falling out and are walking on eggshells around each other. However, I don't think jumping in at this point had a huge impact on this story. This was a different case that was quite interesting to me, told from varying points of view, with a focus on different characters. Some chapters are transcriptions of therapy sessions, other chapters revolve around the patients in real life, as well as the therapist, all with a common thread from the past tying it together.

I found this format really interesting, especially the session transcriptions, because the narrative is so raw and unreliable, speaking in a way people just don't speak in regular conversations. But the fact that these people were unreliable, I found facts started overlapping a bit and everyone being obsessed with the same case started to all blend together and confuse the independence of some of the characters. Not to mention a lot of people had the same or similar names. I didn't feel like anything was strong enough on its own to fully stand out and the story felt a little muddled and confusing at times.

The detectives seemed very much like secondary characters to me, which could be because its a fourth book in the series and I had no other knowledge of them, but I felt like their part in all this didn't really matter until the end when they swooped in and put all the pieces together. The chapters from their perspectives didn't really do anything to help solve the case and I was far more invested in Lauren Ambrose and her clients than anything else. That might have been different had I developed a fondness for the detectives throughout the series, but I still feel like they were completely underused here.

There were some parts of this that I really didn't like, parts that I felt were more like tools to fill in the blanks as opposed to a clever and natural flow of the story and things I felt that could have been handled differently to make the narrative stronger. Those parts bothered me a lot. But overall, I liked the twist in the end as the case comes together and I didn't feel let down with the resolve.

6942,275,1860,"Look for Her by Emily Winslow is a baffling mystery about a decades old murder that has yet to be solved. Although this newest release is the  fourth installment in the Keene and Frohmann series, it can be read as a standalone.

Morris Keene is now a civilian working in the cold case squad and his current case involves a recent DNA match in the long unsolved murder of teenager Annalise Wood. In 1986, Annalise disappeared on her way home from school but her skeletonzied remains were not discovered until 1992.  Advances in DNA testing reveal a match for a stain found on her skirt and Morris asks his former partner, DI Chloe Frohmann, who is currently on maternity leave, to accompany him as he interviews the suspect.  Although their relationship has been a little strained due to a previous case, the two still work well together.

At the same time as the Annalise investigation is finding new life, therapist Dr. Laurie Ambrose encounters two patients who have mentioned the missing young woman. One clients obsession is due to the fact her mother knew Annalise when they were kids. Her other client has recently learned about a possible connection to Annalise. Laurie is stunned to learn that one of these two women has recently died and her death might be the result of foul play.

The two story arcs unexpectedly converge following the death of Lauries patient. Morris is still trying to figure out the implications of the information revealed during his meeting with the new suspect in Annalises murder. His investigation leads to a very unexpected conclusion which coincides with the suspicious death of Lauries patient.  At this point, Morris ends up working with a Detective Sergeant with whom he shares a tangled history but he puts aside his animosity long enough for them to make significant progress on the recent death. Morris then turns his attention back to Annalises case where he makes an absolutely astonishing discovery.

Look for Her is a twist-filled police procedural that is intricately-plotted and well executed.  Morris and Chloe are fantastic protagonists whose history is complex and quite interesting. The two story arcs intertwine in a unexpected, but completely believable manner.  Although the pacing is a little slow initially, it eventually hits its stride once the connection between Lauries patients and Morris and Chloes cold case investigation is revealed. Emily Winslow brings the novel to a stunning, but completely satisfying, conclusion. This newest addition to the Keene and Frohmann series is a clever mystery that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy.

6943,686,1802,"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.

This is not your typical love story. I enjoyed the intrigue, ghosts, family infighting and dissension. The way the characters are written makes you want more, especially interaction between the brothers. There's a story there that the reader only gets a glimpse of.

A well known family has its secrets and does its best to protect those they love, and in doing so, often color outside the lines.

The romance between Julia and Lucian starts off rocky, with Julia having difficulty imagining a relationship with a man who seems to have little to no ambition. Lucian knows that there is something about Julia that calls to him, to open his closed heart to a love.

Julia knows that any relationship that she has with Lucian will be second to him protecting his brothers and his twin sister. He's willing to do anything to make sure his sister has the best care necessary and makes a full recovery. Julia wants the same thing but has a feeling that there is more to his sister's condition that meets the eye.

I enjoyed this story, the way the characters were written and can't wait to read the next story in the series.

6961,983,284,"I suppose it's customary to announce, right here at the outset (as do many Neil Gaiman devotees), as more or less a confession of faith, that I'm fairly well in the tank for Neil Gaiman in all his manifold guiuses--comics writer, novelist, collaborator, story writer, children's book author, and audiobook narrator. Have I missed anything? Editor, I suppose--I havedn't read any of the various story collections he's edited and introduced. He is a modern Master of Story.

We know, if only from American Gods, Anansi Boys, and the Sandman comics, that Gaiman is steeped in the great mythologies, and his most recent book, Norse Mythology--a publisher's commission that was some four years in gestation and writing--is part of the upshot of that steeping, which began in single-digit early age. I'm also happy to add that Gaiman and I (and millions of others) adored Marvel's Thor comics, from the God of Thunder and Lightning's very outset in Journey Into Mystery #83 of August 1962 onward through, oh, 1968, when I got drafted and set side my comic-book days (until much later, when I entered the Frank Miller-Daniel Clowes-Alan Moore-Neil Gaiman- Universe). Gaiman drew on translations of the Prose and Poetic Eddas, the medieval Icelandic sources of the mythological Norse stories, as well as his memories of beloved books like Roger Lancelyn Green's Myths of the Norsemen (which Gaiman claims NOT to have reread as a source). (My own beloved folio-size picture book, D'Aulaires' ubiquitous Norse Gods and Giants, received--to my surprise--no mention.)

Gaiman has turned the best known of the mythological stories into thoroughly colloquial modern English and woven from them the arc of a continuous, beautifully told story, from the Norse creation myths, the origins of the nine worlds, and their inhabitants to the tales of Odin, Thor, and their families in seemingly perpetual contention with trickster and fire god Loki and his offspring. Our entire pantheon of gods--along with the Giants and the Great Midgard (World) Serpent Jrmungandr and the giant wolf-child of Loki, Fenrir and all the inhabitants of the Nine Worlds--wind up, as they must, at Ragnarok, the time of the death of the Gods, which Gaiman casts as a tale of future past, events impending but not yet happened...and yet all foretold and worked out in a thrilling Armegeddon.

Gripped afresh by Gaiman's felicitous retellings, I read this book in a single, long gulp (I'm a very slow reader). In my judgment, it is suitable for all ages. Gaiman doesn't condescend, doesn't talk down to the reader, doesn't overexplain the unfathomable motives of the loving, passionate, yes, lusty, manipulative, cruel, deceiving...very humanized...gods, but parents looking for bedtime reading material for their tots should be prepared to edit on the fly (which was my technique when reading to my own now fully grown children). This is a book filled with gruesome deeds, tellings of tortures and slaughter--Gaiman is especially imaginative in this subset of his art--which authenticate the warlike culture from which the sources spring, but the stories also celebrate the domesticity of home in the marriages and families of the gods and giants, however faithless they may sometimes be.

In all, in my view, a lovely book, perfect for this generation of readers of every age, by one of our most gifted storytellers.",1518566400,5

6963,608,1862,"Girl Power!  I think every girl needs to read this childrens book.  What an uplifting and wonderful novel celebrating us females!  I cant begin to express how enlightening and empowering this novel is.  I am definitely going to be buying a few copies of this novel and sharing them.

This novel is basically made up of an assortment of two-page spread entries which begin with Dear Girl, and tell the female reader that they are okay, they are special, they are unique and loved.  My heart was bursting after my first reading.  I immediately had to reread it as it hit on so many different strings that girls address as they are growing up, that now, on my second time through, I stopped and really enjoyed each and every page of the novel.  Girls, its okay to cry, its okay to be alone, its okay to ask all kinds of questions, to say no and its okay to dress different.  I loved the illustration of the girl; her simple style went well with the novel.  I enjoyed the illustrations and I liked how they didn't overtake the novels objective.

I really liked the pages that said, Dear Girl, You won't be invited to every single party on the planet.  (Which is really okay- can you image how exhausting that would be?).  This page hit home with me, this page covers many topics that individuals face with growing up.  I cant tell you how many times as a substitute teacher I have had to deal with issues of girls not being accepted by their peers. It hurts to see this happen but like the other pages in this novel, it tells girls that it is okay.  This novel tells girls that it is also okay to find people that are different, people that are not like them.  As a parent, these pages speak volumes.  This is a wonderful, fantastic childrens book!  I highly recommend checking it out and perhaps buying a few copies: one for your own child, one for your teacher or giving one away as we all know, we should empower others.",1518566400,5
6964,716,1838,"Brienna has never known who her father is, only that he is from neighboring Maevana. When her grandfather takes her to Magnalia House and has her accepted as a student of passion, Brienna discovers a new home. Among the handful of other students, Brienna discovers sisters as well as her own interest in history. As Brienna gets ready to master her passion for knowledge and leave Magnalia House, her plans go awry and she doesnt complete the graduation ceremony and find a patron. Instead, her flashbacks of memories from a mysterious ancestor tie her closely to those who would restore a queen to the throne of Maevana and dethrone the imposter king. As war brews, Brienna becomes the linchpin to a plan that takes her into the heart of her homeland of Maevana and the dangers of political intrigue generations in the making.

Ross has deftly woven a story set in medieval times with glimpses of magic. Her story is firmly feminist, calling for queens to sit on thrones, the power of magic in womens hands, and the ability of women to create plans that are daring and effective. The world created here is tightly drawn, two neighboring nations with differences in cultures that come together in Brienna. Ross also incorporates the fall of a queen and the resulting ramifications of her loss. Its beautifully drawn, some of it revealed only towards the end of the novel to complete the picture.

Brienna is an incredible protagonist. She is humble and yet clearly bright and gifted, just with different gifts than the school for passion may be looking for. Her ability to plot and plan, learn to use a sword, and adjust her reactions to political turns shows how clever she is. There is a lovely romantic tension in the book as well, kept quite proper and reserved and yet smoldering at the same time.

An intelligent and well crafted teen novel filled with political intrigue and a woman who will lead the way to change. Appropriate for ages 13-17.",1518566400,5
6965,1029,1805,"This is the second in the series, and you really should probably read the first book, The Truth About Love and Dukes, before reading this one. You can likely get away with not reading it if you really don't wish to, but it will explain Clara's relationship with her sisters in law as well as her family's history in relation to the ton.

I love that Clara is shy and that she's not classically beautiful, but that when Rex sees her smile that first time it just slays him. I saw the plot set up coming when she's sitting there trying to figure out how to advise these letters to Lady Truelove about how to get noticed by someone, when she has the same problem, and then overhears this suave rake giving his friend lady advice. Still, the way they got there was interesting. And I love that Rex is really such a gentleman, despite being labeled a rake. His mother sure is something else, though!

This is a fun, light read. I love the banter between Clara and Rex, and love the way he helps her, as she puts it, bloom. His advice to the shy is to laugh at yourself, let yourself be vulnerable and go ahead and admit to people that you're rather shy. Basically try to put others at ease around you and make them feel good about themselves, and everyone will love you. Clara doesn't magically transform into a beautiful swan to become the bell of the ball. Instead she works hard to overcome her shyness and gradually grows her own confidence, both in the ton as well as the rest of her life. They both have some great personal growth, but Clara especially. I also appreciate that Ms. Guhrke lets Clara's desire be to be a wife and mother - and that's OK, that's part of feminism too!

The only bit I didn't like was the scene at the wedding. I feel like Rex could have handled that better, and it just fell rather flat for the big scene it was supposed to be. It irked be enough that I knocked a full star off my rating. The ending matters, it can't just... fizzle.",1518566400,4
6966,134,1858,"He was no puppet. By his fathers blood and his own tenacity, he was a prince. A ruler. A god among men. And once he was through carving his destiny out of the blood and bone of those who stood in his way, everyone in Akram would bow before him, his name the prayer they raised as they begged for his mercy.

I haven't read any of the other books set in the Ravenspire universe, but I might have to go back and check them out now, because I thought that The Traitor Prince was pretty good. We follow Prince Javan Najafai after a failed assassination attempt and an imposter takes his place, forcing Javan to hide in Maqbara, the kingdoms most dangerous prison. The only way to expose the treachery is to compete in Marqbaras deadly tournament.

Things I Liked
Javan is such a good person. Hes actually an angel? He is so dedicated to his family and genuinely cares for his kingdom and his people. He has so much honor and integrity and just purity, that was admirable. But he never felt perfect or inaccessible.

These chapters were so incredible short that I flew through this book. It was just so easy to read and I didn't want to put it down.

Rahim was a good villainous character. He was smart, which I love in a villain, and he was actually scary. He is a threat and creates actual fear and tension in the story, and you don't know quite what to expect from him. He keeps the story interesting.

I really liked the friendship and partnership that develops between Javan and Sajda, the wardens number 2 who has secrets of her own. I felt like I saw their relationship progress and saw their trust building. So when a romantic turn came, I bought it.

Things I Didnt Like
I felt like the action was most successful in the beginning of the story and in the first round of the tournament when were in Javans POV. During the other rounds we see from different perspectives, while adding to those characters, detracted from the tension and anticipation in the action.

I felt like the ending was a little unsatisfying overall. Theres nothing too major that I didn't like, but it felt a little easy and some characters felt weaker. It just wasn't the strong finish I wanted from this story.

Overall Im really happy with this and Im surprised at how much I liked it. Javan was so pure and kind and it was impossible to not connect and want him to succeed. I really liked seeing the relationships form while in Maqbara and seeing the kingdom of Akram. The Traitor Prince was a quick and fun fantasy about honor and family that put me in fantastic reading mood.

I received a copy of the book from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review",1518566400,4
6967,1068,589,"This review is about a queen, a horse, and a frying pan.

I'm not kidding. it really is.

Okay, so this is loosely (and I mean LOOSELY( based on the nine day reign of Jane Grey after the death of her cousin, Edward. The narrators make it known that they are apologetic to England for what they're about to do to their history. Before you start reading, make sure you

1. Have a sense of humor and make sure it's intact.
2. Make sure nobody else is around unless you want them to think you're insane because of your constant snickering at the story.
3. Keep your horse close by and feed him lots of apples. He loves you. And apples. He also may be a man in disguise.

So, here it is:

People can turn into animals called Eians. Yes, you heard me right. ANIMALS. Thus the quarrel of the story. Edward had no male heirs so he leaves the crown to his cousin. Not only that, he marries her off to Gifford Dudley, who just so happens to shift into a horse. Every day. At the same time without fail. He thinks he's cursed because he can't control his shifting. Jane, is indifferent. Jane likes books better than she likes people thus Jane is my hero. Heroine? No matter.

We get three different POV's in this story. Edward, Jane and Gifford (call him G!). The minute I started the book I was thrown off by the Eians and the idea of tossing such magic into history, but then I realized what I was reading. I was also intimidated by the size of the book, but it went really fast. Mostly because I couldn't put it down. Like, I really couldn't. My hand cramped and I was afraid.

All in all, this book was a trip. Like a, WTF AM I READING, type of trip. I have the sequel ready and waiting, and I cannot wait to see what they come up with next.",1518566400,4
6968,452,1803,"The author delivers another great romance with an unexpected plot.  It has a happy ever after ending, with a plausible plot resolution.",1518566400,5
6969,1029,1799,"I really enjoyed this book! I've only recently started reading highlander romances, and I'm still iffy on if I love or hate them. A big part of that is the dialect, making the dialogue sometimes hard to schlep through. I feel that the dialect in Surrender to the Highlander was a little heavy handed, and also inconsistent. Edith would say ""not"" in one breath and in the next say ""no' "". Another character would refer to something as ""my plaid"" on one page and later ""me plaid"". After just finishing another highlander romance where they used ""nae"" for not, it felt uncomfortable to me to read the shifting ""no'/not"" in this book. I also REALLY didn't like Ronson's swearing. He supposedly picked it up from Niels and his brothers, but you never see the adults actually swearing that much, and certainly not that disgustingly. I felt it was overdone and off-putting and could have been handled with a little more delicate of a hand. And that's it, for what I didn't like, let's get on to all the things I loved!!

Surrender the Highlander also focuses a lot on the murder/mystery aspect of the storyline, which is great if you like that kind of thing and less great if you like your romances more emotionally plot driven. I happen to enjoy a little murder and mystery with my romance, so this worked for me! At times I wanted to shake the characters - especially Edith - and yell ""That is significant! What are you doing?! Tell Niels and the other people about that, ye gurt dummy!"" Without spoiling anything, I will just say that the plot revolves a lot around identifying and catching a murderer, and I kept having my suspicions about who did what and how and why. I was definitely kept guessing, and was super surprised at the big reveal (though I did have some inklings right just a chapter or two before that, so there was definitely foreshadowing!). That part of the plot was handled very masterfully, and I felt it wasn't just a cardboard cutout villain with wishy-washy motives.

I loved Edith, who is both fiery fierce and humbly kind. She works hard with her people and doesn't consider herself above them just because she's lady of the castle. She's very nave in some things (the fruit preserves!! OMG, I died!!) but isn't afraid to stick up for herself, for her people, and for what she knows is right. She's a strong and compassionate character, and has a great balance to her. Niels is also great, and I do love me a growly over-protective alpha male. Their dynamic is great, and while they only know each other for a short time (the entire book takes place over only a week or so, if I recall correctly) their relationship manages to feel like it develops fairly organically. (No insta-love here! Plenty of insta-lust though)

This is the fifth book in the series, but can be read as a stand alone. (I'm living proof, having not read the first four books myself!) It does have some spoilers for what I assume are the first four books in the series, since it talks about four other couples and that's typically the MCs of earlier books making a little cameo. Since I haven't read the first four books though I can't absolutely swear it, though Neils' brother and sister appear to me lead characters in two of them. Anyway, any spoilers aren't much more spoilery than what you already know from reading the blurb on the back cover/Goodreads.",1518566400,4

If you don't see the above quote in your copy evidently there are different copies of ""Common Sense"" with some variances. All have the standard four chapters; additions have other materials... Most of the versions I have come in books marked ""Common Sense and other writings by Thomas Payne.""

As you read ""Common Sense"" you'll realize there are several ways you can approach this information. One way is to look at it in the time period that it was written as one of his target readers. Another is to apply it to today's way of life. I actually had chosen as a combination. I also thought that I knew the Bible pretty well but found that I had to look up some quotations that he used.

I'm not going to go into detail as I don't want to spoil the surprise of how well he writes on the subject(s). I will say this is one of those books that you want to read before you die but I prefer to read it early so I can live by what I've read. Also I was surprised as with most people quote things like the Constitution or of the Bill of Rights so forth they always quote the large esoteric statements or concepts and forget tell you that it can get bogged down with tedium.

6974,1029,1778,"This book just didn't click with me, I'm not sure why. I absolutely loved The Trouble With Mistletoe (Heartbreaker Bay #2) and was so excited to read more of the Heartbreaker Bay series. It had all the great elements of my favorite type of contemporary romance: a small town feel, a feisty and fierce leading lady, a strong alpha male with a heart of gold, and even a case of penguin-napping to solve! It was fine, but if not for the very strong and heart-wrenching last 10% of the book where I finally really connected to the characters, this would have been a 3 star review for me. That last 10% was amazing enough to tack on an extra star, though!

I tagged this in my ""small town"" shelf because the series is about a group of people who all work or live in this strip mall or shopping center that I can't quite picture but there is apparently a quad in the center with a wishing fountain that grants true love. Kylie works in Reclaimed Woods, a furniture store in the building, as a woodworker, and Joe is a badass PI/bodyguard/bounty hunter that works at Hunt Investigations (also in the building). There's also a pet shop, a coffee shop/bakery, a gym, a tech company, some apartments, and I don't even remember what else. There are a LOT of characters and backstories to keep straight, which isn't so surprising as this is book #5 in a series that's clearly not finished yet.

Kylie and Joe have some great chemistry, and I love that they both had kind of screwed up childhoods in different ways, and they both wound up sort of parenting their parents. They've got some crazy explosive chemistry, but I like that they have that shared connection as well. Beyond that, I don't know, I just didn't emotionally connect with this book and I checked a lot to see how much was left before it was finished (never a good sign). Thank goodness for that last 10%! I also really like that there are little teasers for upcoming books/couples, like clearly Molly and Lucas are going to star in their own book - the tension there!! Also, Vinnie is clearly the best character in this whole book. <3

This is book #5 in the series, but it can definitely be read as a standalone - just be warned you're about to be bombarded with side characters, many of whom are already coupled off and whose stories are told in previous books. I'd only previously read the second book, The Trouble With Mistletoe, and there aren't really any spoilers for that book, probably because the main characters aren't really in this book at all. There are likely some minor spoilers for the earlier books, but not much more than you'd get by reading the back covers.",1518566400,4

6976,596,1839,"This really was a fantastic book.  I have been a fan of James Grippando for a long time so I was really eager to get my hands on this newest installment in his long running Jack Swyteck series.  This is the fourteenth book in the series but each book in the series works well as a stand alone novel.  I expect good things from both this author and this series and that is exactly what I got with this book.  I really had a great time reading this wonderful story.

This book opens with a bang and I quickly found myself both heartbroken and angry.  There are a lot of things in this book that made me angry and broke my heart because the subject matter is just really emotional.  The mystery involves the apparent lynching of a young black man at a local university which sparks a lot of racial tension in the community.

Jack becomes the lawyer for the young white man that has been accused of the murder.  I thought that this was a really interesting perspective into the crime.  There really doesn't appear to be a whole lot to tie the young man to the crime besides a racist text the his client denies sending.  The case ends up being a whole lot more complicated than anyone realizes.

I really liked how we get to see each stage of the legal process in this book.  Each stage is represented from initial questioning of the suspect, indictment, and bail hearing.  We see how difficult it can be for a lawyer to represent a client that doesn't always share what they should or take the advice given.  I felt the fear of the his client, Mark, as he goes to prison and fears for his future.

I liked the characters in this book.  I think that this series has been focusing less on Jack's personal life in later books.  There is still some scenes with Jack and his wife and daughter which I enjoyed.  Theo makes an appearance but doesn't play a big role and I have to say that I missed Theo working alongside Jack.  Andie, Jack's wife, does get some of her own action in this one to keep things interesting.  There were a few characters that were easy to hate such as the prosecutor who is more focused on his re-election than justice.

I do highly recommend this series to others.  This was a book that really kept me thinking and glued to the pages.  It really was a great story with twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end.  I can't wait to read more from this talented author.

Celebrities, business tycoons, and politicians are accused of extramarital affairs and are disgraced by scandal. Careers are over, families are humiliated, and lives are changed forever. But this story is different; this is the story of Angela, the wife.

How well do you really know your husband?

Jason, Angela, and Spencer Powell are living happy successful lives when the unthinkable happens. Jason, a successful executive and college professor is accused of sexual harassment and misconduct.  Angela, his wife struggles to make sense of the chaos and maintain the stability of her family.

What do you wear to court for your husbands rape case?

Readers see normal lives deteriorate into chaos. Alternating points of view bring out all the unsavory details of the story and its participants. We gain insight into Angelas personal struggles, and get a different perspective of the whole situation as the case unfolds. The line between guilt and innocence becomes blurred, and we understand Angelas anxiety.

Pretty soon the trolls will start looking for secrets about you and me.

Things are not what they appear to be in many ways. Piece by piece the puzzle emerges, her background, his background, the scandal, the betrayal, the tragedy, but the pieces do not seem to fit. Little by little, the complicated picture becomes more clear  maybe.

It was one persons word against another in a system where the government had to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Readers follow a path that twists and turns in unexpected ways.

6981,816,1799,"Whenever I see a new Lynsay Sands historical, I get grabby hands! I know every book is going to be a quick fun read that has me laughing out loud, and Surrender to the Highlander was no exception. While you can probably read these books as standalones, I think you will have much more fun with the series if you start at the beginning, with An English Bride in Scotland.

I am totally head over heels in love with the Buchanan family. While I think my favorite is the broody and scarred Aulay, I can't deny that I would love to hang out with the fun-loving Buchanan brood who tease and taunt each other at every turn.

Our hero in this installment is Neils Buchanan, the third son in the family line-up. Saidh Buchanan, the sole sister who is currently large with child, persuades the boys to go check on her friend who had been ill and stopped responded to messages. The boys reluctantly make their way to Drummond keep and quickly discover that someone wishes the Drummonds harm and has been doing a speedy job of dispatching of the family. Neils was a great hero. He was a large lusty lad who was protective over our heroine and determined to discover who meant her harm. Neils wasn't as humorous as some of the brothers, but his reaction to humorous situations was endearing and made me love him all the more.

Edith Drummond has lost most of her family and has been hanging on to her own life by a thread. When the Buchanan brothers show up on her door and discover that she has been poisoned, Edith must come to terms with the idea that her family was murdered and someone is actively trying to kill her. But with the big brawny Highlander dogging her tail, Edith has a hard time focusing on the danger when she is distracted by steamy kisses and erm... other things. Surprisingly, Edith had me laughing out loud more than the Buchanans. I had tears coming out of my eyes on Edith's wedding night and her implementation of the advice she had gotten from a maid. I still crack up just thinking about it. Edith was a good heroine, somewhat careless with her safety, but she was likable and fun and a good match for Neils.

Given Edith's poisoning and illness, this romance was not instalove. There was definitely instant attraction on both sides, but the romance unfolded at a nice pace along with the rest of the story. Both danger and humorous obstacles were thrown in Neils and Edith's path, and they handled everything with aplomb. I enjoyed seeing both the buildup and some of their life following the marriage, and I was glad that the some of the Buchanan brothers had a heavy presence in the story.

Surrender to the Highlander was a perfect blend of romance, mystery, suspense and humor. I will be waiting for the next installment on pins and needles.

Hamlet, however, does not get the same treatment, and that's fair enough: he is, merely a placeholder for the pre-imperial inbred malaise that haunts the English court, and, by way of metaphor, the Danish kingdom.

I'd put off reading this book for a while, because usually when there is so much hype about a book, it doesn't live up to my expectations. I finally made myself read it, because I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.

I felt like I was right there in Jackson, Mississippi along with Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny.

6986,742,425,"Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Underground Railroad is a great book destined for classic status in American Literature. The author is Colin Whitehead a wonderful African-American author and graduate of Harvard. He can write with brilliance in the knowledge he possesses of antebellum life on a Southern plantation and the lyrical yet realistic way he weaves his tale of Cora. She is a young African-American woman who lives on the horrible Randall family cotton plantation in Georgia,. The farm is owned by two brother James and Terrance. James lives on the upper farm and indulges himself with trips to brothels in New Orleans. Terrance would make Harriet Beecher Stowe's Simon Legree from Uncle Tom's Cabin look good in comparison! He rapes and hangs, beats and insults his slaves with cruelty and pure animal hatred. Cora and her friend Caesar escape the plantation and hitch a ride on the underground railroad. This is a literal railroad built by abolitionists to aid the trip from slavery to freedom. Cora and Caesar flee through Georgia and live for a time in South Carolina. Murder occurs on their bloody odyssey to freedom. Cora learns to read in South Carolina and eventually reaches Indiana where she lives on the farm of a freed half African-American. All goes well in this location  until the evil slavecatcher Ridgeway attacks the black community. Cora escapes and flees to the West and freedom. Brilliant speeches and taut narrative make this novel an American treasure. The author was recently interviewed on C-Span's In Depth author's program and is an eloquent spokesperson for the oppressed. The history of African-Americans in the United States has been a series of cruelty and the overcoming of endemic racism to achieve worthy goals. The book is essential to anyone wanting to understand the black experience in this land.
  The book is filled with horror stories and the plight of the slave is vividly and unforgettably portrayed. Gone With the Wind this book ""ain't"".",1518652800,5

6990,1114,681,"Very dated, even though the book is not that old: funny given that any collection by James Baldwin reads like a breath of fresh air even when I have no idea what his references are. I was often very bored. When I wasn't, I was still not surprised, because even though Gay says all the right things, especially on race, they are not exactly revelatory and have been voiced elsewhere, often in a better way. I was also very uncomfortable with how limited, very American Gay's view of life is. She never transcends the provincialism of an American, which is, again, not something that stunted Baldwin (sorry but also not, let's pretend that this comparison is my ""bad feminist"" indulgence). Yes, Gay is a woman of color, but she is in her own nerdy bubble, and she doesn't really see outside much: except for reading news, seeing mainstream films and reading mainstream books.

I think that this limited worldview is best seen in her essay where she juxtaposes Trayvon Martin and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. It's pretty much a saint vs devil situation, and I share her resentment for
it, but the lack of nuance is so disturbing. Gay completely glosses over the fact that Tsarnaev, even though enjoying the public'a fascination and will to redeem, is a Muslim person, a minority as dangerously disenfranchised as the black male in the states. He is also of Chechen origin: hailing from a country painfully colonized and broken. To make him the entitled white man who still gets sympathy after performing a terrorist act is incredibly blindsided.",1518652800,3
6991,62,16,"Before you immediately hate what I say, make sure you read all of my thoughts.  This is actually the second time I am trying to give this book a try.  I started this last year and I immediately thought it was going to live up to the hype as I was shedding tears within only a few pages.  I ended up putting it down after that, as I found the story was dragging.  This had nothing to do with the message within this story, but the pacing itself.  I feel it could have been a five star read if the author cut out some of the filler sections.

This time around I decided to try the audiobook as I have been really enjoying so many more reads with this format.  I really enjoyed the audiobook, as I do feel the narrator brings something extra to the story, especially the emotional sections.

I loved the Harry Potter and basketball references.  I agree that this is a very important story in our world today.  You will cry, you will laugh, you will get mad, and it will challenge your way of thinking.  Overall, it was pretty good just did not blow it away story wise that I was expecting (minus the message around it.)",1518652800,4
6992,902,1860,"One of my favorite types of premise in a mystery is a cold case, I love the idea that a criminal thinks theyve managed to stay off the polices radar only for new evidence to be uncovered years later and put their freedom in jeopardy. The case of Annalise is the type that had instant fame that lasted years, even after her body was found AND especially since her killer was never caught. A pretty young teenager that vanished only to be found years later is legendary in Lilling and the links between past and present turned out to be chilling and intriguing.

Apparently this is the fourth book in a series but since I didn't even realize until after I had finished this, it clearly wasn't an issue for me. There is definitely a tricky history between Chloe and Morris but there was enough information provided that I felt caught up. You hear from Chloe and Morris but also from Annalise Williams, a young woman with an odd fascination with Annalise Wood and Laurie a therapist who treats Annalise. Most of the story is told in a straightforward, linear timeline but there were a few chapters with transcripts from Annalises therapy sessions that I really enjoyed.

This was fast paced, its under 300 pages and I flew through it at a rapid pace. Theres a heavy emphasis on the psychology of the characters and Im not sure if thats just because theres a therapist as one of the characters or if its the norm for Winslow, but either way I liked the depth that it added. Recommended for those who enjoy character driven mysteries with smart twists and strong writing.

6993,134,1857,"This book was such a beautiful surprise. I expected a fun space story with an interesting relationship between Zara, the main character, and Nadim the sentient alien ship shes partnered with. Honor Among Thieves was so much more than a simple story, it was an exploration of self, personal connection, and fighting for what is right. And I am so incredibly happy to have read it.

Things I Liked
Nadim was the greatest! He was so easy to connect to and I loved him so so so much. He was honest, earnest, and endearing . I just really like learning about all the Leviathans. They were so interesting and I loved their admiration for space and the stars.

The relationships were stellar and filled with such reverence and respect. I was utterly captivated by the emotional bonds that formed between Zara and Nadim. I felt their relationship and it was glorious. I also loved the deep friendship that forms between Zara and Beatriz through the story. Again, it so respectful and honest and Im here for all the lady friendships. I also really loved seeing Beatriz and Nadim slowly bond through the story.

There was a ton of diversity in the story! We get two female leads who are people of color, Zara is black and Beatriz is Brazilian. There are also a Chinese side character, Chao-Xang. I also loved seeing the balance of STEM fields and creative fields, showing people can excel in both areas.

There was really good tension and suspense in the action scenes. The threats felt real and dangerous creating drama and high stakes. I wasn't expecting much action wise, but all the scenes were incredibly well done and I FELT it.

Things I Didnt Like
Part One was so weak compared to the rest of the book, it honestly felt like it was part of another story. It was incredibly fast paced and jumped over all the learning and training that would have been really interesting. And I didn't care at all about the Deluca side plot that completely fell away after part one ended. Part One really seemed like weak filler until we got to the amazingness that is the rest of the book.

This books was so heartwarming and beautiful and I was completely captivated by the emotions in the story. It was honesty a beautiful surprise that I genuinely loved. Honor Among Thieves is a captivating story of connection and emotion that completely grips you and takes you on a marvelous ride.

I received a copy of the book from the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.",1518652800,5
6994,1114,322,"In addition to everything else, an interesting study of alleged mental health issues in patients of different gender identities. Everyone is gaslighting Hamlet but no one gaslights Ophelia, because she is female and therefore allowed to be hysterical. Then again, her insanity defies gender norms, she becomes a revelled image, absurd and flamboyant, camp, and then a corpse: just like male figures before her, Yorick, Caesar and Alexander, jesters equated to kings by becoming dust. Hamlet, however, does not get the same treatment, and that's fair enough: he is, merely a placeholder for the pre-imperial inbred malaise that haunts the English court, and, by way of metaphor, the Danish kingdom. He is serious as a heart attack and dies along with the squares.

When I think of Achilles, I think of Brad Pitt and his exposed buttocks. I know, right? It's literally the only thing I can remember about that movie. 

I love reading books that contain elements of Greek mythology. We've all heard of Helen of Troy, Achilles, and the battle that lasted 10 years. This was better. Madeline Miller has created a beautiful story about hope and understanding. She also shows us how one man's pride can impact thousands, and yet he's able to continue down a selfish path of destruction.

The Song of Achilles had me raging on the inside. The unnecessary violence, the treatment of girls and women, and how male lovers were ignored and not openly accepted. I wanted to smash people in the face and show them what righteous anger looks like.

Chiron is usually my favorite character whenever he's included in a story, and this time was no different. The few years that Patroclus and Achilles spent with him was my favorite part of the book. I hated when they had to leave, and wish they could have just stayed with him forever.

It's a long book, but definitely worth it. It's starts off with them as children, we see their friendship begin, and then we get to watch as they discover a deeper love for each other. All of this happens while training and knowing that war is inevitable. It's been Achilles' destiny since birth, and not something he is able to escape.

I really loved this book. I listened to the Audible audiobook and the narration was fantastic. Sometimes you get a narrator who is so in character that you are swept away by the story. And that was the case with this production.

Along with his usual vivid storytelling and imaginings, this book is packed with likeable characters who are so different from one another that you don't even have a chance to get bored with any of them. The story is fast-paced and entertaining. Strongly recommend!",1518652800,5
6998,972,1800,"This is another one of those books that start off so strong and really drew me in, but then I lost some interest in it during the middle, and I kind of got it back towards the end.

I loved the beginning of this book so much. There were honestly so many amazing one-liners and sentences/quotes in this book, but definitely a ton in the beginning. It honestly drew me right in and I adored Jack. I also really appreciated how the actual problem of the story revolved around Jack, both his past and his present. You usually see this kind of bad stuff happen the other way around, so I liked seeing it play out in Jack's life, but I do wish we could've delved into it more. It's certainly not as deep or emotional as it could've been.

Katie was pretty cool and I loved how badass yet innocent she is. I will say that there's not too much to her character and this is more of a Jack-centric story than anything else. The book is also pretty minimal when it comes to the drama and angst, so if you like that, then by all means, dive into this.

I will also say that this is right on par with how you expect Bailey's writing and her books to be. It's very reminiscent of her Broke and Beautiful series, which is her New Adult series. It's definitely not as explicit as she can be, but there's plenty of good times to be had. I'm also very curious about the other characters in this series and definitely want to check out the next book revolving around Jack's friend, Danika and a certain surly lieutenant.",1518652800,4

It's not well-written and dark enough to be proper southern gothic, not dizzying enough to make for a great queer romance, not daring enough to be a constructive anti-racist statement, and not subversive enough to be feminist. Meanwhile, I do understand the value of having something this widely read to feature themes like lesbian families, race and class, I'm most definitely not the target audience. But it was a sweet and quick read, I would even say comforting, if I didn't have so many questions lingering.",1518652800,3
7000,816,1803,"Beyond Scandal and Desire kicks off a new series from Lorraine Heath, Sins for All Seasons, featuring a family of unwanted by-blows sent off to a baby farmer as infants. I love that Lorraine has taken this sad and tragic historical detail and given it a lighter spin, while staying true to the life that faced bastards and the lower classes of the day.

Historically and most notoriously in the Victorian era, baby farmers would accept custody of unwanted children, usually by-blows, in exchange for a fee. Unfortunately, a good number of baby farmers pocketed the payment and killed the infants. Lorraine has put another spin on this baby farmer and matriarch, Ettie Trewlove. Rathering than planting the babes in her garden, Widow Trewlove raised five bastards to the best of her ability, and they are to be our adult heroes and heroines of this series.

The hero of this first book, and head of the family of societal outcasts, is Mick Trewlove. Mick has risen above his circumstances and become a self-made man, but doors are still closed to him due to the stain of his birth. There was some great imagery involved in Mick's character that got my imagination going... he approaches through encroaching darkness like the fog rolling in... with midnight locks, thick beard, and dark eyes. I could totally see this in my head. It was great. Mick has learned that his father is a duke, and he concocts a plan to force the duke to acknowledge him. Unfortunately this plan would end up hurting at least one innocent person, if not more. I normally do not like deception in my romances... but I found myself being somewhat forgiving of Mick. I guess this just proves what a heroine hater I am, because I would not have accepted this behavior from a heroine. I understood Mick's anger and pain and some of his justifications, but I always held out hope that he would abandon his plan. I did think he was a good hero despite his nefarious plans.

I was not a heroine hater in this particular book. I actually liked our heroine, Lady Aslyn Hastings. Asyln was orphaned as a child and became the ward of the Duke of Hedley, who raised her in his household with his legitimate son and his frail duchess. I don't think a person could really hate Aslyn if they tried... she was genuinely a good person. She wasn't a snob and didn't look down on people who were a victim of their circumstances, and she displayed good moral character. Despite being a good person to begin with, there was still room for Aslyn to grow as the story progressed, and she did so with grace and maturity.

The relationship between these two took some time to unfold. Mick was intent on seducing Asyln for his own purposes, and Asyln was intrigued by the mystery and freedom that Mick could offer her. I really liked watching this relationship unfold. I particularly enjoyed the contrast of Aslyn and Mick's characters. Asyln was a representation of light (fair and good) whereas Mick represented the dark (broody and dangerous). I thought this worked really well within the confines of the story.

I'm not always a fan of the aristocratic lady being paired with the commoner love interest, but I think I am going to like the dynamics of this series. The Trewloves were all interesting characters in their own right, and I think every character was engaging enough to warrant their own story. I am looking forward to following along with each new release.

I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book that I received from the publisher, Avon.",1518652800,4
7001,808,276,"""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.""

The Bennet's are one such family with five unmarried daughters and the family estate entailed away from the female line but prejudice abounds. The unexpected and sudden appearance of the eligible, rich and handsome Mr Darcy known locally for his pride and incivility and the slightly less rich but milder mannered and more even tempered Mr Bingley provokes great excitement in most if not all quarters:

""Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.""

""I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.""

And so it proceeds. Will pride and prejudice prevent any satisfactory alliance?

After watching the BBC TV series numerous times, I decided it was finally time to read this period classic. The BBC have done a good job in being faithful to the original work, other than the ending which is extended a lot in the book. The TV series is also very well cast and the characters represented as I'm sure the author had envisaged when writing. (I did not like the more modern movie version.)

7002,1077,69,"Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" is not the polished, skillfully crafted novel that her ""Pride and Prejudice"" is, but I nevertheless found it nearly as entertaining and wonderfully written and it has an array of rich characters.

The subject matter is, once again, upper class British society and how money, land ownership, titles, and good looks influences who you marry much more than love; and how a woman's livelihood depended so much on the men they married.

At times, I found myself thinking how bizarre it had to be to be part of such a society and then I remember back to my experiences in Los Angeles and the upper east side of Manhattan and it all seemed so relevant, some two hundred years later.

I strongly recommend this book, and without giving away any of the many story lines, love does occasionally win out.",1518739200,5

7004,886,21,"I read this book because it was a Goodreads nominee under Mystery. It starts out very interesting and the characters are intriguing but it gets stranger and the characters are either super manipulative or easily manipulated. The sleep stuff is weird but it didn't seem to be that big of a deal in the beginning. It does end up being a pretty convenient plot device for the author, though. The tone of the book continued to get weirder and more tedious but I kept at it because though it took forever to get 50% in, I was still interested enough to keep going. Turned out to be a really weird sci fi twist at the end and I felt like an idiot for wasting my time. I like all kinds of genres but the jarring shift from regular old psycho suspense to sci fi/horror was too much. I should have anticipated disappointment with this author since I read her take on Snow White and that too was a colossal waste of time. That book, like this one, read like 2 totally different books mashed into 1 by the end. Shame on me for going back for more punishment.

7008,371,70,"People looking for an explanation of Donald Trump's popularity among low-income and unemployed white Americans can get a little enlightenment from this memoir. The author, J.D. Vance, was born into an Appalachian hillbilly family with Scotch-Irish roots. Though the word hillbilly is often used in a pejorative sense, it's defined as 'people who live in rural, mountainous areas in the United States, primarily in Appalachia and the Ozarks.'

Mountain people traditionally work blue collar jobs, and the closing of factories, mines, and mills in their towns left many hillbillies unemployed and disheartened. Moreover, those hill folk who do have jobs, and a good work ethic, resent their taxes being used to subsidize their unemployed neighbors - who they consider lazy whiners who illicitly profit from food stamps, eat steaks, and buy gewgaws like cell phones.....which many working hillbillies can't afford.

If these indolent food stamp recipients DO get work, they show up sporadically, and slack off when they're present. Vance tells a story about a hillbilly who - when he deigned to show up for work - took five half-hour bathroom breaks during his shift. Naturally, the man was fired.....and probably thought he was done wrong.

All this leads the working poor to resent welfare nets/entitlement programs associated with the Democratic Party.

According to Vance, economically disadvantaged hill folk - many of whom disdain education and resent locals who better themselves ('get too big for their britches') - have a culture of 'learned helplessness.' They're poor, they're resentful, and they want someone to blame. Thus, Donald Trump 'speaks to them' with his diatribes about jobs going overseas, rapist immigrants, callous environmentalists, terrorist Muslims, and so on.

Vance claims that the hillbillies dislike of Obama doesn't focus on race, but rather on the fact that he's a cultured Ivy League graduate who speaks well and doesn't understand their concerns. I don't totally buy this argument since I've met some Scotch-Irish descendants who express their dislike of black people in colorful terms. Be that as it may, I do understand the attraction of disaffected people to a rabble rouser like Trump.

*****

Vance grew up in Middletown, Ohio, with a drug-addicted mother who hooked up with a long string of boyfriends and husbands. Luckily for the author, he was able to take refuge in the home of his grandparents - Mamaw and Papaw - who lived down the street. Mamaw and Papaw grew up in Jackson, Kentucky and married at the ages of 13 and 16, respectively, when Mamaw got pregnant. Like many other residents of eastern Kentucky, the young couple took the 'hillbilly highway' to Ohio - where the steel mills offered good-paying jobs.....until they closed.

For much of their marriage Mamaw and Papaw had a troubled home, since Papaw was a raging alcoholic. However, Vance's grandparents provided him with unconditional love, a sense of stability, and the will to learn and improve himself. Thus Vance eventually served in the Marines, went to Ohio State University, and graduated from Yale Law School.

Unfortunately, the author's early years, during which he observed constant screaming and throwing matches between his mother and her men, left Vance without a framework for a healthy relationship. Vance admits he was a 'bad husband' until his wife Usha, whom he met at Yale Law School, helped him learn the proper way to disagree.

Vance speaks lovingly of his 'lunatic' Mamaw, who carried a gun and wasn't afraid to use it. Everyone feared her, which worked to the boy's advantage during his mother's many stints in rehab. Mamaw insisted on caring for young J.D. herself - though she didn't have fostering credentials - and kept him out of the system.

Vance was strongly attached to all the members of his family, including his sister; aunts; uncles; cousins; and especially his great-grandmother - Mamaw Blanton - whom he often visited in beautiful eastern Kentucky.....which he considered his true home. Like many hillbillies, Vance was (and is) intensely loyal to his clan, and any insult to himself or his kinfolk resulted in a fist fight.....starting at age six. As an adult Vance still has a bad temper, and takes pride in being able to restrain himself, like the time he wanted to - but DIDN'T - confront a driver who flipped him off.

Vance relates some interesting (and humorous) anecdotes about his ignorance of the 'outside world' as a young adult. For instance, when Vance bought his first car, a fellow marine made him shop around for a car loan.....not just accept the dealer's high interest rate. And during dinner with a potential employer at a fancy restaurant, Vance had to sneak off to call Usha- for instructions about the over-abundant cutlery. During that same meal, the author spit out his first sip of sparkling water - thinking something was wrong with the carbonated beverage. Moreover, Vance had to learn about professional attire. The author wore jeans and combat boots to an early job interview, before he learned that a suit was the appropriate garb. These are telling stories about the cultural divide between mountain folk and the 'educated elite' they disdain.

Vance acknowledges that hillbillies need help, but their situation is complex....and Vance can't pinpoint the best way to assist them. An influx of jobs would be good, but wouldn't solve the sociocultural problems like family conflict; drinking; drug addiction; poor eating habits; bad health; bad teeth; aversion to learning; disinclination to work; over-spending; and so on. Also, to successfully 'climb the ladder', people have to WANT to pull themselves up.....and this doesn't seem to be the case among hillbillies right now.

In an interview after the book was published, Vance cites a study that says upward mobility is stymied by living in neighborhoods with concentrated poverty; and residing in neighborhoods with a lot of single mothers. Addressing these issues might provide an initial boost to underprivileged groups.

Vance also remarks that religion (Christianity in this case) helped his biological father and himself focus and make better personal choices. In Vance's words, ""Id make one important point: that not drinking, treating people well, working hard, and so forth, requires a lot of willpower when you didn't grow up in privilege. That feelingwhether its real or entirely fakethat theres something divine helping you and directing your mind and body, is extraordinarily powerful.""

Vance also notes, ""I remain incredibly optimistic about the future. Maybe thats the hillbilly resilience in me. Or maybe Im just an idiot. But if writing this book, and talking with friends and strangers about its message, has taught me anything, its that most people are trying incredibly hard to make it, even in this complicated and scary world.""

Vance is a political conservative and a reluctant (I think) Trump supporter. He wants his people to have better lives - and has made a push in that direction with this memoir.

I like the book, which has many interesting and instructive tales about Vance's life, his struggles, and his successes. I'd recommend the book to everyone interested in what's going on in the country today.",1518739200,4

She can't remember what happened that landed her in the hospital, but she knows it wasn't good, and by listening to the chatter of people coming in and out of her hospital room, she knows the police suspect her husband.

Alternating between the week prior to her accident, her present, and a series of childhood diary entries from two decades ago, this psychological thriller questions whether or not things are really lies if you believe they are the truth...

My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:
1. Im in a coma.
2. My husband doesnt love me anymore.
3. Sometimes I lie.

Let me just start by saying that Sometimes I Lie was SO GOOD! I wanted to binge read the entire thing, and did read the majority of the book all at once! It opens in a gripping way, with Amber in a coma in the hospital, but unsure of what happened to put her there, and alternates her past with her present in a suspenseful way.

The alternating timelines worked out perfectly in this book, because you can tell that the timelines will converge and lead to a big reveal, so it really created a suspense ridden atmosphere! There were a lot of twists and turns throughout the book, and the end had me speechless! I didn't see most of the twists coming, and definitely didn't have this book figured out, so there were definitely times that my jaw dropped!

Alice Feeney did a phenomenal job of building suspense, tension, and casting doubt on many characters - she's a wonderful storyteller, and I was absolutely shocked to find out that this was her debut thriller! I can't wait to read more of her books in the future, especially the sequel to this one next year! I read that this book has been optioned for a TV series, and I would love to see that!

If you're a fan of psychological thrillers with characters you aren't sure you can trust, you'll definitely want to pick this one up! I think this will be a book that everyone will be talking about in 2018, and I can't blame them! Sometimes I Lie comes out in the US on March 13, 2018, so make sure to pick this one up!

Some reviewers are complaining about the lack of mice in the story, considering the title. Granted, I only read the first few chapters but most of it was about mice! Lenny is obsessed with them; dashing into bushes to catch them, pretending he's collecting wood when he's hunting them, dreaming of them. His life's goal is to find mice....and copy George.

That's about all I learned from the book as I was forced to abandon it due to the abundance of strong language and blasphemy.

Has anyone else noticed the complete double standards in our education system; teachers happy to rebuke children most severely for daring to use this type of language in speech, yet promoting and encouraging the study and retention of it in English literature lessons. This, all because it has been labelled a classic.

Perhaps you'll be lucky enough to find my copy with all the swear words crossed out. If not, stay away from this. You might also want to check that your children aren't busily absorbing it in school as the language will undoubtedly find its way into their speech sooner or later....",1518739200,1

7018,68,819,"There has been a lot of hype around this book, and I was looking forward to reading it.  I did enjoy it, but I found that I was figuring out key things before they were revealed in the book.  This diminished the suspense for me.  I'm not sure why that was happening, but it did.  I don't think that I can summarize the plot for this book without giving away key and vital parts.  The book does have the best descriptions that I've ever read about agoraphobia and the hell that people endure every day when they suffer from this.  I thought Anna was very well portrayed, and as I was reading I noticed that I was seeing the whole story from her eyes.  I felt the fear and confusion that she felt.  I felt her loneliness and I heard her mute calls for help, that no one in the book really seemed to hear, even if they were supposed to be helping her.  Fans of the psychological suspense genre will enjoy this book.",1518739200,4
7019,235,1833,"I saw Rose McGowan on an episode of The View recently. I found her edgy, forthcoming, and, well, brave.

Same with this book. Rose is rough around the edges. She does not mince words. All the same, she says and said things that not many others will. She confronted the hard stuff. She put her heart out there for all to see. Sometimes you think a Hollywood actress has an easy life, but whatever ease Rose McGowan found, she earned the hard way. Starting her life raised in a cult in Italy with an alcoholic and abusive father and an emotionally absent mother, Rose had good reason to be a little tempestuous.

She may not always be well-liked. She may be hard to hear at times because shes brusque; however, her message about Hollywood and how it shapes women is an important one.

 Review of the audio read by Rose McGowan. I think hearing her read her own words added to the authenticity and poignancy.",1518739200,4

Most of the story involves our heroine unraveling a number of mysteries about the human and alien civilization on this small planet.  There is a lot of conspiracy and some adventure.  The story was fast-paced, well written, and easy to read..

Overall I ended up enjoying this book a lot.  I loved the fast-pace of the story, the mystery, the adventure, the creative setting, and the engaging characters.  This was an intriguing and fun YA sci-fi read about a small science-based human civilization on a far away planet.",1518739200,4
7023,641,1858,"Gah, I love this series so much! It's been hard to pick a favourite book so far, seeing as I read THE WISH GRANTER last week and was completely entranced by it, but THE TRAITOR PRINCE just might have taken the top spot! The story was engaging and interesting right from the get-go, and it was a huge adventure from there. The characters were fantastic! Javan was the kind of person you constantly wanted to cheer for (and who can slay monsters like nobody's business). Sajda is a super tough girl with a lot of baggage but who was easily one of my favourite characters in the book. Even wicked Rahim was interesting and compelling in his own way. The action was stellar and had me constantly turning the pages to find out what would happen next. Of all the romances, this one is likely my favourite. There was fantastic chemistry and swoon-worthy passion between Javan and Sajda and I couldn't get enough. The entire story truly read like a fairy tale, and I'm thrilled to have this on my shelves. I honestly cannot wait for the next book, and hopefully more after that!",1518739200,5

7025,656,1316,"Warning: If you have ever worked in Big Corporate America, reading this book could make you feel like you're actually at work. (Which may or may not be a good thing!) Author Jillian Medoff absolutely nails it when it comes to office politics, office ""spouses,"" office boredom and office maneuvering.

But the heart and soul of the book is the human toll extracted by corporate layoffs (hence the title), especially when they seem to keep coming one after another. It is about the individual pain and eventual empowerment of losing your job, the combination of the cold-heartedness and heartbreak on the boss's part when determining who gets the ax and who doesn't, and the survivor guilt for those who are left in the office.

Set in New York City just after the 2008 financial crash, the book's characters all work in the Human Resources department of Ellery, a small/mid-size consumer research firm. There is the HR chief, still a fighter at the end of her career, although work is all she really has; the up-and-coming chief who is unable to find true love but has a wonderful office spouse, who is happily married with two kids but can't seem to get motivated to work; the gay man who is everyone's caretaker; the black Wharton graduate who is so full of himself he puts his job in jeopardy; and the sweet, smart and super-efficient administrative assistant. These characters are a microcosm of almost any companyand that is why the story works so well.

Bonus: The epilogue is brilliant!",1518739200,4
7026,1002,1316,"It was an excellent character-driven novel about a large company dealing with the recession and all the repercussions of that. There wasn't a lot of action, but a ton of character development and a great story line surrounding those core characters.

I really enjoyed most of the characters, and at the very least, could appreciate their aspirations and motivations. It was enlightening to see these high level executives floundering, worrying about their lives and trying to figure out what they want to be when they ""grow up"". They were all lead by the wonderful character, Rosa, who is fierce and loyal and so kind.

I really loved Rosa and mostly the fact that while the sections from her point of view were limited, it was easy to see her in all the other sections as well. She was a character that had a lot of influence on the others, not only in her professional, working life, but in hers and her employees personal lives as well. It was inspiring to see the influence that she had on others simply by being their advocate and caring for them.

This was an excellent look at a modern workplace and the fears, anxieties and uncertainties that can come from simply being employed during a recession. It was great to see the growth of the characters and I especially loved the epilogue. A great read that I would recommend to anyone who loves character-driven books.",1518739200,4

This is one book that is guaranteed to get you in all the feels. Starting off with a hunting accident that ends in the death of a five-year-old boy, and going through all the family members touched by the incident, Erdrich never lets up.

Landreaux takes a shot at a deer, but at the last minute the deer springs away, and he realizes he has killed his best friend's son, Dusty, To make amends, he and his wife give the family their own son, LaRose. This is only the beginning of a multi-generational epic, as Landreaux seeks redemption.

This book has so many themes: loss, suicide, forgiveness, redemptionthat I wonder how Erdrich managed to keep track of them. Throughout the book, the stories of the various generations of people named LaRose tie them all together in a masterpiece of fiction.

I started reading this as a library book, but soon I realized that one reading is not enough to take in the richness. I bought a copy for my Kindle so I could re-read it at my leisure.",1518739200,5
7028,676,1836,"One of the trends in books, and in entertainment in general, that I particularly appreciate is recognizing the scientific achievements of women.  As the mother of a daughter, this is a welcome trend and one I would like to support.  So, when I heard about this book, I knew I had to give it a try.

Here's the thing, though.  I feel like I'm the victim of a bait and switch.  This book is not about the ""Atomic City girls.""  There are two story lines and one of them does involve a young woman, but not to the point that it got into any sort of scientific achievement.  Instead, it was more a case of girl finds herself in a not entirely appropriate relationship.  The other half of the relationship, the physicist Sam, actually seems to be more of the focus of that particular plot.  Because of this, it all just felt off.  The title told me that the whole book was about June (or June and others...the ""girls"" is plural!) and then it gives more weight to the male character?

The other story line centers around an African-American man, Joe.  This was the more interesting of the two plots for me (ironic, given the title of this book!).  I felt that Joe was a more well-rounded character and that his actual story was far more nuanced.  I would have rather read a book based solely on this plot than one where it tried to focus on two.  When a novel runs two parallel stories, there needs to be a point where the stories become intertwined with each other.  In this book, there is a scene where Joe passes June's roommate on the street and...that's it.  As a result, the story never felt finished to me.

There were a few things I liked.  As I said, Joe's story did hook me, and I liked that Sam and June's relationship was believable throughout the book.  At tines, Beard made the setting of Oak Ridge, Tennessee and actual character in the book, and I wished she had done that more often.

This was not a successful read for me, although I think the potential was there (and it might have been more successful with a different title and more accurate synopsis!).  I would be open to read more from Janet Beard in the future, although I can't say that I would recommend this book.",1518739200,2

7030,837,385,"To be fair, I must say Im not a huge fiction or chic lit  fan, and this book is a bit of both. I guess itd be classed as historical fiction, but there was too much fluff for my liking. It has a small section at the beginning before the war actually begins, just long enough to learn names of a few of the men, who soon become minor characters. It focuses mainly on 3 war widows ? Spoiler if I give away more in that area.  Im not sure what my gripe was with this book,other than it was hard to connect with the characters. I kept hoping Id find at least one I liked, but I never did. Too much romance for my liking. I guess the one redeeming quality was that it helped you to see what it was like in post WW 2 for the people left to pick up the pieces and carry on. Im sure there is an audience for this book thatd like it, but I wasn't really in that crowd.",1518739200,3
7031,676,660,"Reading the summary of this book, I bet you think that it is about a girl trying to get her first boyfriend, right?  Well, not so fast,  That may happen in the book, but that's not what the book is about.  A cynical person might call this a bait and switch, but I see it as a delightful surprise.

So what is this book actually about?  It's a beautiful story of how our relationships change as we grow up.  Yes, there are Young Adult Relationships here, but the real relationship is between Molly and Cassie.  As twins, they've always been close but they are at a turning point as they start to differentiate from each other and find their own ways.  It's bittersweet and authentic, and something with which everyone, even non-twins, can sympathize.

Molly is a complex but realistic character.  She isn't wholly likable, but what seventeen year old is?  She struggles with her circumstances, her emotions, and her anxiety and it is all painfully true.  But she also grows as the story progresses, and does so in a way that makes sense.  At no point did I ever feel like her transformation skipped a step or went a direction it shouldn't.

The romance feature of this book is well-done and satisfying.  Albertalli expertly captures Molly's angst, not only with her desire to be in a relationship, but also watching her twin sister forge ahead with her own relationship.  I'm not sure how accurate the depiction of modern teen life is (because I'm old, um, older) but I didn't feel as though I needed to question it.

Another feature that I loved about this book is that it is set during the summer of 2015, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.  While it was heartwarming to read of Molly's moms finally being able to get married, what really got me was that feeling of a world where things were more optimistic and inclusive.  I call this the Obama-feels and this book had it spades....and I really need that right now.

This book was such a delight that I feel like I should buy a bunch of copies just to hand out to everyone.  I hadn't heard of Becky Albertalli before this, but I will definitely be reading her books in the future.",1518739200,4

THE CITY OF BRASS has some of the best fantasy world building I've ever read, along with compelling characters, an intriguing mystery, a dash of swoon-worthy romance, and roots in cultures that don't normally take center stage in fantasy. I mean, seriously, when was the last time you read a fantasy set in Egypt in the 19th century? On top of all this, the characters in THE CITY OF BRASS are some of the most complex and nuanced I've ever read. The book was constantly challenging my evaluations of specific characters, and keeping me guessing. If you are a fan of either adult or young adult fantasy (this one is adult, but I think has strong crossover appeal), I highly recommend THE CITY OF BRASS!!!",1518825600,5

Zara Cole's problems with authority and need for freedom made her run away from the hothouse environment of New Detroit to the Lower Eight where crime is rampant and everyone is out for themselves. She doesn't pay much attention to the big news of the day. The alien Leviathans are back to pick out a new crop of Honors to travel with them for a year as crew on their huge living spaceships. Zara is more concerned with finding her next mark and stealing enough to live on for the next few days.

Unfortunately, Zara's new mark is connected to a crime boss who wants what she stole and is willing to kill her to get it. Zora checks herself back into rehab for her antisocial tendencies in order get away but is tracked down. Luckily, she is picked to be one of the next hundred Honors and agrees in order to get off Earth and out of danger.

What Zara doesn't know is that teaming up with the Leviathan Nadim only changes the kind of danger that she will face. She and Beatriz, the second Honor on Nadim, need to be trained and pass tests before their one-year Tour. But Zara is anything but a rule follower and asks lots of questions of Nadim and about their mission.

I really enjoyed the world building in this story with huge sentient beings acting as spaceships. I liked that Zara was smart and suspicious but a good friend if you could gain her loyalty. I loved the relationship that developed between Zara and Nadim. I can't wait to find out what happens next for them in further books.

She was very selfish and kind of made fun of people (like Millie) who have things worse off than her. Her reasons for doing the Miss Clover City Beauty Pageant were horrible. She didn't take it seriously at all. I thought thered be more about the pageant itself, but there wasnt. There was also a horrible love triangle that I hated.

I was super excited for Jack's story because from what little we gathered about him in book one, I knew there was a whole lot more to the guy and I couldn't wait to see how Tessa would spin it.

Indecent Exposure has elements of forbidden romance - which always adds a fun angle to a romance novel, throw in a former Olympic medalist and an almost officer and you've got a few other little issues to work through.

Katie was such a fun heroine, she's tough, sassy, but she's also got real heart.  She is a good girl  usually, but she wants to use this american adventure to walk a little on the wild side - nothing too outrageous though.  But she doesn't expect to be drawn towards Jack.

Jack's got his own hang ups from his past, he recognizes in himself that he doesn't really have healthy sexual relationships - but something about Katie is different.  Jack is also having confusion about his decision to join the academy and his reasons for doing so.  I loved that there was a real hidden depth to him - I had expected it, but he was even better than I imagined.

I've enjoyed this series a lot, because of the relationships between Jack, Charlie, and Danika, and watching as their own personal lives expand when they discover the one meant for them.  Because of this I'm so anxious for the next book in the series.

If you want to read a book full of steam, romance, and just the right amount of angst and drama - pick up Indecent Exposure today and expose yourself to the pleasure of Tessa Bailey's officers and the women they can't stay away from.",1518825600,4
7039,435,930,"Munich is another fine historical novel from Robert Harris. He retells - and actually makes suspenseful - the well known story of the 1938 Munich agreement. The book does a good job of imagining to life the real life characters - the historical Chamberlain is humanized and somewhat sympathetic; Hitler remains enigmatic and fearsome.  In a well crafted narrative device, Harris tells the story from the alternating perspective of two fictional characters - one British (Hugh Legat) and one German (Paul von Hartmann)- both low level go-fers who nonetheless participate in the key events and interact with the real life characters.  Hugh and Paul had known each other at Oxford several years before the story and the nature and extent of their relationship is only slowly revealed by Harris as the plot unfolds.  Woven into the story of the Munich conference and adding the suspense is a fictional spy-novel plot involving Hugh, Paul and German opposition to Hitler.  All in all a great read.",1518825600,4

Mystery and mayhem are the best ways to describe this book. There are a lot of dark and mysterious things that are happening in this book, the first being Luciens father being found dead. Some suspect its a suicide while others speculate that something else might be going on. Its interesting, no doubt, but it wasn't necessarily a driving force for me. This book definitely reminds me a lot of J.R. Wards The Bourbon Kings. They share a ton of similarities, but I do think Armentrout has gone for a more explicit and sexier route.

7042,617,5,"We all have routines and ways we cope with the craziness of the world, but for Eleanor inEleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman, a small deviation from routine has some rather large and lasting effects.

Eleanor is a creature of habit, with precise timetables for various tasks, the foods she eats, and the events she attends (or more accurately doesn't). A bit of an outsider due to her tendency to state whatever she's thinking without regard for social niceties or emotional impact, Eleanor doesn't easily make friends. When her office computer needs repair, the new IT guy Raymond comes to help. As they head to their separate homes after work one day, they come across an elderly man, Sammy, who's fallen on the sidewalk. In assisting Sammy, Eleanor and Raymond are subsequently brought together time and time again in various social settings, helping each other, in their own ways, to escape the isolation of their respective lives.

Balancing heavy topics of trauma, depression, and general mental health with some levity in the observations and situations surrounding Eleanor, this novel demonstrates the complexities of the interior and exterior lives we lead and how juggling the two can sometimes require enormous effort. I have a love/hate relationship with Eleanor's obliviousness to what's going on around her - one side of it is definitely her defense mechanism to be able to function like a moderately ""normal"" human being (whatever that might be), which is entirely understandable, but the other side has me screaming internally for her to take a hint. I enjoyed the journey that Eleanor goes on throughout the book and was happy to see that she wasn't instantly cured, but that there's an ongoing process of recovery and self-realization taking place.",1518825600,4

I may not be able to be away from my desk for 17 minutes at a time but I am going to try to make it a point to at least get up and take a two minute break.

This book gives the back story of how the future Lord Commander of the Kings Guard and future King came to be the way they are.

7052,751,594,"Area X is a mysterious place where nature has reclaimed the Earth, and there are no signs of civilization. For decades, expeditions have been sent across the border to gather as much information as possible about this strange area, to map out the terrain and discover what caused this puzzling event. The twelfth expedition follows four women: an anthropologist, a surveyor, a psychologist, and a biologist. They have been trained to expect the unexpected, but what they discover in Area X changes everything they ever knew about the word, and about themselves.

I finished this book early this morning (around 2 AM). My girlfriend was asleep on me, and I didn't dare wake her up because she doesnt care about this book at all. I don't know of anyone whos read this book, so I was at a loss. I needed answers! I needed to converse! Im so confused!!!! I still do, and still am. I went to bed with more questions than answers, and a desperate desire to find bookish friends so I don't have to suffer alone.

Ill tell you what I can, though, about this incredible book. Annihilation is told in first-person from the biologists perspective; we never get her name. Though her husband was part of the eleventh expedition, which concluded mysteriously and fatally, thats not the reason the biologist volunteered. She and the other three women study Area X as directed, but nothing seems to go as planned, and soon the women cant trust each other, let alone themselves.

As a narrator, the biologist is entirely unreliable. We learn early on of a compromising moment, added to the fact that Area X is a mysterious place where nothing can be trusted, not even the people exploring it. The story is to be read as the biologists notebook, her detailed account of everything during her journey through Area X. Not only are first-person narrators unreliable, but here shes writing down her experiences, not just telling them. She even omits to leaving things out of her account. This only adds to the intrigue of the book, and its fascinating to follow the biologist on this journey.

The majority of the book is simply the biologists observations of Area X. If you're looking for an action-packed, dialogue-filled tale of treachery, you're way off base, here. The book predominately focuses on the landscape and the things the biologist studies and encounters. Maybe this sounds boring to you, but trust me, its notits suspenseful and creepy, and you probably shouldnt read it alone, at night, in the near-pitch dark. Seriously.

Its entirely too hard to explain what this book is about. My advice to you is to probably just read it, go into it with no information and let it take you where it takes you. Annihilation falls into this new genre called new weird, which is basically like a mixture of sci-fi, fantasy, and supernatural horror. Right up my alley. In fact, Jeff and his wife even compiled a book of short stories that serve as a kind of introduction to the new weird genre. I very much want to read it.

I hope to finish the trilogy soon, and hope to read more of VanderMeers works, as I really enjoy his writing. Its very beautiful and intelligent, and Id like to read as much of it as I can. For a book with less action than you may think, VanderMeer really knows how to keep up the suspense and creep you out.

Im not sure how else to explain this whirlwind of a book, but I highly recommend it and encourage you to read it. Hopefully book 2 will answer some of these questions I have.",1518825600,5

As you may know, the result is random (sort of). Thus the other way around is also true: the whole universe is drunk all the time! Damn, this even explains quantum mechanics? Sure. But this book is about the effects of a drunk universe in our ordinary lives. The bad news is: you don't need a drink to see randomness everywhere.",1518825600,4

I am so in love with this books accuracy in regards mythology! I know a bit, not a lot but a fair amount, and I have said this in Goodreads ( friend me if you haven't xD) it is so good! Like I totally remember facts that I knew but didn't remember as good. I am also playing God of War (1, 2, and 3) haha so I am on a myth rush! Which I love! Percy is quite nice as a character.

7057,514,234,"After seeing the TV series, I picked up the book. This is a case where the show is far better than the book. I bought one of Atwood's books years ago after seeing her speak. She's a lovely, gracious woman. Despite that I abandoned the book and would have done so with Handmaid's Tale if I hadn't seen the series and was desperate to find out its ending.

The TV series roughly follows the book where a young woman is used as a breeding machine in a dystopian society where women have lost all their rights. Bent on religious fervor, society yields to the rantings of a totalitarian government misquoting the bible. The ending was quite interesting and shows the depth of Atwood's research. However the writing was confusing and if I hadn't seen the show, I would've been lost. The book also could've used serious editing. Past and present tense are used interchangeably, words are either wrong or missing, sentences often awkward or nonsensical, and the story flip flops between present or past with barely any indication. There are however moments of depth and an excellent showing of the brainwashing of Offred. An okay read.

Watch the show and then read the book!",1518825600,3

But still xD it is like walking on the street and then a guy on a ban offers you Reeses, but what can happened, right?

7060,241,1868,"It's 1968, and Delphine is just eleven years old when she and her two younger sisters (Vonetta, age nine, and Fern, age seven), travel alone on an airplane from New York to Oakland, California, to see their mother Cecile, for the first time since Delphine was five.

Only Delphine has any real memories of their mother.

It's Delphine who tells the story, and Delphine who has to take responsibility for her sisters, even after Cecile picks them up at the airport. Cecile is cool, not at all motherly, and pays as little attention to them as possible. The girls long for the motherly affection and connection they've never had, and still don't have.

Instead, Cecile sends them off each day to Black Panther ""summer camp,"" at the community center. It's where they get breakfast, and it's where they get an education in black history, civil rights, and self-assertion that their father and grandmother, more laid-back and conservative personalities, never gave them.

Cecile is a poet, and she has a printing press, and to the Panthers she's ""Sister Anzilla."" (Spelling is a guess; I listened to the audiobook.) She has a somewhat testy relationship with the Black Panthers, happy to send the girls to them for breakfast, summer school, and other activities during their month-long visit, but a bit resentful when the Panthers want her to use her printing press for their flyers and newspaper.

What we see in this book is a view of the Black Panthers that, as a girl just about Delphine's age, but white, I certainly didn't get at the time.

And I love Delphine. I had just one younger sister, even younger than Fern, and like Delphine, in many ways I became responsible for her. At that age, you can manage many of the tasks, but the responsibility is more of a burden than adults, overworked themselves and not remembering what it felt like to be that age, often don't recognize. Delphine does her best, mostly does quite well--and gets chewed out when she makes a wrong choice, even though no harm came of it. I wanted to cheer when she spoke up for herself then!

It's a strange, crazy summer for the girls, especially Delphine, and they learn a lot and even, to some extent, start to find themselves as individuals.

Recommended.

7063,1120,512,"My second, and last, book on world war one. This one focuses on the first thirty days of the war. It has one of the best first chapters I have ever read, which perfectly sets the stage for the rest. Tuchmans writing is full of details that bring historical figures to life and relieve the relentless tension of the story. Given the more limited scope, the tone is different from the other one I read. I cant tell if it is because it was written by a woman v a man, or because of the time it was written, but I enjoyed the more unflinching portraits of the crucial players. I found the middle slow, but the pace really picks up in the last four chapters.",1518912000,4
7064,63,1062,"I loved this book. Devoured it in about 3 days. Had my hooked from the first page to the last.

Amber Patterson wanted more out of life. She hated that she was a nobody and things she think she deserved were not given to her. Then she set her sights on Jackson Parrish. He was a wealthy real estate mogul, with a beautiful wife Daphne and 2 daughters. Amber wanted to be Mrs. Jackson Parrish and she set her plan in motion. She learned all she could of the Parrish's. Who seemed to have the perfect life, but sometimes looks can be deceiving. Amber ""accidentally"" bumped into Daphne at the gym one day and they got to talking. Daphne's sister Julie had died from CF (which Amber knew) and she had a foundation she ran called Julie's Smile to help other families. Amber used this knowledge, saying that she too had a sister that died from CF, to become friends with Daphne. And she was able to make her way into the Parrish's home and unleash her plan to become the next Mrs. Parrish. But sometimes you need to be careful for what you wish for.

This first half of this book was told from Amber's point of view. Man was she an evil witch. All the conniving and plotting she was doing to get what she wanted. When she saw their house, man did her green eyed monster come out. All the while I kept thinking, OMG Daphne wake up. Stop being so gullible and letting her into your life.

The second half of the story was told from Daphne's point of view. And we got to see what was really going on in her life. Some of which I sort of figured from Amber's half. Some of the things in this half were they same as from Amber's but we got Daphne's view on it, and then I was like Okay, Alright LOL

The last part of the book, was both of their view and was just the icing on the cake to a great book.",1518912000,5

It is not the kind of book that you devour in large chunks.  It took me a while to finish.  I found the first third to be rather dry, but I think that was because I was trying to read it too quickly.  Once I slowed down, reading 10-15 pages at a sitting, I found myself more absorbed.  Although McKee talks about how to write a screenplay his advice translates very well to any kind of fiction writing.  McKees knowledge of film is extensive.  There is a long list of the films he references throughout the book at the back.  Although I did not know many of the films, he illustrates each of the story elements he talks about with one or more film examples, making them more concrete.

7067,1120,200,"I loved this book!  It has been a long time since Ive read something that I loved this much.  The story pitches an ordinary man, Robert, from London Above (essentially contemporary London) into London Below, a fantasy world where time is not linear but cleverly echoes real history.  It is a thriller as well.  The Lady Doors family has been killed and she wants revenge.  She, Robert, and the Marquis de Carabas dodge the assassins, that are now after her, while trying to find out who is behind the murders.  Despite the complexity of London Below (which feels like it is built on nostalgia), the story is easy to follow.  I think part of the reason that I loved the story so much is that it combines two things that I adore  London, and English History  into an imaginative, fantastical story.  I also read it right before I went to London so I was in the perfect frame of mind.  This is the second book Ive read by Gaiman and it definitely won't be the last.",1518912000,5

7071,1077,350,"Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights""is everything and then some. It is brilliant, mesmerizing, brutal, bestial, tinged with the supernatural and mystical, and above all else it is a masterpiece. It has so many layers to it, that it requires many readings. The writing is sublime and at times I had to put the book down and marvel at its greatness.

Heathcliff is a character like very few I have ever encountered, and Catherine (his childhood playmate and the love of his life) is in many ways his equal. They are devious, insulated lovers, and one cannot exist without the other, even after death has separated them.

This book has been analyzed in classrooms across the world. PHD students have written their thesis' on it, Hollywood turned it into a romantic myth, and the love between Heathcliff and Catherine has become part of cultural lore.

Yet, I doubt there will ever be any true consensus or interpretation of this magnificent piece of work because, like the works of Shakespeare, Byron, Joyce, and Conrad the characters live on far after one has finished reading about them. They live on in our minds and souls and we continue to struggle with their actions and behavior and beneath their gravestones we imagine their own personal struggles and demons have yet to be put to rest.

7072,650,370,"4.5 stars - look at that! I gave the lowest rating to the finale book in the prior Percy Jackson series and now I'm giving the highest rating of this series to the finale book. Riordan has improved greatly in his finale books, and I'm just so impressed.

This was such an exciting book. Full of action and adventure, comedy and love, deep characterization and just lots of excitement. It did take me a little bit longer to read, but once I finally sat myself down and concentrated, I couldn't stop reading it.

I had a few minor gripes with it (LIKE WHY DID WE HAVE TO ADD IN MORE NARRATORS BUT THEN I KIND OF DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE REYNA AND NICO WERE AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG). I didn't get too much Hazel and Frank in this one, and I felt like I would have loved a bit more from them since they were featured quite heavily in the beginning of the series. Jason was the King of Meh as usual.

Things that I loved? BABY COACH HEDGE...AND THEN HIS BABY. Omg, he was classic love as usual. LEOOOOOOOOO and his LOVE. Reynaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Nicoooooooooooooooooooo and his new love (please please please let that be a thing). So much actionnnnnnnnnnnn. I actually really enjoyed Piper and such quality evolution of her character over the series???? COACH HEDGE AND LEOOOOOOO. Ugh, there really was so much to love in this story.

I'm also quite pleased with the ending. I will admit it did wrap up a bit too quickly, but I thought it was still done quite well and I was pleased with it overall.

I don't want to say too much about it, so this will be a quick review. Overall, a fantastic end to the series that was much more enjoyable than most finales that I've read. It was a great way to wrap-up this series, and I'm super disappointed that I won't have more of this in my life.

7074,271,76,"Our hero, Rostov, has been sentenced, as an unrepentant aristocrat, to live forever under house arrest in the Hotel Metropol. He has assets, he has access to all of the Hotel's amenities, he is allowed guests, and he has, as they say in the travel business, ""the run of the house"". This is Eloise, with a mustache, on steroids. There's nothing at all wrong with that, (Rostov, after all, is more interesting than is Eloise), but a few pages in I dispensed with any serious consideration of actual Russian history, or of serious historical fiction generally, and just decided to go with the author's idiosyncratic walkabout.

The book has a slim plot in terms of anything dramatic happening. (The author's frequent references to ""Casablanca"" were markedly unconvincing.) The book does have a beginning and a middle and an end, but that's because time passes, and the passage of time is linear. There's not much in the way of dramatic tension or suspense, so there isn't a lot to resolve by the end. But, do you dismiss a Faberge Egg because you can't make an omelet with it? No, you do not. You treasure a Faberge Egg because it is beautiful and exquisite and a palpable example of inspired, painstaking, and detailed craftsmanship.

I liked the way Rostov thought, and mused, and in that regard he was amiable company. The character is given patience, and some degree of insight, and an open and flexible approach to the world - all of which allowed him to wander through his life being surprised and delighted by what happened to him. Can that sort of thing become boring and precious and pretentious? Well, sure. Can it also lead to the crafting of delightful aphorisms, elegant sentences, sparkling scene miniatures, and witty and sly conversations and observations? You bet.

So, to me there is a lot to read and enjoy here and a lot to skim over. (I just don't get writing about food. For crying out loud I'm eating an apple right now and no one's coming by later with foie gras, so spare me.) Rostov is about as wildly fictional as a fictional character can be, but if you know that going in this can be fun.

7078,189,267,"Part of this hugely inventive novel charts, separately, in very short chapters and in the urgent Historic Present, the lives of Marie-Laure LeBlanc and Werner Pfennig.  The novel follows the now modish fashion, which I find very irritating, of moving backward and forward in time.

Marie-Laure, born in 1928 in Paris, became blind at the age of six.  Her mother had died in childbirth; her loving father, Daniel, teaches her to see, using her fingers, training her memory. He is a locksmith employed at the Museum of Natural History, and his hobby is making small models, for example of the streets of their neighbourhood in Paris, which his daughter, using her fingers, can learn to navigate.  She absorbs information about the world, also from Braille books, which fascinate her. The author is brilliant as describing what it is like to make some sense of the world when you are blind.

Locked securely away in the Museum of Natural History is a valuable diamond, called the Sea of Flames, to which is attached a legend that anyone who owns it will not die, but that disasters will strike his family or friends.  People half believe the story.

When the war starts, the contents of the Museum are packed up and sent out of Paris; and then, in 1940, she and her father join the stream of civilians moving south.  Her father has taken the diamond with him.  And eventually they finish up in German-occupied St Malo, in Brittany, in the house of the fathers uncle, tienne, a strange man, disturbed by memories of the First World War, and house-bound for many years.  He knows all about radios, and has been broadcasting scientific educational programmes.  Daniel makes a model of St Malo for his daughter. Inside it, he hides the diamond. In 1941 he receives a telegram summoning him back to Paris.  He leaves Marie-Laure in the care of his uncle and the uncles housekeeper.  He has been denounced for measuring buildings oin St Malo, and, on the way to Paris, he is arrested and deported to Germany. When he does not return, Marie-Laure is bewildered and devastated.

Very reluctantly, tienne is drawn into the Resistance, which sends him code numbers. He then transmits them to the Allies.

Von Rumpel, a gemologist in the German military, whose job it was to record confiscated jewels, has heard of the diamond and is determined to track it down. He has a special personal interest in it since he is suffering from cancer. Somehow, (rather improbably), in 1944, he tracks the diamond down to St Malo and is sure that it is concealed in the model of tiennes house, if he can only find that model. He arrives in St Malo in August, two months after D-Day, while the town in after heavy Allied bombardment from the air and from the sea. He cannot find the model of the house because Marie-Laure keeps it on her person and is hiding behind a false wall.

Werner, born in 1927, lives in an orphanage at Zollverein, a mining town near Essen.  His father had been killed in the mines.  His hobby is making and repairing radio sets and inventing gadgets.  From tiennes broadcasts, and then from books, he absorbs scientific information which fascinates him.  (There is a lot about physics, geology and natural history in the book  Doerr writes columns about scientific books for the Boston Globe.)  Werners skill as a radio repairer gets him noticed by a high-up in the Nazi party, who saves him from going down the pit when he would reach 16, and instead gets the 14 year-old sent to a school of engineering in Saxony, where the boys are also given a brutal military training. A sadistic commandant devises ways of weeding out the weakest of the boys. He has them hunted down by the others, who are ordered to savage them.  Most do it with zest.  Repeatedly the commandant has them victimize a gentle friend of Werners, finally with terrible results.  Werner is appalled, but helpless.

But he is a great success as a student: he contributes to finding a way to track down the location of radio transmitters. Then, in 1942, still only sixteen, he is sent into the army which has need of his skills.  Initially he is sent to the Eastern Front, where his group neutralize many Russian transmitters.  But this scarcely affects the German retreat, and Werner finds himself in Vienna. There he receives a summons to St Malo: the Germans guess that a transmitter there is sending out messages, and Werner is the man to locate the site of the transmitter. So he, too, ends up in St Malo. He picks up the transmission  and recognizes the voice of tienne from the broadcasts he had listened to as a child. He locates the house, and sees Marie-Laure emerge from it.

So there they are, Werner, Marie-Laure and von Rumpel in the midst of the apocalyptic bombardment. Each of them, for one reason or another, is desperate, hungry, thirsty and dirty.

I have perhaps already given away rather more of the book than some readers would like  but if I described the dnouement, I would indeed be guilty of spoilers.  Suffice it to say that Werner and Marie-Laure meet, and not as enemies. But they spent less than a day together. There is no happy ending for the two of them.

And what exactly happened to the little model house and the diamond?  It scarcely becomes clearer in the penultimate part of the book, set in 1974, thirty years after the siege of St Malo.  As for the last part, set in 2014, I cant see the point of that at all.

At 544 pages, the book has its longueurs, especially in the febrile thoughts and memories of Marie-Laure, Werner and von Rumpel. I think there are some loose ends;  but on the whole it was a good read.",1518912000,4

This poor family and all the struggles they had. I also felt Angela's family were cold and really should have stepped up more to help out but I guess times were different then.

7083,31,650,"More often than not, when I finally read a book that was on my TBR for a long time, I want to kick myself for waiting so long. That's certainly the case with Marrying Winterborne. Lisa Kleypas is undoubtedly the queen of historical romance and I've loved everything she's written (that I've read so far anyhow). The fact that I let Helen and Rhys hang out on my bookshelves this long without reading their story makes me sad. But, it also gave me a chance to binge the third book and upcoming fourth books, so I can't be that upset with myself. There's nothing quite like a good LK HR binge.
Each time I pick up one of Lisa's books, I fall hopelessly in love with her characters  even when I'm convinced there's NO WAY she could make me fall for them. (*cough* Devil in Winter *cough*) Helen and Rhys were absolutely no exception. These two were amazing in their own right and even more so together. Helen was so strong and determined and is undoubtedly one of my new favorite HR heroines. Her choices and actions made me smile and, later on in the book, gave me ALL THE FEELS. Rhys was charming and thoughtful. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect from him after meeting him in Cold-Hearted Rake, but he was amazing, totally swoon-worthy and a new favorite book boyfriend.

I loved everything about Marrying Winterborne. It was lush and romantic, sweet and sexy. Helen and her sisters kept me entertained and I can't wait to get their stories, too. (Ok, by this point I've already read Pandora's, but anyhow...) I shipped Helen and Rhys so freaking hard, though if we're being totally honest, I was shipping them as far back as in Cold-Hearted Rake when I could just tell there was something brewing there. The Ravenels series just keeps getting better and I am here for it.

Each childs story ends in a climactic moment, a cliff hanger.  Only in the final scene do you find out what happened to each.

7088,494,1857,"With an Ann Aguirre book, you know you are going to get a very strong, stubborn, damaged, 'comes out fighting from the wrong side of town' protagonist and this is no exception.  Partnering her with a syrupy sweet Disney Princess for a secondary character (Bea) is always going to be problematic if she overbalances our diamond in the rough Zara. Add in a third main character, a sentient alien ship with a 'male' personality, and you can probably guess where this YA will go.  Fortunately, there is no romance so much as 'bonding' in this first in the series and the focus is on the action, adventure, and discovery.

Story: In a future Earth that was saved by an alien species resembling starships, Zara Cole has chosen to live as a petty thief in the bowels of Detroit - in a lawless area that gives absolute freedom but no guarantees of survival. When she chooses the wrong mark - a ganglord's daughter - she has a choice few will get: become an honor and travel in an alien ship or face the ganglord's wrath. The obvious choice made, she is partnered with Beatriz and both become honors aboard the alien ship Nadim.  Zara is never one to let sleeping dogs lie and soon uncovers hard truths about their alien saviors.

Honor Among Thieves is a quick read with plenty of adventure and thrilling moments.  Zara has to survive and triumph over hard moments and unexpected life threatening issues all the while learning to bond with the ship in which they live.  Her shipmate Beatriz is also an 'honor' - the elite chosen to live inside the alien ships for a one year tour of duty exploring alien cultures. But unlike Zara, Beatrice is a highly accomplished and musical Brazilian scholar.  The two women hit it off - Bea relying on Zara's strength and Zara relying on Bea's skills.  Together, they learn to embrace their young liveship, Nadim.

Of course, conspiracies, mistakes, emergencies, and more will constantly test the two honors.  There are also plenty of smoking guns alluding to the liveships having more in mind than just saving humanity from itself.  By the end of this first book, a lot will be discovered and a lot will wait to be answered about the Leviathans and their true goals in suddenly showing up and saving humanity from destroying itself and its Earth.

If the plot seems familiar (girl bonds with and (probably falls in love with) AI/alien spaceship), it's because there have been several in the last two years alone that I've read.  In this case, though, the focus is on the danger and discovery rather than the romance.  Yes, the 'bonding' between Zara and Nadim is obviously going to turn into something more later in the series.  But at least there is a storyline here and not something tagged on to flesh out yet another soppy YA romance.

Problematic for me is believability.  Out of millions of people on the Earth, it's hard to believe they couldn't find better candidates who also exhibit strong survival skills than Zara Cole, who is obviously going to be a problem.  Of course, she becomes a bit of a unique snowflake that will answer all the issues the Leviathans are having with the Honors in her deep bond with Nadim, who is also a bit of a unique snowflake among his kind.  Even accomplished Bea is suspicious - more there because she's a perky Disney Heroine type rather than because out of millions or billions in the world, she was most desirable for the Honors program.  If you can set aside the disbelief, you can run with the story and just enjoy it.

Aguirre is never one to shy away from torturing her heroine and there is a lot of that here.  All on Zara, however (injuring Bea would have been akin to kicking a puppy, I think). Nor will the hero survive unscathered - I have to appreciate that Aguirre is willing to torture both hero and heroine to further the story.  I am not familiar with author Caine's work so I can't comment there; suffice it to say that Razorlands fans will find much of the same here and much to enjoy in the same way.

In all, I found Honor Among Thieves to be surprisingly enjoyable and look forward to the next book in the series.  Reviewed from an advance reader copy provided by the publisher.",1518912000,4
7089,1071,177,"There's no way for me to explain the one star without spoiling the book. I normally wouldn't bother, but I waited a week and I'm still angry at this author, so I'm going to try to explain.

This book starts nicely. It's not earth shattering, but seems like a good mysterious fantasy for the reader to invest in, and it continues that way for 90% of the book. We don't know if these are dual lives or how those dual lives would work out, and if they aren't dual lives which one is real? How will they merge if they do? We're led to believe at first that the bookseller is one helluva dreamer, though it quickly becomes clear that's not the case. I was interested to see how this would all shake itself out, and I had high hopes for realistic fantasy based in a time not that far gone where we could understand the cultural norms without a lot of work on anyone's part: author or reader. I didn't think it would be Pulitzer great, but a nice diversion.

Unfortunately none of my questions were answered because the author uses an unrealistic cop-out to get herself out of the hard work of writing a novel's ending. It's very much akin to ""then we all woke up and learned it was a dream"" except it's less realistic and does a disservice to the devices she does use. This is nearly impossible to explain without spoilers, but I at least I've exorcised my own demons.",1518912000,1

7093,1120,284,"I have to admit, this book was not what I expected. It is a straightforward retelling of many tales from Norse Mythology, told by Neil Gaiman. Ive read some of these tales before. The stories are good, some amusing, some terrifying, and in some places you can hear Gaimans voice. But I expected more. More of his signature humor and perspective. If you like Mythology this is a good introduction to the Norse tales. But if you are just a Gaiman fan, its not necessarily worth the time.",1518912000,3

The story is action packed, the heroine stubborn, plain, and down to earth, and there are some supernatural elements that keep things interesting.

7095,63,819,"The first third of this book was more like a 3 stars for me, but then boy did the suspense start and as the book went on it just more intense and jumped to 4 - 4 1/2 stars.

Anna Fox is a former child psychologist that lives alone (She is separated from her husband and daughter). She has Agoraphobia, which is a fear of being outside in the wide open world. She is on lots of medication and drinks way too much wine (she buys it by the case) and is an old black and white movie buff. Like in the Rear Window, she watches her neighbors (okay spies on them lol). Then new people move in across from her, the Russells (Allistor, Jane and their son Ethan) and they become the focus of her attention. But then one night she sees something, but no one believes her (not her Dr or even the police). Did she really see what she thought she did? Or are her medication & booze making her hallucinate? Is she a danger to herself or from someone else?

For me the first third of the book was a bit slow. I couldn't wait for all the suspense to happen. But I still did enjoy it. I think the author did a great job of creating the world that Anna lives in. The description of her house and even the thoughts in her mind really made Anna come to life. Anna does gets visits from her Dr, her PT and she also has a tenant that lives in the basement. She also plays online chess, and gives out advise to others on a website that is for people with the same phobia as her.

And once the suspense started, this book book went from somewhat confusing and slow, to I don't want to put it down. I figured out one of the things pretty early ( but even when it was revealed it still got me though) But a bunch of the other twists and turns I did not see coming. I was suspecting everyone and changing my mind on what I thought happened a few times lol. As the book got closer and closer to the end I was on the edge of my seat.",1518912000,4

I love this series, which is set in San Francisco. Each book is a standalone, although if you enjoy contemporary romance, you will end up wanting to read them all. In addition to the San Francisco location, I particularly enjoy the group of friends that feature in this series and the building complex, comprised of both businesses and apartments, where they live and interact. I want to go there and I want to be part of their group. As is standard for this series, this book made me both laugh and cry happy tears. This one also had a bit of a thrilling mystery. I loved Joe and Kylie, as individuals and as a couple. I highly recommend this!",1518912000,5
7097,881,17,"'The Duchess Deal', is the first Regency romance I have read in a couple of years. A clever mix of humour and poignancy laced through with sensual romance, Ash and Emma's story is the perfect weekend read.
The Duke of Ashbury's reclusive life is disturbed when desperate seamstress, Emma demands payment for his ex- fiancee's  wedding gown. From their first meeting, you can tell that Emma is a strong, independent woman, ready to defy convention and risk all to ensure her survival. Ashbury believes her intrusion to be serendipitous and wastes no time in making her an unlikely offer, he is brusque, haughty and hurting and the marriage of convenience he proposes riddled with rules designed to protect his already battered heart and self-esteem.
The couples unlikely romance is aided and abetted by  Kahn, the butler and Mary, the ladies maid and indeed the whole of the Duke's staff at his London residence. They want to see the Duke happy and believe Emma is the perfect match for him.
Painfully disfigured from a  horrific war injury Ashbury's prickly nature is exacerbated, he shuns society and human contact and has only allowed the marriage of convenience to get an heir; enabling him to honour his father's memory and fulfil his duty to his tenants. Emma sees the man beneath the scars, moved by his sense of responsibility and caring nature. Falling in love will make her vulnerable and is something she cannot afford to risk but is it already too late?
The plot has good pacing, the necessary twists and lots of humour, which counterbalance the angst the couple experience, as they battle their internal demons and external nemeses to get their happy ever after.
Emma's friendship with an unusual set of ladies gives her courage as she fights to understand her complicated husband, I look forward to reading about their lives in later books.
The Duchess Deal is an engaging, lively, sensual Regency romance with delightfully flawed, likeable characters and a lovely balance of laughter, kisses and tears.

7098,1059,1697,"This was another book that caught me with the cover alone. I had seen it on some of the book sites, and the description sounded cool, but it was the cover that caused me to grab it up and put it in my cart! And I think there may be something wrong with me . . . I was so attracted to the villain in this book! Liam was my favorite character from the beginning. The whole time that Jules pines over Roan, Im sitting here yelling, why?? Liam is right there and hes sooo much better!! But of course, Jules didn't listen to me. Jules is one of those girls that doesnt listen to anyone, who does her own thing, and sometimes that turns out well, other times it doesnt. Thats why I gave Everless 4 stars, because Jules ends up making some dumb decisions that really screwed her up when they really shouldnt have. But I loved the setting, the story was interesting, the mystery kept me turning the pages, and most of the characters were intriguing. And look, its another series! Why do I keep doing this to myself?? And there isn't even a publication date on Goodreads for the next book . . . Im never gonna make it. Aside from that, this is a great book and a good one for teens to help get them into reading. I would recommend this book to anybody.",1518912000,4
7099,266,737,"This is the first of the series of books by Durrell on which the recent PBS series was based.  I read them out of order, but no matter.

What a lucky boy to have lived such a childhood roaming nearly untethered on a Greek island.  He was smart, of course, and already was focused on the wildlife that remained his interest for the balance of his life.  He prospered.

The story is funny and light without being fatuous.  So funny.  I rarely laugh aloud, but did at certain scenes in this book.

Durrell shows a remarkable ability to remember detail and feelings from many years prior to writing this book.  He perhaps doesn't show that 'child's wonder' that reviewers comment on, but he can remember the excitement and sense of discovery.  As a youth, Durrell seems to show remarkable unflappability when meeting convicts, priests or doctors.

7108,237,1829,"The first half, approximately, of STONER reads like a summary. Therefore, it is quite dull. The second half, approximately, isn't much better, but it IS better. At least characters do a little more talking.

Essentially, this is a story of a boy, then a man who goes through life not defending himself and, with rare exceptions, choosing to do what others want rather than what he wants. It is a frustrating story that even gets disgusting when he allows his hateful wife to take over the life of their child.

STONER, written in the 1960s, is praised as the most beautiful book in the world and almost perfect and, now, even has a 50th anniversary edition. Must be good,  right? Thats what I thought. But I found it to be otherwise, although it might have been better if I read it with no expectations, if I had ignored that over-the-top admiration.

7112,319,1847,"January 12, 1888 was a date that lived in infamy for many settlers that lived in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska.  On that date they awoke to an abnormally warm winter day.  After many days of bitter cold, this seemed like the perfect day to do outdoor chores and attend school.  What they didn't know was that a cold artic wind was blowing down from Canada that would drop the temperature as much as 70 to 80 degrees in some areas to forty below zero.  This came along with an ice driven blizzard and it arrived just when many of these children were walking home after school on the open prairie.

The Childrens Blizzard tells the personal tales of the immigrants who moved to the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska area and their brutal voyages overseas.  It also talks about the early days of the weather service.  Then the book tells the personal stories of many people on January 12th, 1888, and follows the aftermath.

The immigration stories following two main groups on their way from Norway and from the Ukraine were fascinating.  It made me realize how lucky I am that my own ancestors survived the journey over as even during the latter half of the nineteenth century, it was still common for 10% of immigrants to die on the boats over.

I didn't realize there was a weather prediction service in the 1880s, so reading about how it worked was fascinating to me. Although I think its a little harsh to totally blame the weather service.  In that day even if they would have gotten their warnings out via telegraph and hosted the cold wave flags, most of the people affected by the storms did not live close enough to see the flags and with no phones or means of communication, its hard to think it would have made a difference.

The varying personal stories of the day of the blizzard haunted me.  After I read the story of poor school boy Walter, I couldn't stop thinking about it all day . . . and Walter has been dead for a long time!  There were so many tales of bravery, sacrifice, and just plain sadness.  It was nice that these real people are still remembered.

I also enjoyed that one of my favorite books, The Long Winter by Laura Ingalls Wilder was discussed.  The Long Winter was not the winter of 1888, but 1880 and Larkin verifies that Wilder captures what others experienced that winter in vivid prose.  Her descriptions describe what many others recorded in their journals and diaries in the winter of 1880.  Laura Ingalls Wilder made the Snow Winter the subject of her novel The Long Winter.  Every detail in the book matches up exactly with the memoirs of the pioneers: the grinding of wheat in coffee mills, the endless hours of twisting prairie hay for fuel, the eerie gray twilight of the snowed-in houses, the agony of waiting and hoping that the trains would get through, the steady creep of starvation when they failed to yet again.

I enjoyed the style of writing this non-fiction book.  I cared for the real characters and their stories felt alive.  It was a book that I have been telling everyone about and that I will think about long after Ive read it.  The only negative I had about this book is that there were so many characters to follow, I sometimes got lost in the details.  And I like big and complicated books!  I think maybe having a section at the beginning like some novels do with a list of the real people in the book and how they are related would have been helpful.

Favorite Quotes:

On January 12, 1888, a blizzard broke over the center of the North American continent.  Out of nowhere, a soot gray cloud appeared over the northwest horizon.  The air grew still for a long, eerie measure, then the sky began to roar and a wall of ice dust blasted the prairie.  Every crevice, every gap and orifice instantly filled with shattered crystals, blinding, smothering, suffocating, burying anything exposed to the wind.  - Opening Lines

Chance is always a silent partner in disaster.

God inflicted ten plagues on the Egyptians to punish them for refusing to free the Israelites, but with the settlers of the North American prairie He limited himself to three:  fire grasshoppers, and weather.

Out on the frontier, working children made the difference between surviving and going under.

I am tired of talk that that comes to nothing . . .. You might as well expect the rivers to run backwards as that any man who was born a free man should be contented when penned up and denied liberty to go where he pleases.  - Chief Joseph at his surrender.

Under the banners of civilization and Christianity there have been committed wrongs against the Indian that must cause the most hardened man to blush with shame, wrote Woodroof in 1881

Its time for us to acknowledge of Americans greatest mistakes, wrote Nicholas D. Kristof on the op-ed page of the New York Times, a 140-year-old scheme that has failed at a cost of trillions of dollars, countless lies and immeasurable heartbreak:  the settlement of the Great Plains.  very controversial.  Its an interesting topic to debate.

Overall, The Childrens Blizzards is a fascinating look into a heartbreaking chapter of our nations history.

7114,333,1871,"We need to talk about Kevin by Lionel Shriver was recommended by the librarian at the Anaheim Public library. I read the book a few months ago, but recent events motivated me to post a review.

There was a waiting list for the book at the library, so I found the 2011 movie on Netflix. I was captivated, enthralled and terrified by the movie and wondered if the book could be better. After all, there it was, what was hidden for so long in the movie, right there on page 12. Well the book was so much better than the movie.

Since the secret comes out so early in the book, I will discuss it, but if you want to watch the movie, stop reading right now.

Kevin is a murderer, a killer of schoolchildren, a child with a troubled past, and a mother.

The book is the anguishing story of his mother as she struggles throughout his life. As much as she loved him, Kevin was a mystery. She tried therapy, treatment, discipline, all with limited success. Kevin was a spy, a manipulator, a paradox. He refused to talk, refused to participate, and deliberately antagonized people.  He enjoyed eavesdropping on the unwitting and manipulating the unsuspecting. Everyone needed to talk about Kevin, but no one had answers.

In the movie, Kevins mother struggles with the aftermath of Kevins deed which is a secret, revealed only toward the end. In the book, the killings are revealed early so readers develop a relationship with Kevins mother. We agonize along with her, knowing what happened, and observing her trauma and pain as well as his lack of it.

This book and/or the movie should be on everyones must read list, especially in light of recent events. We all need to talk about Kevin.",1518998400,5
7115,599,819,"This was a really good book that I could hardly put down! Anna is such a well developed,  flawed character; agorophobic, alcoholic, regularly abuses her medications. Her reasons, and her guilt about the accident she was involved in have ruined her career as a child psychologist. She does counsel people in an internet group chat room, which probably isn't a good idea.
Anna watches her neighbors from her windows, and sees what she believes to be a crime committed. The police doubther story for many reasons. Out of fear and concern for the son in the home where she saw the crime, Anna befriends him, and lets him into her home and heart. Her concern about the neighbor's family was not incorrect, but very misguided. How this all plays out and is discovered makes for a very dark and interesting story.",1518998400,5
7116,479,540,"I went into this book expecting greatness, honestly. A book about fandoms, anxiety, and being a child of the internet? You already know I can get behind all of that. Plus, a romance that forms through written correspondence? MY LITERAL FAVORITE TROPE? Sign me up!  Unfortunately, though, Eliza wasn't quite everything I hoped it would be.

I made Monstrous Sea because it's the story I wanted. I wanted a story like it, and I couldn't find one, so I created it myself.

 Eliza Mirk 
Eliza herself was the reason this was a 3.5-star read for me instead of a 5-star one. Literally, every single problem I had with this book? Eliza. Dont get me wrong, shes not unredeemable  she portrays fantastic anxiety rep that I related really well to, and her affinity for the webcomic she has created and its subsequent fandom reaches levels of love that I think a lot of us can understand. Shes immensely talented and a perfectionist to the point that she feels like she needs to work on her creations constantly, which is also a feeling I can get behind (hello, type A personalities!).

Broken people don't hide from their monsters. Broken people let themselves be eaten.
 miscommunications & angst 
I don't want anyone thinking Im over here holding teen characters to unfair standards. I genuinely don't mind when YA protagonists get irrationally angry at their families, or don't want to spend time with their siblings, or lash out at friends and love interests usually. Eliza, unfortunately, takes it to a new level.

Her parents are a little bit inept and don't have great communication, but it felt like the portrayal of their relationship was, in a sense, saying, Its okay to treat your parents like trash no matter how hard they try, because even if they try to understand you, they're never going to! Weve all seen bad parents in YA, but the Mirks arent. They mess up, and they're human, but they're trying, and the biggest issue is, hands down, a lack of communication. While Elizas behavior is perfectly common for teens  especially those struggling with mental health issues  it doesnt feel like its addressed or correctly quickly or well enough to justify its intensity.

You found me in a constellation.
 Wallace Warland 
The brightest spot in this book? Wallace, hands down. Hes the sort of character that you peg as the love interest from the moment he walks on to the page, but its hard to guess that he could be so adorable and wounded. He struggles from tremendous amounts of grief, as well as PTSD, and it manifests through his inability to speak out loud around most people (which is where the written correspondence trope gets its chance to shine). He is caring, kind, and so lovable, and honestly deserved better than some of the mess that Eliza put him through.

There is a scene towards the end of the book  I won't spoil it, but if youve read it, you know the one  where Eliza gives Wallace a terrible scare, and his reaction had me unexpectedly sobbing because he is so desperately afraid of his past repeating itself before his eyes. He was easily the character that I connected the most to, emotionally, and by the time I turned the final page, I just wanted so much more time with him.

Maybe thats normal. The things you care most about are the ones that leave the biggest holes.
 Monstrous Sea 
One of the things I found most interesting about the book, I have to mention here: the art and snippets from Elizas webcomic, Monstrous Sea, that we get to see here and there throughout the story. The art was so fun, and it was a really nice touch that made the webcomic feel like a real-life thing  I half-expected that I would be able to go to the URLs listed and find a full, thriving forum there for a fandom Id never known existed. The storyline snippets, on the other hand, I thought were a little dull, and didn't form a cohesive enough mini-story to bother with trying to follow closely, but Im happy I got the physical formatting for the illustrations alone.

 final thoughts 
At the end of the day, I gave this book 3.5 stars, but rounded up to 4 for the star rating's sake. If you enjoy books that reference internet fandoms and online friends, as well as some really solid anxiety rep, I highly recommend this book, unless you have a problem with angsty, self-absorbed main characters. If you think thats a feature that youd find yourself unable to get past, as I know is the case for many people, Id pass on this one.",1518998400,4

The story was pretty good and the main characters were fully developed and most were likable.

7119,56,903,"This might turn out to be one of my favorite books of all time. I feel like there was so much to love. I don't care if he was just cashing in on the success of the Jurassic Park movie. Im not even mad that Malcolms death was retconned. What Im mad about, is that Hollywood took a beautiful book and hacked it into pieces and tried to dazzle us with animatronic dinosaurs. Okay so I like animatronic dinosaurs too, but still- there was no need.

The plot is this: Dr. Levine suspects something happened that involved Dr. Ian Malcolm in Costa Rica six years ago. Of course, Malcolm denies it because NDAs and all that. But he says: Get me physical proof of a dinosaur Lost World and Ill help you on your Costa Rican dinosaur expedition. So Levine snoops and snoops and eventually gets Malcolm the evidence he required. Dinosaur chaos ensues. Meanwhile, those bad guys over at Biosyn still want all the Dino tech for themselves, so they are in the distant background doing bad stuff.

The science: I found all Malcolms musings on Chaos theory and order absolutely fascinating. Crichton makes it very accessible to the reader in a way that is thought provoking but also not difficult to understand. Im glad he was resurrected because truth be told, hes a much more interesting character than Dr. Grant.

Sarah Harding. Shes basically Wonder Woman. I want to be Sarah Harding when I grow up. She is an example of a female heroine done right. Im sad she was written by a man but Crichton did her justice. Shes strong. Shes brave. She knows what she wants and she goes and gets it. She is not a damsel in distress, and at NO point in this novel does she require rescuing from the men. In fact, they quite frequently needed rescuing from her. And that scene with Dodgson? Absolutely priceless. Her relationship with Kelly was perfect and I adored her for it. Kelly becomes a little Sarah Harding in her own right.

Were there as many dinosaurs in this as in Jurassic Park? No. Did I mind? No. The characters and the story of their survival took front and center here and it was fantastic. I sort of think of it like I think of Spielbergs production/direction strategy. Less is more. A ripple in a puddle. A thump in the distance. The threat is always there, but you cant always see it. Its your imagination that makes the horror real.

The action scenes were all edge of your seat thrill rides. The classic trailer on the cliff scene was done much better in the book. The presence of children on the island heightened the suspense.

My only word of warning: if you liked the movie before, youll probably be disappointed in it by the time you're done reading The Lost World. Read it anyway. Its worth it.",1519084800,5
7120,275,1872,"A very atmospheric novel, Sunburn by Laura Lippman is an intriguing mystery that unfolds at a leisurely pace.

After walking out on her husband, Polly Costello meets Adam Bosk at the High-Ho diner/bar in Belleville, DE. Neither is planning on staying in town for long, but after meeting one another, they each decide to town for the time being. Polly is hired as a waitress at the High-Ho but she only plans on staying until she builds up a nest egg before moving on.  Adam is hired temporarily as a cook at the High-Ho and he continues trying to inveigle his way into Pollys life.  Neither of them are forthcoming about how or why they ended up in Belleville and in fact, Adam knows more about Polly than he lets on.  Over the next several months, Adam and Pollys relationship deepens beyond co-workers but will Pollys very colorful past prevent them from building a future together?

Polly is charming and sexy but she is also quite reserved and maintains an emotional distance from everyone in her life. She easily walks away from her present life and she does not offer anyone an explanation for her actions. She is somewhat mysterious and less than forthcoming with the new people she meets in Belleville but she is surprisingly popular with the customers at the High-Ho. Polly does not make female friends which makes for a distant but mostly cordial relationship with Cath, who also works at the High-Ho.

Adam has good reasons for cozying up to Polly and he remains quite vague when anyone asks him personal questions about his life. He is quite fascinated with Polly but he knows he should  not become too close to her.  Before long, Adams interest in her has crossed from professional to romantic, but he convinces himself he can maintain his objectivity. But is Adam fooling himself with his assertions that his feelings for her won't interfere with his real reasons for being in Belleville?

Sunburn is a character-driven, multi-layered novel. Polly definitely has an interesting back story, but she is sometimes hard to like or feel sympathetic towards when the truth about her past comes to light. Adam is an experienced professional but he greatly underestimates how deeply Polly will affect him. Laura Lippmans  slow parceling of information about Pollys past culminates with a dramatic confrontation. The novel comes to an unexpected conclusion that is rather poignant. Film buffs will especially appreciate the nod to some classic noir movies from the 40s and 50s.

7121,652,1872,"Two men, more added on, one woman, many lies and a lot of deceit.

SUNBURN has your brain burning to find out what is really going on.

Polly has just left her husband, Gregg, and her daughter, Jani, while they were at the beach.  She had it planned, but we don't know why.

Gregg was ready to leave the marriage, but Polly took off first.

Adam is also mysterious because we don't know what he is up to since he showed up at the same time Polly did and decided to hang around and work at the same place Polly found a job.

The suspense continues non-stop as secrets come out and Polly keeps manipulating and planning.  She has a secret she won't tell and things she needs to take care of.

Surprises continue to pop up, and the intrigue intensifies as Polly continues to secretly and mysteriously do what she does best.

Wow...Ms. Lippman has outdone herself with this book.

Absolutely loved it...the entire storyline and ending were great!!

Ms. Lippman has written another psychological page turner which is going to be a favorite.

SUNBURN is truly a masterpiece of suspense!! One of her best. 5/5

7122,248,1872,"Terrific.  Polly's got a secret and so does Adam.  Actually, Polly's got a lot of secrets and while Adam knows some of them, he doesn't know them all.  Polly also doesn't know that Adam has been hired to track her down.  One of the best things about Lippman (and there are many) is that her plots are intricate but never too hard to follow and they always come together in the end.  Polly's a lot like that too, and you'll wonder how far out she plans things.  It's hard to categorize this as it's not a mystery, it's not really psychological suspense, and it's not really a thriller. It's really fascinating though.  While this is set in Delaware = an hour from the beach- and not in Baltimore, those of us who are from the area will recognize some of the same touches which actually encompass both areas.  This is told from several points of view and that, I think, adds to the story because the reader sometimes knows more than the narrator and sometimes less.  Polly, despite at root being pretty rotten, is actually sympathetic but I suspect you'll like Adam more.  Keep an eye on Cath; there's more to her than you think.  Also, love the title, which is drawn from a very early scene. Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  Highly recommend this one.  ]",1519084800,5
7123,69,1872,"Laura Lippman pays homage to noir fiction in ""Sunburn,"" a story about a woman who is very good at getting what she wants.  The novel opens in the sleepy town of Belleville, Delaware, in 1995.  Thirty-eight year old Adam Bosk, a handsome PI, is hired to keep an eye on Polly Costello, a seductive redhead who may have pulled off a lucrative scam.  Adam's client, Irving Lowenstein, is an insurance broker who has skirted the law himself on more than one occasion. No one would mistake Adam for Albert Einstein; his libido leads him astray, and he ignores obvious warning signs that might have induced him to tread carefully.

Polly has a grim past.  She is determined to start over, but doing so will require stealth, patience, and cunning, all of which she possesses in abundance.  Even after she and Adam embark on a passionate affair, Polly keeps her eyes on the prize, and she will allow no one, not even the man she cares for, to stand in her way.  Most of Lippman's characters are self-centered, greedy, and mean-spirited.  They manipulate others, commit criminal acts, and do whatever is necessary to further their own interests. Adam is a decent guy, and even Polly has positive attributes that are not immediately apparent.  However, her ex-husbands, especially the first one, are contemptible, and she has paid a hefty price for her terrible taste in men.

""Sunburn"" is a bleak tale in which references to tragic events and the author's use of foreshadowing create a somber mood.  Lippman depicts Belleville as an unappealing place, where no one with ambition would dream of settling down. Although Polly may never have it all, it is clear that she intends to do whatever is necessary to come out on top.  The plot has lapses in logic, but Lippman's writing is proficient, involving, and fast-paced enough to hold our interest. Polly--a worthy descendent of the hard-boiled dames of yore--is savvy, opportunistic, and as conniving as those who are determined to bring her down.",1519084800,4
7124,612,1872,"Favorite Quotes:

Men have always done things for her It is a special art, asking people to do things, yet making it seem as if you never asked at all but its the skill she was given, the hand she has to play.

Cath couldn't find her way out of a room with no walls.

In her black dress, black gloves, and retro heels, she looks like Joan Crawford or Bette Davis.  She feels like them too.  Tough, yet brittle.  Thats the thing about being really hard.  When you do break, you shatter.

My Review:

I was immediately sucked into the powerful vortex of this enthralling and cleverly paced tale.  Written from the third person omniscient point of view, the storylines were fully textured, multi-layered, and ingeniously crafted.  The characters were all hues of shady and mysterious while endlessly fascinating and alluring.  But Ms. Lippmans superlative writing tops all other elements as it was first class and kept me riveted and resentful of interruption.  I despised the need for sleep and begrudgingly put my book down only when necessary.  This author is a recent discovery for me and I am greedy to amass and hoard all of her mesmerizing arrangements of words.",1519084800,5
7125,844,1872,"From the publisher:  Laura Lippman returns with a superb novel of psychological suspense about a pair of lovers with the best intentions and the worst luck:  two people locked in a passionate yet uncompromising game of cat and mouse. But instead of rules, this game has dark secrets, forbidden desires, inevitable betrayals - - and cold-blooded murder.  One is playing a long game. But which one?  They meet at a local tavern in the small town of Belleville, Delaware. Polly is set on heading west.  Adam says hes also passing through.  Yet she stays and he stays - - drawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him.  Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair.  Still, each holds something back from the other - - dangerous, even lethal secrets.  Then someone dies.  Was it an accident, or part of a plan?  By now, Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each others lives and lies that neither one knows how to get away - - or even if they want to.  Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them?  Something - - or someone - - has to give.  Which one will it be?

Part One of this book, headed Smoke [Part Two is headed Fire]  finds  Mark, 38 years old, who spots Polly, a [sunburned] redhead well into her thirties . . . sitting on a barstool, forty-five miles inland, in a town where strangers seldom stop on a Sunday evening.  They are both in a bar-slash-restaurant, the High-Ho.  He is a handsome private detective, guy who, in his downtime, likes to hunt deer [Bow and arrow] who takes a job as a short order cook at the High-Ho.  The redhead who has grabbed his attention takes a job there as a barmaid.  When he asks for her name, the response she gives him is Polly Costello. The reader soon discovers that she is also Pauline, who has left her husband and three-year-old daughter.  She and Gregg had met when she was 31, married quickly when she discovered she was pregnant, but the marriage went bad just as quickly when his abusive nature became very apparent. Her name had been Pauline Ditmars, then Pauline Hansen when she married Gregg, then Pauline Smith when she left him and their daughter.  Now living as Polly Costello.  One night soon after a short, squat woman with a butch haircut comes into the High-Ho and Mark knows instantly that shes a private investigator and that shes looking for the woman whos calling herself Polly Costello.  Since thats what he himself is doing there.  Both the woman, Sue, and Mark have each been hired to track her down.  Although a risky plan, Mark and Polly very shortly become intimately involved.  Mark has been hired to find the woman who left her husband [a dirty cop, btw] and her child in the lurch then stole money from the kid when the guy died, and disappeared with the life insurance.  So no one here has a clear conscience.  But when Pollys friend, Cath, goes to Pollys apartment looking for her, and dies when the apartment blows up, there is a lot for the ensuing investigation to find.  No one here looks very innocent.

The novel is but the latest where the reader gets to know the characters, to the point where one would like to meet her/him off the page, in real life as it were, and get to know them better, such a wonderful job having been done by this author in their creation.  The same could be said about this book as a whole, keeping the reader turning pages more and more quickly.  Highly recommended.",1519084800,5
7126,319,1872,"A mysterious woman with a past and a detective hired to track her, these two threads of the story lead to a riveting tale to uncover the secrets of the past.  Polly has appeared at a roadside diner and Adam appears shortly thereafter.  They both get a job at the diner, one as a waitress, and one as a cook and their love interest simmers through the summer.  Adam finds he cant keep away from Polly, but what is her true story?  Is she a murderer or a victim?

I enjoyed how the story unraveled over time and kept me guessing until the end.  There were many threads to this story and I really enjoyed how they were all revealed over time.  I liked the setting, although it did take me a bit to realize it was set twenty years in the past. Ill admit, I didn't enjoy this as much as Ive enjoyed previous Laura Lippman books.  I had a hard time getting into it and I had a hard time caring about Polly.  The characters were well developed, but she was so much of an enigma, I found myself not caring for her much.  And at the end of the book I was left thinking, what the heck just happened?

Favorite Quotes:

No one chases a waterfall.  You go for a swim and next thing you know, the current catches you and throws you right over.

June leaves her parents in the den, watching Murder She Wrote.  She worries a little about the watching crime shows, but it was always their favorite program.  Maybe its a good sign that they still want to visit Cabot Cove and follow J.B. Fletcher on her various trips.  Murder in J.B. Fletchers world is almost gentle, bloodless.  And theres no follow-up, no future visits from J.B. Fletcher in which the bereaved are staring into space, indifferent to food, conversation, or even a possible Baltimore oriole sighing.

Hes not a bad man, hes a good man who made some bad decisions.  Its an important distinction.

Nothing makes you feel more alive than almost dying.

Overall, Sunburn is an intriguing tale that kept me guessing, but I felt the ending was a bit flat.

7128,149,234,"Rating: 4.0/5.0

A classic dystopian novel. I wanted to read this book again before watching the TV shows.
This was written in 1984 and even when I read it in 2018 it is still as creepy as it used to be before. I still like this novel as I liked it when I read it for the first time many years back.
What I find Margaret Atwood excels in is the detailed description of the world and everything else. She gives you the description of a room and makes you live inside it with her different characters.

I like about this book the small chapters. It makes reading goes very fast, but unfortunately, there is something that bothered me while reading and it is the jump into different time frames. Basically, the author made us jump back and forth between three different time frames. One which is before the change and the second is just about when the world order has changed and the third is the current time where the handmaid is living with the commander and his wife. I feel the jumps were happening fast. Whenever I felt my mind was settling into the situation the jump happened and I am moved into a totally different time and different setting. I wish the time frames were a bit longer or each had its dedicated chapter instead of jumping forward and backward in one single paragraph.

Overall, I would rate this book higher because of its literary aspect more than its entertainment value. This was not boring at all but it leans more towards literary than pure entertainment.
This was a nice reread and good to see that a book still maintains its value after so many years. Recommended.",1519084800,4

7131,583,1778,"Jill Shalvis is my number one all time favorite author. I love the humor she mixes in with the romance. This book surprised me a little, because she also threw in a little mystery to boot! It was also different in that the main female character, Kylie, did a rather masculine job. She is a wood worker.
Kylie and Joe, the hero in the book, are working pretty hard at avoiding love. They shared a kiss--a totally by mistake, accident, etc. kiss. They keep trying to forget it, but it's not cooperating. When Kylie has to go to Joe for help in recovering something that was stolen from her, the heat just keeps climbing. And then there's that little matter of the coin Kyle tossed in the fountain (by proxy) that delivers true love. Their goose is pretty much cooked.
About That Kiss is sexy, funny, suspenseful and just downright delightful!",1519084800,5

7138,282,1874,"Deborah Schaumberg's The Tombs first landed on my radar because of its stunning cover. Then I read the synopsis and a decision was made: I needed it and pronto! As it turns out, The Tombs is a magical and rich debut. It's hard not to become completely enthralled by Avery's journey as well as rooting for her every step of the way.

There's many things Deborah does well here; however, one of the best is the descriptions. It was so incredibly easy to be transported to New York City, 1882. I could picture Avery's world perfectly - the factory, her apartment, the tombs, etc. The tombs actually offered one of my favorite settings: a greenhouse where Avery discovers more answers to her problems! The greenhouse was so cool. I wish it was real so I could go and visit it.

Additionally, Deborah did a fantastic job of fleshing out the story lines. I'll admit this isn't the most fast paced book ever. Deborah takes her time building up the world as well as Avery's past and current struggles; however, I was never once bothered by the speed. I eagerly ate up the descriptions, and I loved getting to know Avery better. More importantly, when things did speed up, I felt prepared. I knew what was going on - and had some very big questions!-and I couldn't wait to see Avery kick butt!

Avery, the main character here, was likable and easy to root for. When the book first begins, Avery has grown use to blending into the background. It's easier for both her father and her that way; however, while Avery may be quiet, she's no pushover by any means. She's strong and powerful, more so than she even thinks. The scenes were she helped her fellow factory workers pulled at my heartstrings. Avery would risk anything for their safety, and that made her even more lovable in my opinion. Additionally, over the course of the book Avery's experiences a coming-of-age. She wants to get to the bottom of her mother's illness, Avery wants to know if she's like her. This brings about many struggles: between Avery and her father, between Avery and her best friend/trusted companion, and even between Avery and herself. It was interesting to see her face this struggle - should she leave it all alone or challenge everything - and I was very happy with the end result.

Now for the one thing that dropped The Tombs down a star: the romance. There's two potential love interests - Avery's best friend & the boy Avery shared a kiss with years ago. Normally, love triangles don't bother me, but I just didn't like it here. I thought Avery's best friend was the better choice; however, she constantly felt drawn to this boy she knew almost nothing about (cue insta-love). It just didn't work for me - I wanted more for Avery, I wanted more for her best friend.

Regardless, The Tombs is a wonderful debut, perfect for YA readers who love their historical fiction with a touch of fantasy and magic. I can't wait to see where Deborah goes next. I'm personally hoping for a sequel!",1519084800,4

7147,883,471,"This story feels old. Its got a spiritual sense which is rarely found in more modern stories when spirituality is neigh unto taboo. The writing demands no belief from the reader, nor does it apologize for anything it presents as true within this story world. Combined with the cadence of the words, it causes the work to resonate on a deep level. I listened to it as an audiobook, so the sound of the words became more important than it might have, had I read it. Part of the resonance of the sound was due to repetition, which did at times become a bit too much.

The plot was fairly direct, predictable but not annoyingly so, and overall very linear. Though Santiago may not always see how each event advanced his quest, the audience could plumb the benefits. In that sense, the arc is rewardingly simple. It feels like the origin of an archetype: the adventurer. However, in the beginning of the story there is a girl, the merchants daughter, who Santiago very much looks forward to meeting again. Much of the beginning of the story is dedicated to description of her and his yearning to once more be in her company, and find out if she too has been wishing for him. However, once he commits to his search for treasure she is never mentioned again. Though he is mere towns away from seeing her again, he instead crosses the sea and desertand even comes all the way back without seeing her. His desire for her is a narrative promise which is never fulfilled, which is not to say that he had to end up with her, only that what was once introduced must somehow be resolved. When he fell in love with another I felt cheated. What had been the point of making such a big deal of the merchants daughter? I could reason that, as he did not fall in love with her immediately he was not meant to, or she could symbolize the life he might have led had he not pursued his personal legend, but there were no story hints. It is an entirely dropped thread, which was annoying.

This story had a beautiful spiritual resonance, and enjoyably straighforward, traditional arc. However, not all narrative promises were fulfilled. I rate this book 8/10.",1519084800,4

7152,432,988,"Avon Books and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of Beneath the Skin.  I was under no obligation to review this book and my opinion is freely given.

Secrets have a way of ruining lives, whether it be friendships or marriages.  Lifelong friends Antonia and Sophie have been hiding crucial parts of themselves from each other and their husbands.  Olivia, the wife of Antonia's husband's friend, outwardly seems put together, but has a secret within that could destroy her marriage.  When a tragedy strikes one of them, will the fallout destroy them all?

Beneath the Skin never came together in any meaningful way, in regards to the plot or the characters.  The constant shifts in perspective tugs the reader from one character to the next, not giving a chance to form a connection with any of them.  There were too many side plots as well, as none of the characters seemed to be immune to having issues.  In the end, Beneath the Skin is one book that has not made a permanent impression on me and, therefore, I would not recommend it to other readers.",1519084800,2

7154,883,129,"This book is one long drug binge. The main character stocks up on everything he can think of and goes to Vegas to cover a story. His lawyer, along for the ride, continually advises him to do things 'as his lawyer,' many of which involve taking drugs. The characters are entertaining. Their stunts are at once horrible and humorous, and much of the fun is derived from the cavalier tone of the writing.

Plot is almost nonexistent in this book. Midway through, between parts one and two, there is a sense that the real story has begun to develop, but this expectation never materializes. The main character, and the lawyer, have undergone no changes through the course of the story, nor, one can assume, will they change anytime soon. They have no desire to. The continual slew of funny to read but insignificant incidents left me bored by the end. The funny tone failed to grow into anything larger, and through repetition lost it's edge. I wanted something besides light entertainment and the understanding of a mindset to stem from the read, but that was all.

This is an apt portrayal of a set of experiences and thoughts, written humorously throughout, that fails to leave any significance. I rate this book 6/10.",1519084800,3
7155,150,108,"F. Scott Fitzgeralds (1896-1940) classic, his best-known novel, was the third of his four finished full-length novels. He died of a heart attack at age 44 before ending The Love of the Last Tycoon. His first, This Side of Paradise, was published in 1920. He also wrote many short stories, essays, published letters, and a comedy, The Vegetable. He is considered one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century, with this book of the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby, one of the great classics of the period.
The book is easy to read, and people who are fearful of reading classics, who think the classics are composed in difficult over-the-top English with obscure references to ancient generally unknown fables, will not find this here; they will discover instead a conversational tone, pathos, and subtle humor. They will find the revelations of the true history of Jay Gatsby, his infatuation with Daisy, his pursuit of her and three-year work to impress her, the comparison between Daisys husband Tom Buchanan and Gatsby, and between Daisy and her husbands mistress, and much more, fascinating.
I admit to being surprised. I had heard, I do not remember where, that the book was about a man living a life of dissipation during a period of dissipation and over-indulgence, looking for fun, drinking into a stupor, among the rich in Long Island, New York. But this is not so. This is a love story. Gatsby is described as eleganta year or two over thirty, very polite, very respectful. He did not drink at his many parties. He was in love, and what he did was driven by this love, to impress his love, and acquire her.
Fitzgerald uses as a narrator of the story of ultra-rich Gatsby a neighbor who was far less rich than Gatsby. The narrator identifies himself as a very honest man, but slow thinking. Because of his lessor intelligence and his high regard for Gatsby, I think that his reports should not be digested without care, without a healthy grain of salt. He tells readers that Gatsby is very lavish, allowing many people to come to his estate for sumptuous parties and stay late, leaving drunk, creating bizarre accidents. He tells about the many legends about the man by people who do not know or respect him. And, more significantly, he reveals Gatsbys love for his cousin Daisy, a married woman. Her husband, a rich man, is having an affair with a married woman, the wife of a foolish gas station owner who is unable to see through her subterfuges, I am visiting my sister, a woman who is somewhat fat, uncouth, and as much as ten years older than him. He is not careful in hiding his affair, and many people know about it.
Despite being a delightfully written novel, I disliked the way that Fitzgerald portrayed blacks and Jews, but Fitzgerald published this classic in 1925, and he was a man of his time.",1519084800,5

7157,681,650,"Okay, I bought this when this first came out, because I LOVED the first book. I loved the fact that Lisa was bringing a new family, and each of the character brings dynamic to the story. At the end of Cold-Hearted Rake Kathleen does something that pretty much pissed off Rhys Winterbourne, and the wedding is called off. At the time Helen was extremely confused, and not sure how she should feel. By the start of Marrying Winterbourne we see Helen do something ballsy, and she changes the course of her life. However, in Marrying Winterbourne we find out some deep dark secrets about the Ravenel which involve Helen. Actually, the secrets that lie in this story explain why Helen is the way she is.

Rhys is definitely ambitious, and he's willing to take down anyone who gets in the way. In some aspects he scares Helen. She truly fears that his ambition will be the reason they won't get married, and there's more to her fear. Helen is an extremely sweet, shy girl, and she's falling everyday in love with Rhys. However, she has a fear that once he learns the truth about her past, he's not going to want anything to do with her. It's a huge burden for her to carry, and she carries it through most of the book. I love how Rhys softens a little for Helen, because she needs that. After all she never really received that as a child. There parents were special.

Overall, Marrying Winterbourne is still a pretty good read. I love that see the whole family throughout the story, but at the same time they are in the background.

7163,915,1028,"After reading all of Tony Hillerman's novels, I was eager to read book 19 in the Leaphorn and Chee series.  I loved Tony's books and his writing style and wondered if Anne's work would be as good as her father's.  Happily, her work is just as good as Tony's - different but excellent.  It is wonderful to read about some of my favorite fictional characters from the point of view of a woman, Chee's wife, Bernie.

I was so absorbed in this book that I couldn't put it down and it's been a long time since I read a book in one day.  As another reader said, I am going back now to read all of Tony Hillerman's books again, just for pure pleasure.  I am currently reading Anne's first novel in her series about Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito, ""Rock With Wings.""  It is every bit as good as ""Spider Woman's daughter.",1519084800,5

7167,883,1881,"This book is a soap opera. This is revealed, quite openly, by the prologue, which shows the main characters (triplets) getting into a loud fight in the middle of a restaurant. They are going through struggles with their personal and love lives, and each other. It comes out that more people have slept together than anybody knew, and an unlikely number of characters are related.

However, I was not much affected by each new development in the growing, twisting drama. The characters felt real, their reactions genuine, but I lacked a connection to them. The scenarios were too over-the-top, and therefor undermined the human connection provided by the characters. There was nothing to the story but drama. I did not have anything to hope for for the characters beyond a lack of drama, which I knew could never be the case. Ultimately, the story was predictable. In any situation, whatever was the most dramatic was what happened. Nothing was unexpected: each new twist already stale.

The characters were real and unique, and though the situations were improbable, each characters reaction within a situation was entirely believable. Further than that, each characters reaction within a situation was exactly what I expected it to be when the scene was introduced. This utter predictability lent the story an atmosphere of stagnation.

This book promised to be an over-the-top drama, and delivered. I rate it 3/10.",1519084800,2

7170,644,1872,"Wow! What an addictive page-turner Sunburn turned out to be. I was sucked into the story from the first page, it was so engrossing, I finished the book in one day. The characters are complex and morally gray (I loved them!) and the pacing is great. The reader doesn't have to wait until the last page for the whole mystery to be revealed. We are getting more and more clues as the story progresses. With each new clue revealed and a new layer peeled away, the story becomes more interesting and more intense. Both Polly and Adam have many secrets and both are not honest with each other, it's not always clear who is the predator and who is the prey in the game they are playing. I really didn't know which way the story would go. Was Polly a victim or was she a villain? What were Adam's intensions? You'll have to read the book to find out!

This book surprised me in the best possible way. I've read a lot of thrillers lately and was feeling a little burnt out (excuse the pun) but Sunburn reignited my appreciation for the genre.

We last left Malcolm being pushed into a fish pond after he is caught having sex with another woman while his wife is massively pregnant. I didn't think we could ever forgive Malcolm, but MacLean does an excellent job of tracing the journey of Sera and Malcolm from first lust, to betrayal, to redemption.

I adore MacLean's portrayal of the Sera and her sisters and their undying loyalty to each other and their give a damn attitude about society. It was also refreshing to see a romance that deals with real infidelity and the struggle to forgive. While I don't generally like stories based around lies and hidden agendas this one takes that trope and demonstrates why the truth is always best. Both Malcolm and Sera made massive mistakes which helps balance it all out and makes the payoff all the more satisfying at the end.

7190,601,722,"Bali Kaur Jaswal s Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows is mostly what it says it is. Which is to say this is not for the youngsters. The Erotic stories, and there are a few, are titillating but not particularly explicit. If you do not like reading about mostly conventional fantasies, the title of the book should be sufficient warning.

Ms. Jaswal has attempted a number of story lines. In no particular order:
A young woman seeking to balance between her culture, her traditional family and her modern ideas.
Eastern, specifically Punjabi culture meets Western, specifically British.
The suppression of women, specifically older, women in the Punjabi culture.
These same women finding an outlet or at least an expression for their sexuality
One or more mysterious deaths.

And these are only the major story lines. Something of a crowded field for a 298 page novel.

Initially I had expected a fairly balances discussion of traditional values versus modern values, but every chapter or so a new story line opened. This creates a lot to think about but not so much in the way of answers.

The erotic stories are scattered about and are the result of the Punjabi Widows hijacking an English Language course that was to be taught by Nikki, a modern Punjabi woman, law school dropout seeking her purpose while maintain her links to her mother and dealing with the recent death of her father, who may have died angry with Nikki and coming to terms with the traditions of her culture and looking for Mr. Right. Like I said a lot of story lines. O I forgot there are at least one suspicious death; actually two.

To her credit, Ms Jaswal does a good job describing Punjabi culture, its overly male orientation and the problems of living in or nearly in this community. I like a book that take the reader into a world previously unknown but from reality. Erotic Stories succeeds at this. Despite the overall shallow handling of the deeper themes in her novel, when the time comes to bring the threads together and bring about the climax (pun not exactly intended) she builds the tension and keeps the reader engaged and eager for the finish.

The denouement arrives in the form of several chapters, each designed to tie up all loose ends. With this many story lines, there are going to be loose ends. In this, a better editor would have guided the author to a shorter simpler wind up.",1519171200,3

7192,534,46,"This novel concentrates  on some favorite themes of Vonnegut; those of inequality, luck, happenstance and indifference to others. The novel is very similar in terms of them and characterization to ""Slaughterhouse 5"" and in terms of  the themes of inequality and indifference to ""Player Piano"".

Vonnegut was born in 1922 and so was a member of the generation that grew up in the Great Depression and entered adulthood during World War 2. I don't find it surprising then that this novel points out the degree with which luck and happenstance are behind much of the apparent success of individuals in society. people. He saw action in WW2. He saw masses of people being killed by simply being in the wrong place. He saw the indifference to life that marks war. What then is the purpose of life? Why are we alive. How do we confront the meaningless that is behind existence? In the novel, human civilization is directed by Tanfalmadorians to function as a means of sending messages to the pilot of a disabled space ship on the Saturn moon Triton. Malachi Constant is distressed whn he discovers this on Triton.

Vonnegut proposes an answer the questions in ending of the book. That is the answer of empathy and compassion to each other. Life is inherently meaningless at its base but that does not mean that it cannot be given meaning. Salo supplies Malachi Constant with a hypnotic post suggestion that gives him comfort in the final seconds of his life. Salo is a machine that the organic inhabitants of Trnfalmadore developed to find the meaning with life. When the machines found that there was no meaning, the organic Tranfalmaorians committed mass suicide by machine. Salo, the machine, found a purpose with his development of empathy and compassion by his interaction with constant on Triton",1519171200,4

7196,672,1860,"Summary from Goodreads:

""Just outside of Cambridge, Lilling seems like an unassuming idyllic English village, but its home to a dark history. In 1976, a teenage girl named Annalise Wood disappeared while riding her bike home from school. Though her body was later discovered in a shallow grave, the culprit was never found. Decades later, Annalise maintains a perverse kind of celebrity in the small town, and is still the focus of grief, speculation, and for one young woman, a disturbing, escalating jealousy.

When DNA linked to the Annalise murder unexpectedly surfaces, cold case investigator Morris Keene realizes he may now have the chance of his career. Morris and his former partner, Chloe Frohmann, hope to finally solve this perplexing mystery, and bring closure to a traumatized community. But the new evidence that should be the simple solution instead undoes the case's only certainty: the buried body that had long ago been confidently identified as Annalise may be someone else entirely, and instead of answers, the investigators face only new puzzles.

Whose body was unearthed all those years ago, and what happened to the real Annalise? Could she have had a secret child? Is someone interfering with the investigation? And is there a link to a present-day drowning with eerie connections?

With piercing insight and fascinating twists, Emily Winslow explores the dark side of sensationalized crime in this haunting psychological thriller.""

My Thoughts:

I read the above summary and just knew that I wanted to read this book as soon as possible so I jumped at the chance when I received an email about a blog tour for it.  I didn't realize that it was part of a series though and honestly it didn't effect my enjoyment in the slightest.  I found myself just so intrigued by this cold case that was being worked again thanks to new evidence.  I did find that that I was slightly thrown off at the beginning of this book because each chapter was told by a certain character.  It took me a little bit to catch on to the rhythm (and also get to know each character) but by the halfway point I was hooked.  I then really appreciated the different viewpoints as I felt that it added to the overall story line.  I also felt like the way that this book was set up added to the suspense.  The author pulled me in and I didn't want to stop reading after that.  I would think that I had an idea of what was going on only to find that I was completely wrong not long after.  There were some particularly tense moments featuring the story line told by the psychologist that had me unable to set this book down.  I just had to see what was going to happen next!  There were all of these threads in this book and I loved that the author was able to tie them together in a way at the end that felt like a satisfying but unexpected conclusion.  I am now really excited to go back to the beginning of this series and see how it all started!

Overall I am very excited about this series and really enjoyed my time with this book.  The way that this book is set up and the fact that it was based around a cold case made it really stand out to me.  It's different from what is out there and I really appreciated that fact.  I also really enjoyed the main characters and am excited that I have more books with them to look forward to.  I wanted to say that this was a quieter mystery but there were just enough of those fast paced moments where that wouldn't be a valid statement.  It was a great mystery though and I'm eager to read more by this author.  I would recommend this book to fans of both suspense and mysteries alike.  It's definitely a four star read for me!

Bottom Line:  A really great mystery that kept me engrossed throughout!

Ashbury, horribly scarred from a rocket explosion during the campaign against Napoleon figures he has found a convenient bride. Emma is of child-bearing age, she's pretty, she isn't scared of him, and she has nothing to lose by suddenly becoming rich.

They strike a deal - Emma will become his wife, they'll eat dinner together, have sex in the dark, and when she bears his heir she'll be set up for life away from him. What they both don't expect is that they are perfect for one another, despite both their flaws.

So much fun, so swoony, and a lovely way to spend the evening. I loved all the banter between Emma and Ashbury, her silly nicknames for him and the slow, steamy way they eventually fall in love.

7202,1071,26,"This is embarrassing. I started reading this and immediately knew the first story, which is a good clue I've read it before. I continued knowing the stories all the way through. In fact I'm pretty sure this book is where I first learned of Blue Apron(tm). I don't keep a good list usually (though I'm trying to remedy that) and apparently I'd not marked it as read. Every time my Kindle updates, it marks ALL of my books as ""New"" so I have no idea.

Nonetheless, this book was worth a second read. I have a feeling I may have blocked some of this one out because it's so truthful and honest, and I wasn't in a place - even just a couple of years ago - to be quite so honest with myself. Something has changed since then, and I truly appreciated her sharp honesty on this read. I found many things I could relate to: most of all the desire to disappear after trauma, and to disappear by gaining enough weight that society ignores you. This book alone could give grist for the therapy mill for a while (honestly, these topics have been grist for the therapy mill for a while already...)

It's funny. I work in this arena. I know all of these things. I can therapize others with the best of them, but it's so tough to be this kind of honest with myself or the few people I trust most.  I certainly couldn't write a book about my personal shame. I so appreciate, respect and owe massive gratitude to Roxane Gay and others who write this kind of truth.",1519171200,5
7203,681,570,"Can I tell you how much I love Pandora's story? Seriously, I LOVE HER! She's not an ordinary young woman. Her mind is going 90 mph, and going all sorts directions. When she accidentally entraps Gabriel, her first thought is I'm not marrying him. He's puzzled by that, her feelings toward marriage. After all, he's trying to do the right thing, and he's stuck with a girl who doesn't want anything to do with him. Puzzled and intrigued. Gabriel puts on this facade that he's pretty perfect, except for his mistress. Overall, he's on the up and up. Now he's kind of stuck with this high-spirited girl.

I love Devil In Spring, because we see that through most of the story Pandora trying to show how unsuitable she would be to Gabriel. Gabriel has no clue, but he wants this enchanting creature. His family adores her natural charm, and he kind of enlist their help to figure out a way to show Pandora it will be all right. Gabriel is a lot of fun, because he's such a stand up guy. At first he wants to marry her because it's the right thing to do, but he starts to fall for her hard and fast.

I kind feel like Pandora as I'm righting this, because there's so much I want to tell you about this story. At the same time I can't, because I don't want to spoil. Yes, Pandora does stumble onto something sinister, and I think this plot line carries into the next story. However, the main part of the story is about these two people who accidentally find themselves in a compromising situation. They both need to compromise what they are willing to give and take for happiness.

7204,1130,730,"A remarkable book. I am a Little House purist (hated the TV series) and I sincerely expected to hate this book, but I loved every minute of it. The author did a beautiful job of mirroring the language of the Little House books, but in Caroline Ingalls' voice. It is not a fast-paced read, but to me it was immensely rewarding to get to know Caroline, not just as 'Ma' but as herself. It's difficult to write good historical fiction. Either, the characters have too modern a viewpoint, or, if they are too historically authentic, they can seem unlikable to modern eyes. I think that's the problem some other reviewers are having -- they are reading Caroline's reserve (definitely on feature in all of the Little House books) as coldness or joylessness. I didn't find it that way myself. I felt I really got behind her eyes to the 'real' woman. There is a lovely tribute to Caroline in The Long Winter. In the Christmas barrel the family receives from back east, there is a silk shawl: ""Who gets this shawl?"" Pa asked, and they all said, ""Ma!"" Such a beautiful shawl was for Ma, of course. Pa laid it on her arm, and it was like her, so soft and yet firm and well-wearing, with the fine, bright colors in it.""

7206,302,1872,"Sunburn by Laura Lippman is an excellent, very highly recommended novel of psychological suspense. Written in the traditional noir style of writer James M. Cain, this novel is full of dark secrets, passion, and betrayal.

Set in 1995, Polly and Adam meet at the High-Ho tavern in Belleville, Delaware. Both claim to just be passing through when they first meet, but both find jobs at the tavern and stay. Neither Polly nor Adam is who they say they are; both have secrets and a private agenda. They are attracted to each other, but keep their distance, staying guarded and alert, but focused on the other. Fate determines they will become lovers.

Polly was on beach vacation in Fenwick, Delaware, with her husband, Gregg, and three-year-old daughter, Jani, when she walked out and left them both behind. What kind of woman leaves her husband and daughter behind? Adam knows a bit more about Polly than Gregg does. Adam has been told about her past, hired to find her, and figure out what she is doing. Both have secrets and are playing a game, but one of them is playing a long con and murder may be an option.

Superb, excellent, outstanding! Lippman's skillful writing shines in this sophisticated, twisty, satisfying noir, full of secrets, past and present, and mysteries. Sunburn is perfectly plotted and will gripe you from the beginning to the end. Readers will not know who or if they can trust any of these characters. There is betrayal, revenge, lust, and murder, but where does the truth rest?  The mystery will grip you while you try to figure out what these people are planning.

And the characters! Lippman shines in her ability to portray these characters. They are all so well-developed - nuanced, complicated, mysterious, finely layered, conflicted. Certainly Polly is an unreliable narrator and unlikable, or is she? Adam has his secrets, but does he know the truth? Can we trust what they are revealing, or do we need to seek what they aren't saying? Even the supporting cast of characters is wonderfully realized.

I enjoyed Sunburn from start to finish.

7207,159,1836,"When I read the synopsis of The Atomic City Girls I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I could get my hands on it! I've read lots of stories that take place before, during, or directly after WWII, from a variety of angles and perspectives, but surprisingly enough I had not read anything that dealt with Oak Ridge, Tennessee or the secretive work done there. It was a whole new world for me to explore and I went into the reading with very high expectations. I'm happy to say that many, if not all, of  my expectations were met and by the last page I felt like I had a brand new understanding and appreciation for the work done at home in support of the horrific fighting happening abroad.

 Right from the start I was awed by the well-rounded approach author Janet Beard presented for the reader. Oak Ridge was quite the conglomeration of very different people, from the top scientific minds and trained soldiers to hardworking yet undereducated local women and African American field hands and everything in between. While still separated for the most part by race and class they all nonetheless lived for years within this highly secured fishbowl of hard work and fast play that served to not only shoot the Allies into the lead of atomic warfare but served to foster quite a lot of drama for its inhabitants. They all came to Oak Ridge for a variety of reasons - to escape guilt, to find a wealthy husband, to prove oneself a worthy man even if not fighting across seas, to try and secure a better future for ones family, and much more - and none left without being highly effected by what they experienced there.

 My favorite aspect of the novel was the attention given to the actual day to day goings on of the people who lived there. They worked long, odd shifts (work that was done without really knowing why it was being done...all the secrets!) and had a vast variety of goods and entertainment at hand at all hours - a movie theatre, cafeteria, pharmacy and grocery, bowling alley, dance hall, and more. They lived in a variety of housing as well, depending on their rank, marital status, and race, whether that be trailers, dormitories, or traditional houses. The women dressed in their best, brightest dresses whenever possible and men sought to impress in pristine dress or uniforms (most at least). There was even a more dangerous side for those that sought it out, filled with things like gambling and illegal alcohol. It all comes to life in an exciting way and really drives home the unique and exhilarating time and place this would have been.

 My only real issue (if it can be called that) with the story was some of the highly unsympathetic characters who I sometimes found a distraction from the more interesting central theme of what was actually happening at Oak Ridge. While I enjoyed both June and Joe as well as the perspectives they brought to the table, I found both Sam and Cici just awful people. Cici is particularly horrid, using anyone and anything in her power to get what she wants and to ensure she is able to put everyone else in their places, way below her. Sam is a practiced complainer and alcoholic who doesn't treat June the way she deserves and seems to be unhappy no matter what he is experiencing. While these two characters serve their purposes in moving along certain aspects of the narrative (in particular Sam), I would have preferred they not be such dislikable characters. These aspects of their personalities didn't add anything to the story for me and served to only irritate me when they showed up on the page. I also have to wonder at the title of the story as it's about so much more than the women who worked at Oak Ridge. Joe and (unfortunately) Sam are as much a part of the overall story as June and Cici, making the title seem like an odd choice to me.

 Overall, The Atomic City Girls was a fascinating look at this singular place and time in history. I very much enjoyed learning about what was being done at Oak Ridge and the interesting environment it was for those that worked there. I should also mention that each chapter ends with actual historical photographs from Oak Ridge, which I LOVED. Anyone who enjoys historical fiction, particularly that which takes placed during WWII, will enjoy the peek into this insular world not as well known (at least not to me) as other aspects of the war.",1519171200,4
7208,1071,499,"It took a while to get into this one. As I was about to give up, I cheated and skipped to the final chapter, read three sentences, squished my face into an ""aww man"" and decided I had to know how they got from where I was (chapter 13-ish?) to there. So I turned back with some real chagrin and read on. The more I read, the more I liked the story and the more I liked the story, the more I liked almost everyone involved in this family -- Chabon's family? Good question. I note that it won awards for fiction, but it seems like nonfiction-y fiction or fictionalized nonfiction, or some blend of the two. It's essays, a novel, biography, historic, dramatic, funny and a bunch of other stuff: like a family, I guess. Is it sad? Well, only in the way that everyone's life has some sadness and grief involved. It's not sad overall though, not by a long shot.

Moonglow is a wild ride that starts at the bedside of one man dying which turns into a lifetime, a family's story, a very American story - complete with redemptive arcs, great scenes of cities I love, and real vitality. It feels so real because of the little details and the nuances that I haven't found in Chabon's other work. It's very different from the other work in some ways, yet there's always those metaphors. Apparently he inherited that ability, says the [fictionalized nonfiction-ish] grandfather.

It's clear that Chabon has a very close understanding of the convoluted underpinnings, including street names, neighborhoods, buildings, businesses, and a real love of the family about which he writes. I wish I'd felt the love before I did. It took me a long time to care about these people. I felt rather divorced from the story being told for far too long. It goes on wild tangents -- sometimes they work beautifully (the story of the snake hunting is a prime example of a beautiful tangent that tells a lovely tangent of a story that tells us important things about the main character) and sometimes they just fell flat for me. It was during one of those moments that I almost abandoned the book.

I'm not a skimmer, thank goodness. If one skims in this story, one will miss something that turns out to be vital many pages later. Not in the sense of ""how?"" but more in the sense of why it matters. I'd imagine it's hard to write a story where all at once you're in the present and past, explaining why someone is finally telling you things you've been angry at them for not telling your whole life. Perhaps this fictionalized way was the only way to get some of this family's secrets out?

It's very hard to believe this is plain ole fiction - no matter how good. (Unless maybe that explains all the awards.) I doubt it's for everyone. I thought it wasn't for me, but I found myself wishing I'd known the family of the narrator (who is never called Michael Chabon, but who has a very similar life to its author, Michael Chabon.) I'm glad I read it, and I was sorry when it ended. I've moved on, but the characters and their warm spirits - especially an awkward, flawed, yet fiercely loving grandfather -- will stay with me for a long time.",1519171200,4
7209,1071,906,"I wasn't planning on reading this today. It fell from my new pile, and as I went to get coffee, I started to read and finished it in one sitting.

Original and devastating. A child ""outside the fence"" long before anyone knew what went on at a place he understands to be called ""Out-With"" where he's moved because his father has been promoted to commandant. The family is housed on the grounds and on day one Bruno sees what he imagines to be not very fun children across the field. He and his sister didn't want to move from Berlin, but what choice does a child have? So off they go to and nobody tells them much beyond they have to go. Since nobody tells them anything, they have to make it up for themselves and figure it out on their own. But how do you figure out the unimaginable?

They've always lived in the city, so the kids first decide that a lot of strange-seeming things just are because this is ""the countryside;"" he calls his father's boss ""the Fury."" Bruno is the son of an important man in a Nazi party, but he knows nothing about it. Why should he? Nobody knew anything about what was going on in those camps for a very long time. (Recall the reactions of the grown-up soldiers who liberated the camps or the newspaper accounts in the days afterward.)

It's apolitical and not historical. It's mostly a fable and readers will need to be very young and naive or willing to suspend belief for a few hours while they step into the shoes of a young German boy who does not have the benefit of history or being outside anything but his own, very small, world. (Bruno is nine, but it feels more like around six or so. He's certainly much younger than today's nine year old kids.)

Perhaps the best part of this book comes at the very end, after the whole story is over. The narrator says, ""Of course all this happened a long time ago, and nothing like that could ever happen again. Not in this day and age.""

Talk about a gut punch.

And also an opening to what is going on in many parts of the world right now, has gone on in recent years, etc.

I'm now listening to an interview with the author and publisher. They discuss how many survivors, their children and grandchildren have read this book and decided that they should have their children read it. Marketed first as an adult book, it's a fable and would be OK for people of any age with some guard rails. If a child reads it, they will need a grown-up guide to fill in all of the things Bruno doesn't grasp. It's an opening conversation to both history and the way complacency, secrecy, prejudice, denial, and deceit have devastating consequences.",1519171200,5

7216,2,403,"On the whole I love the Farseer trilogy (and the wider series that it begins), but every time I read this particular book, I find myself losing patience about halfway through. It's one of those fantasy novels that consist mostly of characters walking across their realm, and the already meager plot often gets further bogged down in mysticism about ancient secrets. There are enough interesting character moments to make me stick with the story even on a reread, but it's well below the level of the Elderlings saga at its best.",1519257600,3

As long as Huck and Jim are traveling down the river, the story is brilliant.  I wish that Twain had stuck with that.  I don't care what the literary geniuses say, thats my opinion and Im sticking to it.  Not that anybody cares.

Other than that, I don't in general review classics--so much has already been written about them.  I appreciate Twain's anti-slavery, anti-racism portrayal and the character of Huck, but it gets so muddied with the faux-romanticism of Tom that, as I say, it goes off the rails.",1519257600,3

7220,4,819,"Fans of suspense thrillers will find much to enjoy in a debut novel titled, The Woman in the Window, by A.J. Finn, a pseudonym of Daniel Mallory, who had worked as an editor at Morrow. Finn delivers great complex characters, the gradual unveiling of an entertaining plot, and a narrative that offers homage to great noir films. I found my reading pace remained steady, like the regular frames of a film as sentences went by a constant clip. If you've been entertained by a Hitchcock film and enjoy noir, chances are you'll like this novel and the fine writing it offers.

7221,4,1316,"In her novel titled, This Could Hurt, Jillian Medoff puts the ""human"" in Human Resources. Workplace novels can often lean toward shallow and boring stereotypes. While Medoff veers in that direction sometimes in this novel, for the most part she creates interesting and complex characters who behave in ways, both good and bad, that will resonate for most readers. Set mostly during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the novel offers a plot that fits that time very well. Each character has to respond to change, like it or not.

When the last carving from her grandfather is stolen from her, she's determined to get it back, but how? Desperate, she asks for help from a guy who might be able to help her, but who rubs her the wrong way (or does she just not want to admit he'd like to rub her some other way?).

Joe, too, is wary, because Kylie demands that he feel something. Feelings are bad and he's been avoiding them ever since he turn guilty at what happened to his little sister when she was kidnapped.

Those pesky feelings, the good kind that beat back the bad ones, push these two characters closer and closer to revealing what they really want even as the clues about where that penguin went and who took it and why gradually are revealed. What is finally discovered makes for a satisfying read.",1519257600,4
7223,373,1378,"I have an affinity for fine art, Paris during World War II, and a good mystery. So, when they are walloped together into an ingeniously woven and well-written novel I am hooked beyond pleasure.
Ive waited to read ""The Paris Secret"" by Karen Swan ever since it hit the best-seller lists back in early November. However, a copy of it  appreciatively received from the publisher  sat on my TR&R stack well beyond my Twelve Days celebration of Christmas. But, finally, after the all the festivities died down, I started reading it. It was well worth the wait. So much so, that I savored it for a whole month!
Flora Skyes, the intrepid, cool-headed protagonist is a dynamically high-powered art agent. She is hired by a supposedly noble family to trace the provenance of a cache of paintings hidden since 1943 in an abandoned Paris apartment. As she begins her quest to document the previous owners of the pieces, she finds herself instantly embroiled in mystery and intrigue, uncovering underlying and overlaying schemes of deceit and deception that permeate the Vermeil family who claim ownership of the apartment.
One painting in particular  a portrait of a women in a yellow dress  captures her attention. As she focusses in on its history and why and how it came to be secreted by itself in yet another abandoned apartment below the first, Flora learns of a German art dealer supposedly working for the Third Reich who sold the paintings stolen from Jews whom he was suspected of betraying to the Nazis. What connection did he have with the Vermeils? And how did the paintings  these supposedly in his possession at the time of his disappearance  wind up in their abandoned apartment?
With its flowing, adjective-riddled complex sentences and sometimes often oblique references to historical events, The Paris Secret is quite different form the typical run-of-the-mill murder and/or robbery mystery. It appeals to the more intellectually astute reader who seeks total immersion in the lives, times, and not so familiar day-to-day affairs and experiences of complex, in-depth characters. It also appeals to the higher-end fashionistas of both the art and haute-couture worlds. It must be said that Swan, the British author, started her writing career as an editor in the fashion industry. So, of course, it stands to reason that this, her second entry into the literary world, would be pock-marked with all sorts of descriptions of her characters attire, many of which were well beyond my ken. However, the descriptions and references only added to the allure of this mystery. Living with Flora and her fashion-minded friends while delving into the darker enigmatics of the art world was an entirely different, thoroughly enjoyable experience for me.
Careening through the last 100 pages, Swann adeptly and adroitly begins to tie up all her loose ends. Flora finds not only resolution to the many baffling aspects of her case, but also [finally] finds love with one of the more perplexing characters. He was not whom I wanted her to end with had I written this novel, but, then again, the coupling makes perfect, if not surprising, sense. And whom Von Teschelt, the nefarious so-called Nazi art dealer  as well as the lady in the portrait  turn out to be Well, it was the one of the most satisfying endings to a most satisfying story.

7225,941,1699,"This is a pretty solid sci-fi story.
This book has a nice slow burn story build up which helps to get you into the feel of some of the main characters as it builds an entire new world up around them. The author really took a lot of time to plan this planets creatures out. There are so many new species to explore and those on the planet are still learning about them as well. Matter of fact, everything there is very scientific. The children are raised to be highly trained so they all seem to be quite intelligent for the most part. As the main character, Octavia, begins to notice something strange about herself other strange/suspicious things begin to take place and the story sort of starts to pick up.
I don't want to give the book away because that would be a terrible thing to do!  The tale is told in smooth way that keeps you turning the pages. I did find it to stall out a bit at times or  just kind of drag on when it could have been giving more details, perhaps about the jungle and the native people within.  All in all though, it's a good book and if you like a little YA sci-fi it's one you should give a try.  It most certainly ends on a cliffhanger!",1519257600,3

7227,4,930,"Chances are, if your education is anything like mine, all you really think of when the name Neville Chamberlain comes to mind is ""appeasement,"" something our leaders should avoid. In his novel titled, Munich, Robert Harris covers just a few days in 1938, the days before and after Chamberlain's meeting with Hitler in Munich over Germany's takeover of the Sudetenland, a German speaking area of what was Czechoslovakia. As in earlier novels, Harris describes settings with great detail, offers an interesting and engaging plot, and leads readers to a view of Chamberlain that is kinder now than in recent decades. In the novel, the delay that Chamberlain achieved in Munich was in response to the lack of preparedness in England to engage in war with Germany. As in our lives, when our choices are less than satisfying, we will select the least bad alternative, and Harris presents Chamberlain as doing just that in 1938. He delayed confrontation with Hitler until the country was ready, and that prudent act was in no way appeasement.

7231,725,1001,"Even before her recent passing, I've known that my lack of experience with the works of Ursula K. Le Guin was a shortcoming I needed to rectify. The only book of hers I've read wasThe Dispossessed, a book I admired a lot while ultimately finding a bit dry and didactic. (It's also a book I plan on revisiting soon, ideally after reading some more Le Guin and now that I know what to expect, to see if I feel differently about it.) And, as authors paid tribute to the legendary author in the wake of her passing, one novel that I saw mentioned again and again wasThe Lathe of Heaven, which I knew nothing about.

And, man, am I glad I checked it out. Often viewed as Le Guin's tribute to the works of Philip K. Dick,The Lathe of Heaven undeniably feels a lot like a Dick novel, with a surreal hook used to explore philosophical questions about reality and who we really are. But as you'd expect from Le Guin, there's no shortage of more social questions raised here, from the nature of peace to the dangers of global warming, all done within a great narrative that twists and turns underneath you.

The hook is simple enough: there's a man named George Orr (yes, the half allusion is probably intentional) who is scared to dream, because his dreams become real. But what makes this hard to prove is that his dreams don't just create reality; theyrewriteit, making whatever he dreams not only true, but making italways have beentrue, so that no one remembers the change but him. That's true until George goes to court-mandated therapy, where his therapist seems to be aware of the change - and his ability to possibly control George's ability.

Like she did inThe Dispossessed, Le Guin explores any number of ideas about utopias, the role of the individual in society, the question of the greater good, and her concerns about utilitarianism. At what point should the individual give way for society? Where is the cutoff between acceptable sacrifice for the greater good and too much? And what is the responsibility of one person to give it all for the world? But whereasThe Dispossessedengaged with these ideas in the forms of detailed discussions,The Lathe of Heaven lets them remain more subtextual, unfolding as a battle of wills between George, his therapist, and a lawyer George brings in to help him. More than that,The Lathe of Heaven unfolds as a bizarre thriller of sorts, with reality constantly bending and shifting underneath us, and Le Guin able to explore the ramifications of so many changes, and what it would take to fix some of the problems in our world.

It all adds up to a great book, one that I really enjoyed. And if it's a bit derivative of PKD, well, that's okay, because Le Guin makes it her own, following the political and social ramifications of her conceit, not just the philosophical ones. It's a book I really enjoyed and absolutely couldn't put down, and has me eager to dive into more of an author I don't feel like I ever properly appreciated in her lifetime.",1519344000,5

7234,775,501,"The century was going to change from the 19th to the 20th. The whole of Europe was engaged in a vast race towards Africa and Asia to colonize these continents. Colonization is a crime against humanity and to be made possible, I mean for human beings to be made to accept such a crime they commit against Black Africans, you need to summon the deepest and the darkest frustrations, violent impulses, phantasms of glory, domination, power and  the element Conrad neglects in his good Polish Catholicism  sexual perversion. And all that is contained in the simple concept of Darkness, this satanization and diabolization of the color of the people there, Black Africans. To conquer them you have to see them as brutes, monsters, animals, of course cannibals, and even just plain devils who go around naked because thats the only thing they want: to submit you, to rape you, to eat you and then to throw your bones in the river.

Everything, every detail every moment in the story is the revelation of the darkness of the heart of the colonizing people he calls the pilgrims and their darkness of heart is entirely justified by the fact the people here are dark. They even turn it around and Kurtz at the end, just before dying, uttering his seventh word of some Christ dying on some cross, will utter what this continent is all about The Horror! The Horror! And thus the horror of the heart of the colonizer becomes the horror in the repulsive perverse devils that are inhabiting the black skins of these dark beings. The whole book is about this reversal that leads Marlow to total and final perdition.

All European nationalities are mixed and mixed up in this plundering mission, this vastest and most systematic plundering of one branch of humanity by another. French, English, German, Russian are all in one steamboat that is leaking like hell and that is floating like a cork on a very dark ocean in the middle of a very black moonless night. Their sole objective is to get as much ivory out of this continent in exchange for trinkets and beads, of insignificant small items that are worth nothing. The Europeans are looting the continent for whats a precious material and paying for it with what we would give children for them to play on a Sunday afternoon.

Kurtz is the particular pilgrim who decided to invest himself into this black magic culture of Africa and he is the demonstration that this policy is dangerous for the whites, but never does he ask if this policy is good for black Africa. In fact, he never asks what could be good for black Africa. So the steamboat goes up the river, the Congo river, for example, picks up a load of ivory and gives away some beads and some very cheap fabric, and then it comes back as fast as they can. Most of the sailors on this steamboat are blacks. They are paid in currency but they have to take care of their food. That means they come with some hippo meat that rots in a couple of days, and then they don't seem to have much to eat if they do not catch a fish from time to time. They don't seem to have grocery stores on the banks of this river.

But that is the surface of the story and the end of it, in fact, it is the central argument since this story is what Marlow tells his English audience in a private meeting about his experience in Africa, the end of this story leads to a metaphorical meaning, maybe even an allegorical meaning. This story, this adventure is a way to reveal the mind, the heart, the empathy or lack of it in the Europeans who may decide to take the next ship to go there. The girlfriend of Kurtz is just the perfect representative of these narrow-minded, racist bigots. She wants to be recognized as the girlfriend of Kurtz and as such get some of his reputation, though she did not go to Africa. Too dangerous, baby, too perilous. But Marlow is led to maybe his first lie in this story when he pretends the last word of Kurtz when he was dying was her name. Kurtz did not call for her but he called for us to realize that this colonial mission is against nature and his last words were The Horror! The Horror! But the horror we are speaking of here is the horror in the European minds, hearts, and souls. Europeans are governed and managed by the horror that is deeply embedded in their flesh. They all are voyeurs and want to be shown this horror. They are all predators and they want to take part in this pounding on these black Africans you can just torture, kill, behead and do so many other things to for your pleasure that you call security, and even state or company security. And there is no age limit as for that. Imagine what you could do to a young boy or a young girl with the benediction of your state or your company.

This novella is definitely a revealing dive into the darkest layers or European hearts, minds, and souls, where the darkness finds its heart really, not in Africa.

Finn'sThe Woman in the Window, ten months inside her house has familiarized her with her neighbors' schedules to the extent that deviations pique her interest to startling degrees.

Anna Fox is a child psychiatrist whose sudden onset of agoraphobia after an traumatic accident has left her unable to leave her house in New York City for ten months. Separated from her husband and her daughter, Anna's time alone leaves her drifting from room to room as she convalesces and drinks copious amounts of Merlot. A keen observer of people, Anna takes to watching her neighbors through her windows and her camera to occupy the time she doesn't spend counseling other agoraphobic people online. When the Russell family moves in, Anna's attention is drawn to their picture perfect life but kept strongly focused on them after she hears a scream from their home and witnesses a stabbing, leading her to try to discover the truth of the events.

A compelling story with brief chapters that progress quickly, it's easy to get caught up in Anna's narration and presentation of events, even as you may question her reliability. While the abundant film references became a bit heavy-handed, they helped to blur the line between the reality and fiction of Anna's convictions of what she saw and heard happening in her neighborhood. The easy comparisons to make areRear Window andThe Girl on the Train as the narrative shares similar traits with both of them in scenario and unreliable narrators, which made the story familiar and quite predictable; while not groundbreaking or novel, the story is still entertaining as it draws you in to Anna's recuperating mind.

Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1519344000,4
7242,889,1673,"Ten years is long enough for me to be hung up on a man who hates to want me. Who I cant seem to hate enough to stop wanting.

This was a damn treat to read. One of my favorite second chance romances of all time. Never have I ever read such a sexy book, that constantly emphasizes the importance (and sexiness) of consent! On top of the fact that this book has some amazing diversity from most of the cast of characters, but it also showcases an Asian main character who is living with her depression and who loves her soft body completely and unapologetically. I loved this. Absolutely loved this. And I completely recommend this to every romance reader.

Hate to Want You switches between two perspectives:
 Nicholas - In line to own his familys empire, while working constantly.
 Livvy - Tattoo artist who won't stay in one city for too long.

Love rarely conquered all, the true villains almost always went unpunished, and happily ever afters? Ha. Sometimes all you could hope for were secret stolen moments with one messy, royally bad girl.

And their lives have been intertwined forever, since their family used to co-own a business. Key word: used to. After a tragedy, that business relationship fell apart, so Nicholas and Livvys relationship fell apart, too. Yet, every ten years, on Livvys birthday, she will text Nicholas coordinates to meet her in a different city. And he always comes. And they always have mind-blowing sex.

Except, last birthday, Livvys thirtieth birthday, which would have marked ten years since Nicholas started traveling each and every year to find her, she didn't send a text. But now shes back in town, staying with her mother, in the city where Nicholas and her grew up and fell in love. And Nicholas is not only curious why she didn't text him, but hes also trying to keep his emotions in check.

How can I be with anyone else when I spend three hundred and sixty-four days waiting for you to draw me a map?

And Nicholas and Livvys families are heavily connected. Like, generations back connected. And throughout the story we slowly get to see what drove them apart ten years ago, while also focusing on everything that is still keeping them apart.

You all, it was refreshing to read about people actually older than me for once in a romance novel! Seriously, Ive been feeling in kind of a funk about my age and reading lately, and this was a breath of fresh air! The media we consume just makes us feel like we should be married, in our dream homes, with kids, in our late twenties. Then this beautiful and actually realistic story comes along, and it was the perfect thing that me and my head space needed.

The world was unkind to women. It was devastating to women who didn't believe in themselves.

This was the most seamlessly woven feminist romance novel Ive ever read, too. And I honestly feel like Im going to rate all romance reads off of this one book. I always add little caveats for my erotic reads, about how I rate them differently, because so many of the themes are so unhealthy, toxic, and problematic, but now I understand thats just bad and lazy writing. Alisha Rai wrote this beautiful, powerful, sexy as hell, feministic book that didn't have any of those unhealthy elements that Ive come to expect. I was proud to finish this book, and this author has now set the bar for me, and Im not looking back.

I read this article once that said the quickest way to get a dude to stop hitting on you was to say that you're with another guy, because men respect other men more than they respect a woman saying no.

This was honestly pure joy to read. It was so fast paced, so intriguing, so sexy, so powerful. The representation was beyond words amazing. The themes were important and so very appreciated. And the story was great. I cant wait to read every single thing Alisha Rai has created. Dont sleep on this one, lovelies.",1519344000,5
7243,455,1872,"Suspense writer Laura Lippman is best known for her crime novels set in the city of Baltimore. The city is as much of a character in her novels as the people she writes about. Her newest novel, Sunburn, leaves Baltimore for  the small beach town of Belleville, Delaware, a tourist town that booms during the summer months, and reverts to its small town ways the rest of the year. A town Polly describes as ""put together from other town's leftovers.""

While passing through town Polly stops into the High-Ho tavern and decides to get a job there as a waitress. Polly has just abandoned her husband and three-year-old daughter while on a beach vacation. What kind of woman does that?

Adam wanders into the High-Ho and gets a job as a cook in the kitchen. He has a reason for being there too- he is watching Polly for a client. Who is the client? Is it Polly's abandoned husband?

Slowly we get more information about Polly. She has a past, and many secrets to hide. She is adept at manipulating people to do what she wants, without them even knowing that they are doing it, and being grateful to help her.

Trouble begins for Adam when he falls in love with Polly. He struggles with his secrets, with his sense of responsibility to his client. Even with what he knows about Polly, he stiil loves her.

Polly has fallen in love with Adam too. Their casual affair becomes serious and then deadly when a death occurs in the town. Was it an accident or murder?

Lippman is at the top of her game with Sunburn. Her inspiration for Sunburn is the work of fellow Baltimore native James M. Cain, whose classic novels include Mildred Pierce, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and Double Indemity. Lippman includes elements from all three novels in her story- an insurance man, illicit lovers, manipulative women, even the restaurant angle- and are all brilliantly woven together in this spellbinding novel.

Sunburn is the perfect book to take on vacation; I read it on a three-hour flight from Florida to New York, and never looked up once until we landed and I had finished the book. The ending is a stunner!

Polly is a fascinating character, as she ""fixes her gaze on the goal and never loses sight of it"". The big question is what exactly is Polly's goal? Crime noir is frequently the purview of male protagonists, so it is intriguing to have a femme fatale running the show.

Sunburn is easily one of the best novels I have read in recent memory, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and good fiction.",1519344000,5

In my case, it was great I got this from the library, instead of wasting money buying it.
This is one of those mystery books that mislead you so that you can't figure out who actually ""done it"". Unfair, IMO. The book was at least 100 pages too long.

7253,432,1839,"Mark Towson, the president of a prominent white fraternity, is accused of a hate crime against a fellow student.  Between local politics, some biased media personnel, and a growing crowd of racial unrest, defense attorney Jack Swyteck has an uphill battle on his hands.  With a client that protests his guilt, and the increasing questions about the possibility of a frame-up, will Jack be able to successfully fight for his client and help to determine the true killer?

Author James Grippando took some liberties with regards to law enforcement procedures and court proceedings, giving the book an overexaggerated feel.  I have read all of the Jack Swyteck novels thus far and A Death in Live Oak is more of the same.  There is very little character development and the story just plodded along.  The character is becoming stale once again and it is time for the author to shake things up.  Readers who are new to the series will not have any problems reading this book, although I do recommend starting the novels from the inception of the character.  Jack Swyteck has quite the history and the nuances of his character are lost if readers do not start with the earlier books.",1519430400,3
7254,1133,464,"I personally really enjoyed this book - hence the 4 star rating.

I always like a good self help book. I think that in today's society we care wayyyyy too much about what other people think and we tend to take on other people's emotions when we don't need to. This book covers all of that and more. We care so much about what other people think and feel that it's basically making us emotional wrecks.

I learned this lesson a bit ago but a main point of this book is that We always chose how we feel . Other people may do things that create an emotion in us however you are always responsible for how you feel and how you handle thing. Believe me, once I understood this my life changed significantly for the better.

Don't care so much about what other people think, be kind and choose to be happy. If you follow these principles you will be golden. If you need some more convincing, pick up The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life.",1519430400,4
7255,1133,1510,"I took a break from mysteries/thrillers just to give my mind a break. I felt like I had been reading similar stores over and over again but I'm glad I picked this one up as my next suspense novel.

We meet Rachel and you find out she may have had a troubled past and she has a child, Spencer. She hasn't had *that* much luck with men until Jason comes along. Jason is a NYU professor and also works with a Media company. They were truly living the NYC dream. The story starts out similar to other thriller suspense (view spoiler) however I think the stillness that Rachel has about this is what got me the most. She is almost calm about it all, kind of like she expected it to happen?

There was something about The Wife that kept me intrigued the whole time. I think I was expecting the whole husband has a powerful job, he cheats on wife with a mistress, there's some domestic abuse, etc. However this was different from that. I think that this story focused more on Rachel's side of things and almost puts her in power in a weird way. Rachel has a destructive past that she is trying to protect both herself and her son from. I had a feeling she may have had a plan all along but she mostly internalized it until the end when we find out what happens.

This book had shorter chapters and I read probably 3/4ths of it yesterday alone. I would definitely recommend picking this book up!",1519430400,5
7256,280,1478,"It has been said that everyone is the star in his or her own story. Nothing could be more true in the case of Jenifer Lewis. This book was raw. What a celebration and testament to a life lived out loud and proud.

My heart ached with her as she recounted the terrible toll of loss after loss of dear friends and loves that has plagued her over the years. I beamed at her accounts of her triumphs.

Jenifer Lewis is a ubiquitous presence in my entertainment life. It just seems that she has always been on my television. Her magnetic presence unrelentingly attracts me. Her timing, voice, delivery and charisma combine to create some of the most memorable scenes that live on in my memory. Her lines are often quoted when recounting or reminiscing about some movie or television series. Seriously, when the camera pans to her, one sits up and takes notice.

Now that I know her story, I am just in awe of her ability to survive and thrive where most would have crawled into a hole and given up.

She recounts her story in fits and starts that sometimes gives me as the reader whiplash. But that's the way we tell our stories, isn't it? One moment I'm reading about an event that occurred in the 80s, next I'm catapulted to the 2000s. I could hear her voice in my head, telling me to pay attention because this is all relevant.

Thank you Ms. Lewis for taking the time to share your story with the world.",1519430400,5

Honor Among Thieves is the first book in a new Young Adult science fiction series set in the future in the year 2142.

The book is divided into four parts.

The narrator is teenager Zara Cole (she is around 17-18). She is a petty criminal who lives on the streets of New Detroit. Her mom and sister live on Mars.

In this world there is something called the Honors. These are people who are selected to travel for a year in outer space. Nobody knows much about what happens to the Honors. But those who are selected are treated like royalty.

There is an Honors Selection Committee. And I actually found everything to do with the Honors to be quite fascinating. Although I think that the most interesting aspect of it is that the Honors travel aboard alien ships. But the ships can communicate and feel things. So essentially they live aboard a living ship.

I really liked the first half of this book a lot. I thought that Zara was an interesting character. The main alien ship featured in this book is Nadim. I definitely thought that Nadim being able to talk and have feelings was intriguing.

Is there romance in this book? This is actually not an easy question to answer. There isn't a traditional romance. But there is a romantic aspect to the story.

The last part of the book was definitely my least favorite. There are battles and fighting and unfortunately I just didn't enjoy this part of the story at all. The first half of the book was 4 stars for me. The concept of the Honors and the alien ships travelling in space was fantastic. Overall, Honor Among Thieves was definitely an interesting first book.

Thanks to edelweiss and Katherine Tegen Books for allowing me to read this book.",1519430400,3
7258,56,594,"This is super short and can be read fairly quickly. I think I did enjoy this more than Borne, but I think it had an added element of horror that sucked me in because horror has sort of always been my go-to genre.

We start by meeting expedition twelve. They are traveling to Area X to find out what the deal is with this strange place where no one lives and no one ever really returns from. No one knows each others names, because names don't matter in Area X. So our MC is known as the biologist, but we also have the psychologist (the leader), the surveyor, and the anthropologist. Upon making base camp, the first thing they notice is a strange tower/tunnel that was not marked on the map. This is strange because when they volunteered they were forced to memorize the map and were drilled on it repeatedly. So they decide to investigate and the expedition starts to go badly.

There is a lot of ambiguity with this plot. Things are left open to the readers imagination and interpretation. Dont pick this up if you're going to need definitive answers. Though I never knew her name (its an all female expedition) I really enjoyed and related to the MC. Shes an extreme introvert, and fascinated by her work and the workings of ecosystems all around her.

There isn't a whole lot to say about the other characters, you don't really get to know them very well. The writing was excellent. I appreciate VanderMeers style in that he takes the weird and makes it poetic somehow. Its weird and its science fiction and its horror but its also literary.

The setting was really well done. It evokes a spooky, haunted feeling, if for no other reason than the biologist is out traveling the marshy wilderness alone. The pacing wasn't super fast, edge of you seat thriller style, but it wasn't slow either and 5 part format made it easy to pick up and put down.

Im definitely going to see the movie- but judging by the trailer it won't have much in common with the book. Id recommend this to fans of VamderMeers other work, or people who like horror in general.",1519430400,4

Sometimes a sanctuary, sometimes a prison, that house on the hill has always been my home.  Ive spent my life yearning toward it, wanting to escape it, paralyzed by its hold on me.  (There are many ways to be crippled, Ive learned over the years, many forms of paralysis.)  You can never escape the bonds of family history, no matter how far you travel.  And the skeleton of a house can carry in its bones the marrow of all that came before.

It is a terrible thing to find the love of your life, Christina You know too well what you're missing when its gone.

The day we bury her is dreary: a colorless sky, gray-boned trees, old sooty snow.  Winter, I think, must be tired of itself.

 I put my hand over his, and he lays his other hand over mine.  I feel the way I do when I lose something  a spool of thread, say  and search for it everywhere, only to discover it in an obvious place, like on the sideboard under the cloth.

My Review:

This was my first exposure to Christina Baker Klines talents and I became an instant devotee.  The writing was emotive and often tinged with melancholy, lushly descriptive, thoughtfully observant, cunningly crafted, and intricately detailed.  A fascinating mix of fact and fiction, I have since spent far too much time Googling Christina Olson and Andrew Wyeths iconic artwork.  I was immediately immersed in this beautifully and insightfully written book from the first person POV of Christina, a girl/woman with few options and limited mobility.  Christina lived her entire life in the same house with her slightly odd family in small-town rural Maine and had continued to live under extremely harsh conditions without indoor plumbing, running water, or electricity, long after others in her area were enjoying these luxuries.

Christina was possibly the most obstinate woman of her time.  Unsteady on her weak limbs following an life-threatening and undiagnosed illness at the age of three, she despised pity, denied most offers of assistance despite frequent mishaps and injuries from falls, refused to seek medical assistance when offered, and in her later years when her legs were no longer of use to her she steadfastly refused to use a wheelchair and drug herself by her elbows, up and down stairs and even across fields to visit her neighbor.  I ached for her and wanted to pop her in the back of the head at the same time for her stubborn pride.",1519430400,5

7262,1133,1062,"I personally really enjoyed The Last Mrs. Parrish. I know that some people didn't like it based on the outcome of certain events but I didn't find it as disturbing since it was classified as a psychological thriller.

At first we meet Amber and honestly I thought she was pretty annoying. She didn't appreciate anything in her life and just wanted to have a completely different life but honestly her life wasn't that bad. She ""bumps"" into the woman she's been admiring from afar at the gym one day and they become fast friends. Little do we know they both want the other one currently has. Without giving too much away, one comes out of the story the way she's hoping and the other *thinks* she is coming out the way she wants to but ends up totally blindsided.

I think that the Last Mrs. Parrish tackles some pretty brutal issues. It's interesting how Money and Wealth can make someone feel like they have so much power and they are so smart but yet they can still get manipulated.

I'd really love if Liv Constantine wrote a follow up to this book. I'd be really interested in hearing what happens with Amber and Daphne. Somethings tells me their paths may end up crossing again...",1519430400,4

7264,1133,21,"I had really high hopes going into this book. A lot of people had recommended it to me so I was really looking forward to it. Honestly? it fell short of what I was really hoping to get out of it. It was good, but it certainly wasn't what others around me had hyped it up to be.

We meet Adele and Louise and of course they form an unlikely friendship. We see the same type of story where we think there may be abuse going on within Adele's marriage but there is also a large presence of intense dreaming. Adele and Louise bond over this and they meet to discuss and help each other with this.

You think you know Adele, Louise thinks she knows Adele but in the last 50 or so pages everything changes.

There are things about this book that I just didn't understand. I think the author put a bit of science fiction/fantasy in there and that just didn't jive with a psychological thriller, in my opinion.

7267,1132,96,"Before I begin this review, I'm going to apologize. Yes, I am sorry because I finished this book a couple of hours ago and instead of writing my review and giving this book a rating it deserves... I watched the movie. Yup, as soon as I finished this audiobook I had dinner and then turned on my TV and watched the movie on HBO. I'm not ashamed of my action but I needed to watch the movie because I heard it was amazing and I, of course, love to compare movies to books and vice versa.

I loved both the book and the movie EQUALLY.

Now onto the review:

Even though I graduated with a Bachelors in Economics - I really do hate math. I was kind of hesitant to read this book/watch this movie because I was expecting people just talking in numbers and equations the whole entire time. I would eventually get super bored and walk away.

HOWEVER, that did not happen. Nope, the audio book was amazing and kept my interest the entire time. Trust me work can get very boring when you are looking at the same screen and doing the same thing every damn day. So.. yeah, this book definitely kept my entertained.

I loved everything about the girls in this book. I loved how they had dreams and didn't stay put in their ruts. No they wanted to be treated equally. They had degrees. They were beyond smart. They wanted their future to grow within NASA. I approved and applauded these girls for dreaming theses magnificent goals and then freaking achieving them.

Besides that, this book made me sad in some parts and so did the movie. This takes place in good ole VA, where I live and have lived for all of my life (so far). Now I wasn't alive back in the 50s/60s era (like my parents) but that doesn't mean I approve of how everyone lived back then either. Nope, not one bit. It breaks my heart that people lived and acted like this and it made me appreciate these smart, strong, and beautiful women for sticking up for themselves and each other. I wish I would have known them personally because I would hug the shit out of them.

Now I don't want to go into great detail about what happened throughout this book because honestly people should read it. I'm surprised it took me this long to finally break this book open. I fell in love with every character and their story. I loved how everything was all tied up in a pretty bow. It definitely changed my life and I hope it will change yours too.",1519430400,5

7270,367,793,"The Complete Maus is a Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel by American editor and comics artist, Art Spiegelman. It is a memoir in comic form that documents recollections of the holocaust, as told by Spiegelmans father, Polish Jew Wadysaw (Zeev/Wladek/Vladek) Spiegelman. The story itself is one that has been told countless times, but Spiegelmans treatment of it makes it unique. As well as his fathers recollections, he illustrates the passing of the story between father and son, thus inserting himself (including his impatience and ingratitude) into the story.

Maus I (My Father Bleeds History) runs from mid-1930s to winter 1944 and details his parents courtship and their experience of the war, through the German occupation and being rounded up to live in the ghetto, up until they were taken to Auschwitz.

Maus II (And here my troubles began) is divided into five chapters and runs from winter 1944 until the immediate post-war period, with Arties history taking finishing with his fathers death. It covers his parents time in Auschwitz, displacement camps and their eventual reunion.

As with all graphic novels, it can be difficult to distinguish between characters, especially when most of them have the head of a mouse, and sometimes the speech balloons are so small that they make reading the dialogue a challenge, particularly for readers of a certain vintage. But it is immediately clear that a great deal of work has gone into this work, and Spiegelman is obviously a very talented graphic artist, telling an important story.",1519430400,4

Not to mention there was a series creep factor regarding the Tombs itself. The story was interesting and engaging, and there were genuinely sweet moments that pulled at my heartstrings. I could barely stop reading for any reason! That's not to say there aren't a couple flaws. A love triangle spawned out of nowhere and I'm not sure I buy into it, the pacing was a little wonky at times, and again, I need more stories because of that ending.

It's one of those books that somehow will hook you in and before you know it .. well, the book is over. Done. It has officially ended, unless you flipped it around and started all over again.

You see it in all animals - the female of the species is more deadly than the male.

I freaking love that quote and even though I saw someone else use it in their review - I still wanted to use it. I mean, women are savage. Our best friend is basically karma. You mess with one female, you basically mess with them all.

Besides loving this book for what it was, well.. it was cliche as heck. Cliche characters that you end up loving. I know that sentence is probably making you make a face and think I'm completely crazy - but trust me when you read the book it will probably make sense to you.

Overall, I really liked the book. Alex was probably my favorite character out of all of them. However, you can't help but like the bitchy mean girl, the jocks, and the super religious girl. I loved them all, not equally, but I still ended up loving them.

I can definitely see myself rereading this book over and over again. I just really liked it. I swear I did. Seriously, go read this book people.",1519430400,5
7276,1133,819,"This may be the best thriller I've ever read. I absolutely loved the short chapters and it really kept me engaged. I know this was highly anticipated for this year and I definitely think it deserves the praise it got. I am amazed this was the Author's debut novel but he did an outstanding job.

This book tackles issues from a very interesting perspective: a child psychologist. However the child psychologist is the person who also can't leave the house and who had such a traumatic family experience happen to her that it's easy for people to tell her she's just crazy. Since she's afraid to leave the house, she watches people across the street and observes them. One day she thinks she see's something. Could it be the husband? Could it be her downstairs tenant? Who is that women? Why is their Child visiting me with cookies? What woman came to my house? All these questions kept going through my head as I was reading.

The author crafted the characters in such a way that you think you know what has happened and it's your typical husband/wife domestic abuse case but you may be very surprised...

I definitely didn't see the ending coming the way it did.

I heard this is becoming a movie and I will definitely go see that. I hope they keep it pretty close to the book.

I highly recommend if you love fast paced psychological thrillers.",1519430400,5
7277,1132,984,"I've said it before and I will continue to say it (unless it's the princess diaries series!): I FREAKING LOVE NOVELLAS!!<3<3<3

I just wish this novella came out BEFORE I read all of the previous books BECAUSE now I want to reread all of them AGAIN. Which I'm not complaining at all because I loved the books before so I wouldn't mind rereading them but I need to read new books, series, and authors! DAMN YOU KENDARE BLAKE!

Oh, uh.. spoilers below? beware? don't read? idk?

Okay, so The Young Queens brings in their mother and father, Camille and Philippe.

I DON'T CARE WHEN THESE BABIES WERE BORN BUT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TORN AWAY FROM THEIR GOD DAMN PARENTS! and no I wasn't crying.. I was cutting onions or something. And that's not even the first crack in my heart! NO, Kendare brings more pain and tears into my life because we get to see the triplets growing up together for like a hot god damn second before they are torn away from each other. THESE PEOPLE ARE VICIOUS AND SAVAGES. DAMN THEM ALL!

Now we all know that Arsinoe got the way better deal than her other sisters. Katharine is still my favorite out of the three but I just couldn't stop crying because of what she went through. I wanted to dive into the book and kill all of those people poisoning her. But in the end, she's a savage and I love her with all of my heart. The other two sisters mean nothing to me.

Overall, a great novella and addition to this already awesome and amazing series. I can't wait for the next book to come out because I just know that I will devour it.",1519430400,5
7278,1132,2,"So I may or may not still be freaking out after I finished this book. Seriously, I have no idea. DO I EVEN HAVE A PULSE RIGHT NOW? Who knows.

Ever since I wanted my first SNL episode and saw Tina Fey and Amy Poehler - well, uh.. I've been in love. If one day these two just walk into my life super randomly and want to hang out or be best friends five-ever (because that's obviously longer than forever -duh!). Well, I'd be one hundred percent down for allllll of that awesomeness. However, my dreams will forever remain unreachable because they will probably never want to hang out with a 26 year old.

Back to this book - it was amazing. Yeah, it really was and I probably say that a whole bunch of times when I'm reading books or whatever. It's true - it always is. I love books and Yes Please had me constantly laughing/crying at work. No, it wasn't to my black right eye or that my face was in pain. Nope, this book was just hilarious to me.

I've also come to realize that I haven't watched every show/movie that Amy has been in. Yes to SNL, baby momma, mean girls.. and I can't tell if there have been more but I will probably need to dive into her other stuff. I need more of Amy in my life.

Before I end this review, I really liked hearing about her crazy life. Finding it pretty relatable even though I haven't gone through like half of that stuff. Overall, a great book and I highly recommend the audio version.",1519430400,5

Synopsis: The Giver, the 1994 Newbery Medal winner, has become one of the most influential novels of our time. The haunting story centers on twelve-year-old Jonas, who lives in a seemingly ideal, if colorless, world of conformity and contentment. Not until he is given his life assignment as the Receiver of Memory does he begin to understand the dark, complex secrets behind his fragile community. Lois Lowry has written three companion novels to The Giver, including Gathering Blue, Messenger, and Son.

My husband has been bugging me since we got together to read this book, so I finally took the plunge and read it (since I found it unfair he reads the books I give him to read and I don't read any he gives me). Andddd I really liked it! The character development was really good for such a short book, I felt I connected with Jonas and the other important side characters. I felt very invested in Jonas struggle and everyone elses non-struggle lol. I cant give a lot away so that sentence won't make sense. The book also had an amazing storyline and plot. You can tell that Veronica Roth got a lot of inspiration from this book for at least Divergent and for this book to be one of the first really popular YA dystopians it was really good.

However, I did feel that there could have been points that could have improved this book. This book didn't have great world building. The world was confusing and you're left in the end with more questions than answers, especially in how a certain act was done and where the main character is going at the end. The pacing of this book and the timeline is also confusing. At times the book skips months ahead, but you don't know until the time is mentioned. The biggest factor in this is baby Gabe who has a very confusing timeline throughout the whole of the book. I think if this whole book could be rewritten with exact timelines and descriptive world building then this book would be the best Dystopian ever in my opinion, but maybe there is more info in the other books of this series.

Verdict: World building is key for a dystopian novel, especially if set in the future. Also stillings are a thing in this book and its hilarious to me.",1519516800,4

Although very short, I think it is a masterpiece. I consider it his best book. It is a book about human dignity, about love, about respect for people and all of creation, and it is about the constant human struggle.

7286,198,132,"Based on several actual people and wartime occurrences from both World Wars, this book truly will make you bow your head to the incredibly brave women who carried messages back and forth across enemy lines in German-occupied France. Part of the book revolves around atrocities in WWII, but much of it centers around the unknown heroism of an earlier group of female spies in WWI known as The Alice Network, operating without a safety net so to speak, in a time with little technology, relying only on their wits and each other. The melodrama, especially in the WWI chapters, is held to a minimum as the women involved face the casual, horrific cruelties of war with grit and pragmatic determination. This is an excellent book, and the authors notes at the end are an important inclusion to the reality she brings to light. Well worth the read.",1519516800,5
7287,350,138,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I read A Grown-Up Kind of Pretty by the same author back in 2012 and enjoyed that as well.  I usually reserve my 5 star ratings for books that tell a great story and have superior writing and use of language.  While the writing here is not spectacular, it is good and well suited to the story.  I am giving this 5 stars because I enjoyed the book so much.

Leia Birch Briggs is a young woman who has written and illustrated a successful comic book about a naive girl named Violet and the female superhero named Violence who repeatedly saves her.  While attending a Comic-Con like event, she gets drunk and hooks up with a guy in a Batman suit.  She finds out she is pregnant just as the important people in her life are falling apart.  Her perfect step-sisters perfect marriage is crumbling.  Worse yet, her beloved paternal grandmother Birchie has Lewy Body Dementia.  Birchie and her best friend Wattie have been covering up the illness for some time.  Birchie causes a stir at her local church when she blurts out some embarrassing news about a couple of the townspeople.  Leia packs up and returns to small town Alabama to move the old ladies into assisted living.  They fight her because they are hiding some big secrets of their own in the attic.

The author portrays race and social class relationships in the south, both past and present.  Birchie is from the most prominent family in town.  Her friend since childhood is African American.  They live together and protect each other in amazing ways.  When it appears that Birchie committed a terrible crime, the town is divided, but family loyalty never falters.  Leias Batman is also African American and she fears telling her family that she is having a bi-racial baby from a one-night stand.  She does not plan to tell the father either.

I really enjoyed all the main characters.  They were believable and human.  Leia has a wonderful voice as the narrator.  She is smart, funny, snarky, and eventually wise in equal measures. The characters in her comic book have some interesting parallels to real life.  Leia always thought that she was naive Violet, but she finds out that she has a lot of Violence in her when she takes risks to protect her family.  Through Leias eyes we see the subtle and not-so-subtle prejudices that still exist in our country.  The book has a happy ending, but still leaves some loose ends which makes it more realistic.  Great characters, great story, great narrative voice, great book!",1519516800,5

7291,394,616,"This review is for ISBN 9781481542265 the Overdrive/audio version.

Ralph Cosham was the narrator of the edition I was able to obtain from the Overdrive library. I know it can't be very interesting reading letters. There were no characters to play or give variety to the story. So I can't say if he was good at what he did or not. I just found it BORING! Like a guy reading letters.

I read this a million years ago as a teen/young adult. I can sincerely say that it was the C.S. Lewis books that gave me my healthy agonistic views. They still stand, so those of you that praise the man really haven't read his fiction. These were on my mother's approved list along with Pilgrim's Progress. The sci-fi was excellent. And are there, like all sci-fi, to make a person think. This book was clever in its format of letters to tell the advice, though from a negative viewpoint. This may be the Cobert Report of its time. I understand sarcasm but I find it the least effective way to prove a point. I think I liked it more as a young person. Now I just couldn't get into it or find anything redeeming. Now I was just bored, clever negative letters aside. And it was overwhelmingly male.

It is, on the other hand, a bit of a depiction of World War II and the men who fought it in, like my dad. Much reflected tales he told of his own journeys in war. How easy it is to forget the lessons we learned as children when faced with constant death and killing.

It's worth the read. Just not a second time.",1519516800,3

So, when I find something capable of punching through all the noise; that continues to live in my head even after closing the book; I have found my nirvana. This book, heck this whole series, has done that with grace and elegance. The characters are multi-dimensional, complex, and dynamic. As are their interactions and relationships. The secondary characters aren't secondary in their development. They are just as individual and memorable as their main counterparts. There is logic and reason behind every action. A villain isn't a villain just because he (or she) is insane; theres a carefully calculated plan driving everything. I love that no matter how powerful an enemy is, there is a weakness that can be used to defeat them; that Nevada and Rogan aren't all-powerful either. I appreciate that that Nevada and Rogan have their own personal rules of engagement during combat and they stick to them. I am extremely grateful that I was able to read the three books that currently make up this series back to back, and Im now bereft that I have to wait for the next one to be released.

7300,1045,957,"This is set in a world of black and white and grey all over. This is Good and Evil and the eternal struggle to balance/rectify the two both in the world and in ourselves. In a land where being a recounter of tales, a lover of lore and a spinner of the yarns of old...where words hold the power to seduce even the most Amazing/violent of creatures...they can harm or heal.. they even might have the power to kill (?) What would you do with such power? Who would you be? What is the very nature of said Power and how does it contribute to the timeless battle between Good & Evil?

I wanted to put this down SO many times, to traipse off with another tantalizing book that caught my eye but each time I sat back down and gave it another try I got caught up for hours and was transported somewhere amazing/cruel/imaginative etc...in the end what more can we ask for from a collection of words on a page/screen? The writing was nice and comfy. It did not stretch the mind into uncomfortable positions just to comprehend what was happening. It also was not simple, base or crude. It felt like how I would describe southern cooking feels like on a depressingly cold winter's day, slow, comfortable, like aaaaahhhhhhh.

I liked every aspect of the plotline from the amazing depiction of Dragons to the awful dichotomies of family, court and social prejudice. The author traversed themes such as how much we allow other people's views/actions define who/what we believe ourselves to be? How difficult it is to shuck off negative beliefs about ourselves and become the best version of ourselves. How much do we let predjudices define how & who we interact and connect with? How much must we give up to be true to ourselves? What would some people do to have/keep the Power? Can you be Good if you have done bad things?... and more.

7309,767,1872,"A sunburn isn't harmless so why would a book entitled SUNBURN be anything but innocent. When it comes to a new thriller by Laura Lippmann, nothing is at it seems. A man meets a woman in a small-town bar as he is drawn to her back, which has clearly been out in the sun too long. Does she notice the way he is looking at her? There is no way you won't get wrapped up in the walking on eggshells dialogue, not-to-be-trusted dance that Polly and Adam do with each other as they tangle in the beach town of Belleville just outside of Baltimore. One is looking for the other, the other is trying not to be found. With many shady, not as in staying out of the sun, characters, embroiled in each others mess.

Lippmann has a wonderful way of weaving a plot line not only to keep you interested but to keep you guessing. You need your detective skills as much as you need to watch each characters back as if it were your own. People who neglect their own, as in children, treat human life as if its disposable, note the theme of burn as in sun and fire, and love that can turn on a dime. Hey, thats the stuff that makes movies so much fun to watch. And, books such a pleasure to read.

7314,1029,17,"For starters, lets talk world building, tone, style, and all that jazz.

Elley: The setting is Mayfair in London during the Regency period. I love the backstories for both Emma and Ash, and Tessa Dare always right such delightful, witty, fun romances. Once I got going with this book I had a really hard time putting it down.
Ariel: Tessa Dare did a great job in this one of creating a wonderful atmosphere, both in Ashs residence, and the way she held to the distinction of different class systems without making any of the characters snobbish or jerks about anything. I always do appreciate a sassy butler too, which Ash certainly had. Someone give that butler his own book! Make him a recurring character

OK, now for the good stuff: let's talk main characters and their love story!

Elley: I love me a damaged man with a heart of gold. While other girls were dreaming of Prince Charming and pretending to be Cinderella, I was watching The Hunchback of Notre Dame and swooning over Quasimodo. I also preferred the Beast over his transformation into Prince Adam. So obviously I fell immediately head over heels for Ash.
Ariel: When I initially read the description, I was concerned that Ash would be kind of a brooding alpha-hole, or that he would be so bogged down in his personal woes that he wouldnt have any other personality. But it turns out I LOVED his personality! He maintained a great rapport with Emma, had the right amount of brood without getting over the top. I appreciated Emmas spunk, and her ability to stand up for herself.
Elley: Oh my gosh, I loved Emma! I like that shes so sexually free in a time when women were supposed to just lie there and let their husband do his thing. Yeah, baby! And yeah, shes definitely got gumption. Can you imagine striding into the residence of a duke wearing a dress that looks like a unicorn vomited on it and demanding to be paid? You go girl.
Ariel: I feel like in Regency romance there is a fine line between delicate flower and wanton lady, and Emma manages to walk that line very nicely.

What about those side characters?

Elley: OK, I *loved* Ash's little sidekick, what did he call himself again?
Ariel: I don't remember but he definitely should get his own book. Or at least keep showing up and being adorable. I couldn't totally place his age. Is he old enough to end up with one of the friends? I am 100% here for that.
Elley: I felt like he was more like 11 or 12 or something. But he definitely needs to come back around in future books! I also really liked Ash's servants. I feel like you can tell a lot about a person from how they treat ""the help."" Today that might look like how they treat their waiter or speak to a cashier, and if someone talks to people in the service industry like they're trash they're most likely not a keeper. I think the way Ash's servants interact with him (especially his butler!!) says a lot about his hidden heart of gold.
Ariel: The only thing that bugged me was the the servants are conspiring to hook us up plotline, and the weird maid whose only function was to act like an awkward matchmaker. That seemed a bit forced. But I absolutely loved the butler, and how he was Captain Sass all the time at Ash. I would love to hear more about him.
Elley: Its cute how much they care about their master and want him to be happy and fall in love! OK, yeah, a lot of the matchmaking plotline was weird and out of place. But that BUTLER! I also really loved Emmas circle of strange friends, and I imagine the rest of the books in the series will be about them. Talk about some quirky leading ladies!!
Ariel: I am 100% here for every single quirky book about this friend group, and I hope our favorite masked bandit makes an appearance in all of them.

Overall rating/thoughts?

Elley: I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down once I got started reading it. I give it 5 stars, and cant wait to read the next books in the series!

7318,350,1788,"I listened to this on audiobook through the public library.  I was anticipating that this would be narrated by the author.  Unfortunately, my copy was not.  Listening to Mr. Alda tell his story would have made this a 5 star review for me.  Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable listening experience.

This memoir starts in childhood, growing up with his actor father Robert Alda and his mentally ill mother and his early experience in burlesque houses.  He talks about his education and stint in the military.  He writes about his struggles to break into acting working on stage, in movies, and on television.  He marries and has three daughters.  Of course he writes about his decision to be on M*A*S*H* and some film work after that.  He writes excitedly about his time hosting Scientifc American Frontiers.  He talks about his desire to write and direct and about how he learned to be an actor.  If you are looking for a gossipy Hollywood memoir, you are looking at the wrong book.  Any mention of other actors is kind and sweetly funny.

7320,52,1020,"I'm among the readers who were disappointed with this book. The actual story of Beren and Luthien is only a small portion of the book. I enjoyed it very much though I felt it was more a story for children in the mode of The Hobbit. Most of the book is filled with scraps of other notations made by JRR Tolkien and the usual addendum you find in Tolkien books. I expected something more like The Silmarillion or The Children of Hurin. Also, I'm past the point in my life where I want to write in Dwarvish or runes so deciphering the bits of notations to tie them back to past stories doesn't interest me.",1519603200,3
7321,821,740,"I absolutely love The Hobbit, but this particular edition is smaller than I was expecting, which made the print really tiny. Though I very much like Tolkien's cover art, the interior of the book felt cheap, with thin paper and low quality printing.",1519603200,3

7324,967,961,"You know when you are wanting some greasy salty potato chips but you don't have any, but you've got a pack of plain saltines, and since they're the closest thing you've got, you eat them even though you know they're not going to be nearly as good? And you bite down only to discover they're stale?
That's how this book was for me. A poor, tasteless, substitution for what could have been a rich, colorful story.
I typically prefer Southern literature above all other genres. I even had the pleasure of meeting this author the other day. I'm just so thankful I had already purchased this Kindle book for $1.99. Because I probably would have cried my eyes out had I paid $26.95.
Poor Ella May. Poor children. Poor Yankees, millworkers, law dogs, displaced mountain people, and all small minded individuals. There was a whole lot to root for in this book, but it's all heartbreaking. Her story needed to be told, but I just feel like we learned about her in jumps and starts and it was hard to remember who was who as we read different perspectives from chapter to chapter. I still don't know what to think, but I'm apt to believe all the same problems still exist.",1519689600,2
7325,56,1886,"Im giving it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. This is a murder mystery set on the moon. Moon related fiction seems to be a popular trend right now, but Im not complaining.

The writing in this book was excellent. The author does a very good job of expressing the cold desolate landscape. He described various ridges, the way the moon dust levitates in the air as night turns to day, and lets not forget the smell. Moon dust smells like cordite, or more simply, gunpowder. Hence the name, Gunpowder Moon, and for whatever reason the title and the description really stuck with me through the novel.

I also enjoyed the characters. They were mostly men, but I guess in a world where no women have actually set foot on the moon yet (ahem) I shouldnt be all that surprised. The one woman, Lane, had a pretty major role and wasn't cast in a stereotypical way. She was strong and fearless and makes smart decisions. I enjoyed her character arc as well as the arc of the main character, Dechert. My only complaint with Dechert was that I never really got a sense of how old he was. I kept thinking of him as an old man because he was a grizzled war veteran, but upon reflection I get the feeling he was supposed to be about middle aged.  He felt very human to me. Flawed and sort of tragic.

For you hard sci-fi lovers, there was plenty of science to go around. They are mining for HE-3 deposits. Theres talk of magnetic fields and g forces and .6 gravity etc. I did find this slowed the pace occasionally because the science was above my head. (Also- I read another review on Amazon that said the science was not entirely accurate, I cant comment on this because I wouldnt know enough to tell you either way.)

On to the story itself, there were things I liked and things I didnt. To start with, I didn't really feel like this was set far enough in the future to suspend my disbelief that apocalypse level climate change happened everywhere, leading nations became the new third world nations, wars broke out, and then lunar He-3 deposits are discovered as the answer to all the worlds problems.  The other result of this mini apocalypse- is apparently that everyone is suddenly very theistic (and America is of course very Christian, and top brass doesnt really like when the people working for them arent).  Im not sure where this falls on the plausibility scale. I live under a rock and I know religion isn't going away anytime soon, but to have America just become a bunch of religious zealots didn't sit quite right with me either. (Isnt it equally plausible that they all became atheists in the name of science?)

These are small parts of the book and only detracted from the story as minor annoyances.  I did like the conspiracy theory level mystery. Layers being uncovered one after another. Evidence trickling in from various sources. The need for secure channels and evacuation plans.  I love a good conspiracy theory- so I never mind a trip down the rabbit hole.

Where it lost me again, was the way the mystery was solved. It was too immediate. Too convenient.  Im not a fan of the epiphany as a source of solution.

The action scenes were a blast and I think the author wrote them very well. It was very reminiscent of Star Wars. Shuttles flying blind through canyons and craters, skimming the dusty lunar surface. Navigation via a basic green and black grid. These scenes were show stealers.

To sum it up: excellent writing, fantastic setting, lots of science and human characters made for a good overall story. Id recommend this to readers of hard sci-fi or anyone in the mood for a good lunar tale.

Thank you to Harper Voyager for the ARC!",1519689600,4
7326,315,649,"An unnamed time traveler sees the future of man (802,701 A.D.) and then the inevitable future of the world. He tells his tale in detail. Some of the details are fascinating as the traveler come to discover the secret of the results of social striation over centuries which eventually creates two separate species from humans. Which species is the more human? Can anything be done to prevent or correct this?

I grew up on the Rod Taylor /George Pal movie. When I started the book, I expected it to be slightly different with a tad more complexity as with most book/movie relationships. I was surprised to find the reason for the breakup of species (Morlock and Eloi) was class Vs atomic (in later movie versions it was political). I could live with that but to find that some little pink thing replaced Yvette Mimieux was too much.

After all the surprises we can look at the story as unique in its time, first published in 1895, yet the message is timeless. The writing and timing could not have been better. And the ending was certainly appropriate for the world that he describes. Possibly, if the story were written today the species division would be based on eugenics.",1519689600,5

Richard Henry Dana suffered from measles while a student at Harvard in 1834. Rather than suffer a slow recovery from weakened eyesight, he shipped out as a common sailor, rather than as a passenger, on a long sea voyage. After becoming a lawyer, he published his recollection of his voyage in 1840; it was an immediate success. He became an active member of the Free Soil Party, and represented fugitive slaves. This first and greatest book shows his sympathy for the suffering and the oppressed, and his courage, unselfishness, and fair-mindedness that characterized his life. This important book describes California before statehood and the gold rush, and life in those times. RHD hoped this book would promote religion and moral improvement for seamen, and diminish their hardships.

Chapter IV tells of being chased by a black hulled ship that flew no colors. They were able to outrun this ship, then lost it in the dark. Chapter V tells of the bad weather while rounding Cape Horn. They passed a whaler from Poughkeepsie NY. Chapter XIII gives his impressions of the Californians. RHD knew that local officials were appointed from the capital, but didn't ask if they controlled the local economy as a colony: produce raw material, buy finished goods. Chapter XVII tells how their captain, known for his flogging, could not hire any new seamen. Chapter XVIII tells of Easter celebration in California. The crews of Catholic vessels get about three more weeks of vacation in a year, and ""Yankees don't keep Christmas"". Chapter XXI tells more about California politics. Since the independence of Mexico the missions and their lands became the prey of administradores, and became diminished and decayed. RHD describes the lack of common law, and the private morality. It was a rich country waiting to be exploited.

Chapter XXIII tells of the advantages of a bigger ship over a smaller ship: more hands make lighter work. But a smaller lighter ship can catch a slight breeze that becalms a bigger ship. Chapter XXV tells how the heavy import taxes of Mexico are handled. A vessel puts in to declare a moderate cargo, then sells a large part. It then sails to another port; but on the way it gets other goods to replenish its cargo. RHD describes his visit to a whaleship, whose crew resembled fishermen and farmers. [Whalers got a share of the profits, not a wage.] The chapter ends with a description of a 3-day gale. Chapter XXIX tells of preparations to sail home: ballast is dumped, the ship sealed and fumigated to kill vermin. Then the hides are loaded, then steeved to pack in more. This hard work was fueled by a constant diet of fresh beef. Chapter XXX tells of the return trip by a shorthanded and inexperienced crew; they would round Cape Horn in the dead of winter, the worst possible time. Chapter XXXI tells of the sailor's need for rum or hot coffee in wintertime; and what it is like to have a tooth-ache at sea. Chapter XXXII describes the terrible times in the iceberg fields. Chapter XXXV tells of the haste to get home by keeping sails aloft. Scurvy had broken out on the ship due to no fresh provisions. They met a brig and got potatoes and onions for a cure.

The Concluding Chapter tells that drudgery and hardship is a sailor's life, not romantic fantasies. The captain must control everything, and be responsible for everything (mistreatment of seamen). Passengers on board (independent witnesses) result in better treatment of seamen. The lives of merchant seamen are shortened by a lack of sleep. RHD would not abolish flogging: most seamen are foreigners, the cast-offs of war vessels, and unknown to the captains. Force is needed to control them. Gradual improvement will correct this, he claims. RHD strongly objects to the practice of granting leniency to a convicted captain or officer because of previous good character, or a family to support.

7333,810,1892,"Sophie Graham had a wonderful life  two loving parents, travel, meeting varied and interesting people  until those parents died of consumption when she was twelve years old. Her grandfather was an awful person who had disowned his son (Sophies father) because he married the woman he loved rather than marry as his father wanted. That cold and unfeeling man became Sophies guardian. He certainly didn't want her or anything to do with her so he took her to Miss Uptons Academy For Young Ladies and left her. He made sure that she understood she was not welcome in his home and would not be coming there for holidays nor would he pay her tuition past the age of eighteen  after eighteen, she would be totally on her own. Sophie made two wonderful friends (Miss Eliza Cross and Lady Georgiana Lucas) at that school and they remained her staunch supporters. Lovely, accomplished and intelligent, Sophie understood quite quickly that the only person she could depend upon to take care of her was herself and she set out to make her fortune and hopefully find a nice decent man with whom to make a family.

You have to admire Sophie because she managed to take care of herself from the time she was twelve. She became strong and independent  and she had a plan. She was going to London as the widow Mrs. Sophie Campbell, and she was going to use her greatest skill to make her fortune. That skill was playing cards and she had learned it at her fathers knee, learning to figure the odds, game rules, etc. She rarely lost. Her goal was to gain a fortune of ten-thousand pounds because that should be enough to help her attract an upstanding gentleman as her suitor. Then, shed marry and start a family. That plan was going well  she already had four-thousand pounds in her account  but then she lost the biggest bet of her young life!

Jack Lindeville, Duke of Ware, is weighed down by his responsibilities  to the dukedom, his mother, his brother and even the daughter and widow of his fathers best friend. Once upon a time, he had been a fun-loving and happy young man who laughed and enjoyed his life. Then, his father died after a boating accident and duty called with its stifling weight. Now, all Jack does is work and try to control his brother, Phillip, to keep him from running up massive gambling debts. Jack has become cold and hard as granite  and he has no idea how lonely he is. ** Note here -- Jack's mother is a piece of work. If he controlled her, he wouldn't have too much trouble in controlling Philip. -- Just sayin' **

Phillips favorite place to gamble is the Vega Club because of the ambiance and the presence of the lovely Mrs. Campbell. He loses regularly to Mrs. Campbell, but he also loses to many others at the club. One large loss of Phillip's is the last straw for Jack. His temper is flaring when he arrives at the Vega Club to pay off Phillips debt and finds said brother at the tables when he had just promised to stay away from gambling for a month. Jack is incensed and decides hell teach Philip a lesson  then he really loses that temper and wagers himself. He certainly doesnt expect to win the wager and is aghast when he wins  because he has won the company of the lovely Mrs. Campbell for a week. What in the world is he going to do? Why  hes going to abscond with her to Alwyn, his favorite home  where they are stranded by a rainstorm. He cant take her back to London because the roads are impassable and the coach has a broken axle.

Jack and Sophie are in for an emotional ride. Watching two determined, smart and independent people work their way through their budding feelings, trying to stay away from each other and coming to terms with their feelings is nerve-wracking. Can they overcome Jacks mother and her plotting? Can they curb Phillip's gambling and his animosity toward Jack? Can they really find their HEA? Youll just have to read this lovely book to find all of the answers.

This book captured me from the start. The author wastes no time bringing these characters together. You could feel their passion from their first meeting.

I could easily picture a sweet young girl, Sophie, who recently lost her family and is sent away to school by her grandfather. She is full of determination, whit and knows what she needs to do to survive. Upon leaving the school she chooses an unconventional path for lady. It's at Club Vega where her luck continues to improve.

The Duke of Ware, Jack, is known for being cold and unemotional but he losses his head when he meets Sophie. Their time spent together helped changed Ware into Jack. A sweet but charming man.

They didn't have an easy path once they left the comforts of Alwyn and had to return to obligations and secrecy. The author kept the drama to a minimum but I felt that it was enough to keep the story flowing.

She wrapped up their story perfectly and gave us intrigue to a new London adventure.

7337,889,1893,"ARC provided by the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.*

Ana had never believed much in the Goddess. She only knew the origin story, as sweet as a bedtime lullaby. How, in a kingdom of shadows, the queen bore a daughter of light who chased the Dark away.

Heart of Iron had all the potential in the world to be my new favorite book. Basically, its a new and unique Anastasia retelling but set in space with a crew of outlaws who end up entwined in secrets and mysteries! We follow four points of view:

Ana - Our true main character, who is on a mission to find a new robot body for D09. Also, she's a PoC!
D09 - A Robot who is in desperate need of a new memory core and keeps malfunctioning.
Robb - The next biggest character, whose brother is going to be Emperor, but he is too busy searching for his father that was pronounced dead seven years ago. Robb is also a PoC and not straight!
Jax - The pilot of the crew he and Ana travel with. He is a different race than human, and his ancestors had the power to see the future in the stars. And he is also not straight! Jax is EASILY my favorite character in this entire book.

Ana and Robbs paths cross, because they are both after the same coordinates. Robb wants them in hopes of finding out what happened to his father seven years ago, when a rebellion happened that set fire to the royal family and left them all for dead, even though they never found the body of the young princess. Ana wants them in hopes of finding a new body for D09, the robot she is in love with, even though he cant process or feel feelings, and she will jeopardize her crews other missions to try, because it is almost impossible for Ana to find a new body or parts.

Robots in this world were created to treat the infected people of a plague twenty years ago, but as I stated above, seven years ago a rebellion happened and now the only robots that people trust are the ones that are hived or mind controlled as the Iron Kingdom army, and they are called Messiers.

Meanwhile, back in Nevaeh, where many of the other royal families reside, Robbs brother, Erik, is about to be anointed Emperor. The crown is said to be made of the Goddess heart, and only the worthy can wear it without it immediately rusting. And by worthy, I mean only the Armorov bloodline can, but they all died in the fire seven years ago.

All stories are built from the bones of something true. You are the daughter of iron and stars. You are the symbol of hope in a time when light only shines from things that burn.

If you guys have seen Anastasia before, you probably can guess how this plays out. But overall, I do think the story is pretty good. Also, there are some 5/5 twists at the end of this book. Sadly, the four points of view switch constantly, with very little pages or substance per chapter, and it made for such a disjointed read. Im not sure if this is just the new trend with YA Sci-Fi, but I felt the very same when I read Zenith. It completely ruined the reading experience for me, and I had such a hard time connecting to the characters and to their relationships.

Ana and D09s relationship was just too much for me in the first half. I didn't enjoy it at all, and it had nothing to do with him being a robot, it was that he was a robot that didn't feel things. I would have so much preferred them to just have a friendship. Im not entirely sure, I just really wasn't feeling their love story from the start, but I do have high hopes if we do get another book in this world!

Robb and Jaxs sexuality is never stated on page, but they are for sure LGBTQIAP+. They are probably both gay, but my pansexual self never wants to erase any sexuality. But I loved these characters representation and their story lines were for sure the strongest in the entire book. Oh, and their banter and jokes with each other was so freakin pure and wonderful. And, Ill be over here melting into a puddle on the ground and swooning forever, bye.

I will say that there was a somewhat triggering comment made in passing about how Robb was in a relationship with a boy that ended up killing himself, yet it wasn't very clear. Regardless it made me a little uncomfortable, and I think its important to note and use caution going in. Trigger/Content warnings for mention of suicide, abuse, and death.

As for more sexual representation, the captain of the ship, Anas adoptive mother, is a lesbian and married to another woman. Like, this book brings the sexual representation, and Im living for it. And two main characters of color was also such a blessing.

This book does have a major theme spotlighting the importance of found families, and for that I am so very thankful. This book helps solidify that blood is just blood, but people who unconditionally love and accept you will always be family. I did love this constant theme and the many mentions, and for that I was so happy and grateful.

Overall, this is a super fast paced story, that is very easy to get through. And even though I didn't love it, and maybe even felt a little disappointment, because I had such high hopes, I still enjoyed it. Also, there is a lot of good in this book, that Im very thankful for. Also, Ashley Poston seems like such a sweetheart, and after reading this and Geekerella, I will continue to read everything else she writes! Which will hopefully be a sequel to this, because this ending is cruel, and I need answers!

I loved Olivia and Edward. Shes outspoken and goes after what she wants. Hes genuinely good and struggling a bit. Together they have spirited arguments and understanding and omg so much chemistry.

Plot wise it moved decently. There were a few scenes of miscommunication, but they were swiftly addressed and the book has low angst. Again I loved the scenes with Olivias sisters and their loyalty and support. I enjoyed getting little bits of information about the sister from the previous book.

7339,1071,16,"The Hurt U Give (THUG) An important read for younger readers, especially those who have little in common with the characters in this story. It's vital that more people understand the issue of police brutality from the standpoint of those most often in its crosshairs. This book could go a very long way toward achieving that. Woven smartly through the overall theme were issues of family, poverty, community, education, parenting, innocence, and best of all: the worth of those who have been imprisoned portrayed magically through Big Mav.

All of those things are great. I'm thrilled to know people in rural areas are reading it, people all over the world are reading it, that it will be a movie and I will certainly be buying copies for young people in the future, because it's a book that teaches many lessons.

Nonetheless, at times it felt pedantic and laugh-aloud funny with definitions written into the prose for common terms and actions. Because this book is meant to be read widely, hopefully by those who have the least in common with Starr, her awesome family and her community, these moments that pulled me sharply away from the story might be unobtrusive and reassuring to another reader. The problems with these explanations for me was 1) there are too many of them and 2) they are borderline pedantic, and 3) they felt clunky and slowed the pace considerably from an important story.

Here's an example (hang on while I find one...OK back) This is from the part where Chris and Starr are in Seven's car and she sees her neighborhood through what she imagines Chris' eyes to be, ""There's lots of hoopties, cars that should've been in the junk-yard a long time ago."" (Kindle Edition, Chapter 22, p. 379.) Why not simply, ""There's lots of hoopties."" Until just now I didn't realize that wasn't a word everyone would know. I'm 50 and it's been around as long as I can remember. I'm on the opposite coast from this book's setting, so at least in the US, it's not regionally specific.

At those times THUG felt to me like a teaching aid for white people, which it certainly could and should be. Distracting or not, these ""explainers"" mean many more people can enjoy the book (though dictionaries and internet searches never killed anyone.) I thought, frequently, while reading this book that between the strong family setting, the clear love for everyone involved, the excellent manners and picture-perfect characters this would be another great book for white readers to break into the lived black experience. Angie Thomas makes Starr the perfect vehicle for innocent children made into monsters by virtue of skin color and environment.

Along those lines, it seemed a bit too happily ever after too, but once again, I'm reading a book I'm way too old for, and the style is very clearly for young readers. That's not me. It's hard to fault a book for being what it is when I am clearly not the intended reader.

I could quibble more but I won't. I will give this book to the lovers and the marchers and the peacemakers and the many I hope will learn from it. (I'm praying the banning of this book in some areas means lots of kids are smuggling copies into their houses and reading it late at night.)

Because if nothing else, this one point about children being made into monsters by media and increasingly terrified police officers, victims tried in the court of public opinion is a strong and vital message. Any way we can get more people to understand it is fine by me. It's vital -- quite literally a life and death issue. The more we can show the humanity in all to those for whom city-dwelling brown people are foreign, the more we will hopefully - with work - change this issue. This is a welcoming story with likeable, sympathetic characters with whom people will easily empathize.

Her grandfather had disowned his son for marrying an opera singer and makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with Sophie, he will pay her tuition until she is of age and then he wants nothing to do with her. Sophie is glad to see him go and intends to excel just to spite him and formulates her Grand Plan. She meets her new roommates, Lady Georgiana and Miss Eliza Cross and for the first time in her short life, she has friends.

Twelve years later, Sophie Graham is now Mrs. Campbell, a young widow who gambles at the Vega club. Sophie has a plan  a Grand Plan, after she left school at 18, she became a companion to an elderly Lady Fox, Lady Fox left her a small sum when she passed and Sophie moved from Bath to London, on the way, she invented a past for herself, including a dead husband and she will use her skill at cards to win enough money to either marry or be financially independent. All is going according to plan until Lord Philip Lindeville starts to become a nuisance. He is a charming man but a reckless gambler  he definitely does not fit into Sophies plan, but she cant seem to shake him. She offers to play hazard with him, hoping to have him lose and leave her alone.

Jack Lindeville, Duke of Ware is at the Vega Club to settle his brothers debts, he is livid and tired of Philips careless and recklessness, but Philip has promised to change and stay away from the Vega Club for the next month to prove his intent to change. As Jack is walking out of the club, he spots Philip and sees red, he is gambling with a woman and when Jack sees her, he is immediately struck with the most intense desire he has ever felt. He goes to confront Philip and when the woman intervenes, Jack challenges her to an outrageous wager  5000 pounds if she wins and her promise to spend a week with Jack if she loses, Sophie is stunned and knows she should walk away, but as she has been winning and Jack has been losing, she takes the bet  and loses. Philip tries to save her, but Jack simply whisks her away.

Jack tells himself he only made the bet to keep Sophie away from Philip, but he doesnt deny his attraction to her. He takes a protesting Sophie to his country house, Alwyn House, Sophie tries to reason with Jack, she knows her reputation will be irrevocably damaged if she is gone for a week, she swears that she has no designs on Philip and promises to stay away from him if Jack will just take her home. Jack refuses. They go to Alwyn and ended up being trapped there for days because of the weather. At first Sophie is angry and lets Jack know it. For his part, Jack is trying to figure Sophie out, he wonders what her motivation is and if she is looking for a protector.

Once Sophie accepts that she is stuck in the country, she tries to make the best of it, Jack is nothing like what she expected based on Philips stories and she finds that she actually likes him and to her horror, desires him. They spend the next few days together getting to know each other and forming a friendship, but the desire is there, simmering like a covered pot. The night before they are to return to London, the pot overflows and they make love. Jack doesnt want to let her go, but she refuses to be his mistress and he cant ask her to marry him after only knowing her a few days. She makes him promise to stay away from her and forget they ever had an affair, he agrees. They part and both immediately miss each other. But Sophie cannot afford to engage in an affair, she has a PLAN and being a mistress, no matter how tempting, is not a part of the plan.

They have been apart for five days when Sophie goes to see Jack. Philip is being a problem and she asks Jack to talk to him. Jack is overjoyed to see her and promises to take care of Philip. She thanks him and they kiss, things become heated and would have gone farther if they had not been interrupted by a knock on the door. Sophie leaves and admits to herself that she doesnt want to be apart from him. Jack feels the same, but will honor his promise to her.

Later that night, they meet again at Vegas, he is shadowing Philip to keep him away from Sophie, but he all but ignores her. She is grateful, she told everyone that she had been ill and that is why she hadnt been at the club for a few days, she said that Jack didn't hold her to the wager and took her home. She knows now that marriage to another man is not an option, but she still has a reputation to uphold. When she is leaving, Jack is leaving too and lets her take the hackney, he says he will walk. She leaves and sees him walking, she has the driver stop and invites Jack to share the carriage. She then invites him in to her house. They embark on an affair. They both know they are falling in love, but neither is sure of the others feelings and events in their pasts make them wary. When Sophie tells Eliza what happened with Jack, Eliza urges her to tell him the truth about her past.

Jack has been toying with the idea of marriage to Sophie, he is ready to declare himself, when his mother drops a bombshell on him. He knows he loves Sophie, but he needs to sort out this problem before he asks for her hand. Sophie is resolved to tell Jack everything about her past, but is worried that she will lose him. That night when Jack arrives at her house, she tells him everything, including that she loves him. He tells her he doesnt care about her past, he loves her and wants to marry her.

It seems like smooth sailing to their happily ever after, but jealous brothers, interfering mothers, well-meaning friends, personal insecurities and doubts may end their HEA before it even begins.

I thought this was a wonderful story, full of emotion, secrets, incredibly likeable characters, steamy love scenes, quickly resolved problems and a truly beautiful HEA. I did knock off  a star because there is an event in Sophies past that I didn't feel the author fully explained and I wasn't super jazzed that they made no attempt prevent pregnancy during their affair, which considering how much Sophie valued her reputation, seemed out of character.

I would highly recommend this story and cant wait to read Eliza and Georgianas books!!

7341,613,1895,"What a fun book! These characters! Alyssa Cole's orphaned grad student and prince-in-disguise kept me up reading way too late last night and were my first thought when I awoke this morning. I dove back into the story before I even thought about breakfast - a rare occurrence, believe me. ;-)

I've been hearing about Cole for the past year but this was the first of her books that I've read. It definitely won't be the last. I loved the fun and flirty banter, the freshness of the story, the appeal of the characters, the exploration of friendship, the emotional growth of Naledi and Thabiso, and the twists that kept me wondering how everything would end.

7343,1136,282,"I loved this so much! Not only is just an adorable story with adorable romance but I loved every second of the anxiety in this book. It was great and I loved how everyone in her life understood and wanted to help. Most people with anxiety, including myself, have heard someone in their life say ""just don't worry about it"" and ignore anxiety as an actual disorder. It was great reading about family and friends that wanted to help instead of just telling her she worries too much. This was such a sweet story and I'm not shocked at all that I finished it in a day.",1519689600,5
7344,248,1896,"Stunning.  This relentlessly grim but beautifully written novel of the 1936 Tupelo tornado is about more than the aftermath of the storm- it's about two inextricably tied families, race, and class.  Dovey, the laundress is one terrific heroine but Jo, the privileged daughter with a horrible secret that links her to Dovey's granddaughter, is one as well.  Jo discovers just how irrelevant she is to her parents when the tornado hits, as her mother is worried only about her baby brother and her father, well, Mort is worried about something else.  Dovey knows where she fits in the world but she's determined to find her husband, grand daughter, and great grandson when the world blows apart. What she finds is Jo, who later finds a baby in the crepe myrtle and believes he's her brother.  The descriptions of the destruction (and the injuries) are detailed and horrifying- so much so that you will be able to picture them.  Gwin even includes animals, such as Snowball the cat (although we don't know what happened to Henry the guinea pig.) There are a lot of coincidences, which some might find troublesome but that's often how life works.  I read this in a long gulp, wanting very much to find out what happened to Virgil, Dreama, Jo, Tommy, and most of all Promise.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  This is wonderful historical fiction and while it is often distressing to read, it's well worth your time.",1519689600,5

Cassie Jensen is out walking her dog late at night when she is struck by a car. She lands in an intensive care unit under the watch of Nurse Alice. Also in the ward is a patient named Frank, locked into his body, unable to communicate that he can hear and see. And as family and friends stop by the ward to see Cassie, Alice gets the feeling that something just isn't quite right. And Frank? Oh, Frank knows something isn't right - but he has no way of telling anyone.

What a great premise! We learn more about what led to this moment from Cassie's memories. There are two other POVs - Alice and Frank's. Bit by bit, the story is pieced together. Those rotating POVs had me listening to just one more chapter late into the night, seeing if I could guess the final whodunit. And guess what? I didn't! I love not being able to guess the final reveal. Each chapter does add to the mystery plot, but also explores each character's personal life though a development in the present.

I chose to listen to If You Knew Her. The reader was Katey Stobey. I quite enjoyed her voice. It's pleasant to listen to, easy to understand and I thought she interpreted Elgar's work well. Her inflections and tones match the content and characters well. This was a fantastic debut and I can't wait to read what Elgar writes next!",1519689600,5
7346,1019,591,"I wanted SO BADLY to love this book! I have loved and/or wanted to see Haven and Sera's story since the first installment of Scandal and Scoundrel, but I can't in good conscious give this the five stars that I want to - or that pretty much every Sarah Maclean book should have. This book is hot, it has a lot of beauty, and the SISTERS ARE EVERYTHING - however, (and without giving away too much of the plot) it lacked resolution in regards to all the hurt and challenges that the couple had faced together and separately over the years. I also felt like the book was overreaching a little in regards to Sera's bid for independence. Such a big deal was made of it that it almost felt forced. Sera is a force of nature and that jumps off the page without very much effort needed.
That being said... darlings, for real... even an ""okay"" Sarah Maclean story is still above and beyond almost everything else in the genre.",1519689600,3

First let me talk about the things I didn't like. Honestly the only issue I had was the multiple pov. There were some chapters with the other characters that I enjoyed but over all they kind of bored me and I just kept wanting to get back to Mare. Besides that I didn't really have any other problems.

Now the rest. This book is heartbreaking. I don't want to spoil anything but it takes you on an emotional roller coaster that is insane. Also still struggling with whether I want to hate Maven or hold him close and tell him everything is okay. I just love how deep and crazy complicated his character is. You can't help but feel for him. Mare has so much development in this book. You see everything she goes through and how she handles it and I loved all of it. There is tons of action and lots of new characters that I can't wait to see more of in the next book. That ending though. Again I don't to spoil but I was holding back tears through that ending.

7348,613,1897,"This is the deeply romantic Lisa Kleypas storytelling that I fell in love with years ago. From beginning to end, it's my favorite book so far in The Ravenels series.

I wasn't sure what to expect of Garrett. In previous books we're shown a no-nonsense doctor who hasn't much of a life outside of her career but she really evolves in this book. I enjoyed watching her transition as she begins to embrace her emotional side without sacrificing any of the strength in her straight-forward, scientific, medical attributes. I liked her and was firmly in her corner, cheering her on. And Ethan. ::sigh:: What can I say? Ethan Ransom is one of my all-time favorite Kleypas heroes. I really fell for this guy. A self-made man, lethal government agent, with the soul of a poet, a well-hidden Irish accent that weakens the knees, a heart that beats solely for one unconventional woman, and knowledge of 120 pleasure positions? Yes, please!

For fans of the series, West Ravenel has a fair amount of page time in this book and it's only upped my anticipation for his story! I hope we'll be seeing more of Ethan and Garrett in future books as well. I haven't had nearly enough of them!",1519689600,5

7350,302,1898,"Summer Hours at the Robbers Library by Sue Halpern is a very highly recommended novel about second chances and family. It surprised me how much I loved this gracefully written contemporary, charming novel with its distinctive characters.

Kit is the reference librarian at the Carnegie Library (called the ""Robbers"" Library based on the name of a local tycoon, Robers, who promoted it) in Riverton, NH. Kit has moved here four years ago to escape her past and wants nothing more than a peaceful, quiet, secluded life that revolves around working at the library. She often thinks of her therapist, Dr. Bondi, and what he has said to her in the past and would currently say about situations.

Sunny (Solstice) is an fifteen-year-old who is arrested for shoplifting a dictionary. She is sentenced to community service at the library for the summer. Sunny is un-schooled and the only child of her living-off-the-grid hippy parents. Her community service at the library opens up a new world to her and she eagerly attaches herself to Kit.

Rusty is a former Wall Street investor who lost his job. He has come to Riverton looking for an old bank account that belonged to his mom and should be worth some money now. He is at the library everyday using the computer to do research.  Rusty eventually joins the group of four retired men who come to the library every morning to read the papers and drink coffee. He also begins to connect with Kit and Sunny.

These three unique individuals begin to form an uneasy friendship and connection as their stories are slowly told through alternating chapters. Kit's story is more complicated than the others and the larger backstory that begs to be told after the opening chapter. Sunny's story is based more on her parent's decisions and how they have impacted her life. Rusty is, obliviously, trying to find a new direction to his life after he lost his previous job.

Halpern has made all these characters appealing and compelling. I liked the narrative switching between the character's stories and found them equally compelling. I wanted to know what happened to them and see healing for them in the future. I loved the empathy given to the life of all these characters and the insight into their situations. I also loved the grace they gave each other, as they tried to understand and help each other. These are beautifully captured characters. (I saved quotes that I won't share due to spoilers, but there was so much insight and wisdom in them.)

The plot starts out at an even pace covering the background of the characters (but not Kit's entire story until later) before picking up the drama. The biggest complement I can give  is that I was looking forward to sitting down and reading it and felt happy and satisfied when the novel concluded. While there was drama and conflicts, in the end this novel that left me feeling happy that recovery from traumatic events can happen and family can be chosen. And I loved the sheer love of reading and books that permeates the novel, along with the line of poetry from a notable poet that opens each chapter.

7351,633,1897,"I received a copy of this title to read and review for Wicked Reads

5 Stars

Hello Stranger is the 4th installment of The Ravenels series, and can most certainly be read as a standalone. While I have read the majority of Lisa Kleypas's backlist, I had not read any of this series, and I had absolutely no difficulty falling into the story. I had no confusion reading this as a standalone, and look forward to going back to book 1 and working my way through the series.

Hello Stranger starts off with a thrilling scene, drawing the reader into the story from word-one in an innovated way. Our hero and heroine have had previous encounters. However, since this was the first I've read, I don't feel short-changed with how Kleypas released the previous information about their encounters without doing an info-dump.

Garrett Gibson is the first female doctor in England, in a time when women were not seen in the same light as men. She was logical, non-emotional, no-nonsense, but written in a manner that does not make her seem cold. I immediately identified with Garrett, which had me emotionally invested in the character and the journey. I appreciated that Hello Stranger didn't concentrate on balls and trapping a man in the marriage mart, befitting the characterization.

Ethan Ransom is an interesting character, with a mysterious backstory. He's as practical and efficient as the doctor but has a red-blooded, passionate streak. Trained to do the jobs in which most would not succeed, Ransom tries and fails to disconnect from his humanity.

Garrett and Ransom are drawn together, bringing out portions of human nature they both suppress due to their professions. Their romance felt real, with a slow-build, high tension, and sizzling passion unfolding organically throughout the story.

They're tested, both as a couple, but most certainly by profession, in a manner that allows the reader to see Garrett's medical knowledge. The reader can see that Garrett is not a damsel in distress throughout the majority of the book- not only will she protect herself, she is driven to care for others. The depth in which the author goes to show the medical limitations of the time, some readers may be drawn to skim this portion- however, I was intrigued by both the medical angle, as well as how women in Garrett's profession were treated.

There is a small side cast of characters, which I'm sure are past narrators. However, the reader gets to meet West, who most certainly will be the hero of the next installment. I enjoyed him immensely, and all the foreshadowing made me hungry from West's book.

My favorite part of the entire novel was the instant familial connection Ransom and West shared. Their interplay was amusing and heartwarming. It was as if West brought out another side to Ransom- a sarcastic and witty side that brought levity to an otherwise darker novel, and this transferred over into how they both interacted with Garrett.

Here are two quotes from the beginning of the novel that had me thoroughly entertained, and will also give a glimpse into Garrett's character.

You've been all work and no play for much too long. And then one night a mysterious and handsome man appears out of the shadows, fending off attackers on your behalf-""

""That part was annoying,"" Garrett interrupted. ""I was doing quite well at being my own hero until he jumped in.""

Helen's lips curved. ""Still... it must have been a little flattering.""

___

""This man is a patient,"" Garrett told the cookmaid, removing the posy of violets from the buttonhole of her walking jacket before handing the garment to her. ""I've brought him here for a consultation- please see that we're not disturbed.""

""Consultation for what?"" the maid asked slyly, her gaze traveling from Ethan's head to his toes, and back up again. ""'E don't look all that peaked to me.""

Garrett's brows lowered. ""You know better than to comment on a patient's appearance.""

Leaning toward her, the cookmaid said in a stage whisper, ""I meant to say I 'opes you can do something for this poor, sickly wreck of a man.""",1519689600,5
7352,278,1899,"""The Little Reese Ranch was ten miles from its nearest neighbor, thirty miles from a paved road, and sixty miles from the closest town, Tonopah.""

Oh, my heart is hurting. Willy Vlautin is such a gifted author. He pulls his readers into his books, letting (or making) them feel every emotion, good or bad.

Horace Hopper is 21 years old. He is part Paiute and part Irish and his feelings are as mixed up as his ancestry. His father deserted the family when Horace was very young. His mother dumped him off with his emotionally abusive grandmother when she remarried and had another baby.

Luckily for him, his grandmother seeks out some local Nevada sheep ranchers and Horace goes to live with them. Their grown daughters have left home and soon they look at Horace as the son they never had.

He's a hard worker and loves the ranch but feels driven to prove himself, shamed by the abandonment of his parents. So his dream is to become a professional boxer and he leaves the ranch to fulfill that dream.

Author Vlautin is SUCH a good writer. From the first page, from the first words on the page I knew this was a book that would impact me. His characters are so real, so vibrant, and I savored this book slowly.

The only other thing I've read by Vlautin is a short story in an anthology called THE HIGHWAY KIND. The story was called THE KILL SWITCH and after reading this book I remembered that I had bought a collection of four of his books and never read it. I'm off to remedy that now.

I received this book from Harper Perennial through Edelweiss in the hopes that I would read it and leave an unbiased review.",1519689600,5
7353,70,1893,"I love stories that have multiple points of view and this story has POVs from all the main characters. I felt that every character was developed and infused with such personality. They were all distinct and I loved getting to know each one. I know everyone was super excited that this story was being pitched as reminiscent of Anastasia in a space setting but that was not the draw for me. I liked the story of Anastasia, although it was never my favorite, BUT if I had to choose a favorite rendition then Heart of Iron would absolutely be it!

What drew me to this story initially was the cover. It is just so interesting to look at and it also reminds me of a tulip bud which is one of my favorite flowers. The writing style of this story was what made me love it though. I felt that all the relationships that were built were just heart-warming and that the entire plot with the metals, the hive, and the conspiracy was just so very cool! There were many twists that I was not expecting and a few events that took place really grabbed my heart. I wish the ending didn't turn out the way that it did but I guess that is also what will keep me hanging on for the sequel. That is a not so subtle request for a sequel by the way, lol.

If you are indeed a fan of the story of Anastasia then this book will be a welcomed addition to your library because I think it is the best Anastasia like story that I have read. So, what do I wish had been different or better? The story started out with Ana on a mission to save her friend Di and I wish that it had started out with the crew actually pirating and that I could have been a part of the bonding with the crew. I knew that the crew cared for each other but I would have enjoyed some pirating action. The story just felt as if it had already started and that I was coming in after an important plot point had already taken place. Besides that, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Heart of Iron and I highly recommend this book to fans of science fiction or space operas.

This review is based on a complimentary book I received from Edelweiss+. It is an honest and voluntary review. The complimentary receipt of it in no way affected my review or rating.",1519689600,4
7354,134,1893,"Stalo ban ach vanen. Stars are not afraid.

I have wanted to read this story since I heard it pitched as Anastasia in space, and while I definitely see some Anastasia elements, Heart of Iron truly shines in its characters and relationships. We follow Ana, a girl with no memory of her past, as she fights to save her Metal companion, Di from a broken memory core. Along the way, Anna meets new friends and uncovers secrets about her past that leads to revelations she would never have expects.

Things I Liked
I loved Ana and Dis relationship. I instantly felt their history and connection. They have a fun and vibrant friendship that feels real, but they also had some deeper emotional moments that drew me in as well. You can just tell that they really love each other.

I also really liked Jax and Robb. They  were beyond  ADORABLE together. They have some pretty instantaneous flirty when they meet and banter that was so fantastic to read.

I liked a lot of the worldbuilding elements in the story. I really learning about the Solani people, even if I feel like it took a little long to get the info. I liked learning about the Iron Kingdom and their customs - who rules, how their political system is setup. And I thought the use of Androids , or Metals, was interesting, especially with the looming HIVE threat.

There was a lot of diversity in the story, which is always fantastic. Theres  a gay couple( Jax and Robb), a lesbian couple (Captain Seige and her wife), and many people of color.

The chapters were so short and easy to read that I flew through this book!

Things I Didnt Like
While I really liked the 4 main characters who have POVs in this book - their personalities all felt pretty similar (apart from Di). Ana, Jax, and Robb all have a confidence and sarcasm that, while engaging, felt kinda the same.

Heart of Iron was a super quick, fun SciFi read, and I honestly think I would have liked it even more if it was a standalone. But I thoroughly enjoyed the many different character dynamics we see, and they really drew me in. Heart of Iron is a story of self discovery and fighting to create a better future.",1519689600,4
7355,382,1893,"Thrilled to say that I enjoyed this book a whole bunch. I was a little bit nervous about reading it, yet hoped that I would love it. And I'm so happy that I did. It's a strong four star for me, and for the most part I loved this one. Found the writing to be gorgeous. And I simply adored all of the characters. Eee. Feeling so happy.

Heart of Iron is a fantasy Anastasia retelling set in space. And I loved every moment of it. It's a bit different, a bit the same as the animated movie. Which is a big favorite of mine. So reading this story was all kinds of exciting. I loved how it was the same, yet different too. This book is long, yet not nearly long enough. Ack.

The book is told from many point of views, and while I usually do not enjoy too many people to read about, I did not mind at all in this book. There weren't too many, and I grew to love all of them and wanted to read more of everyone. The main characters are Ana, Di, Robb and Jax. I might have loved Ana and Di the very most, but gosh, did I love them all so much. And getting to know them was the very best. This book is about these characters and a few others being pirates and having their own spaceship. I adored reading about the other characters as well. The captain was all kinds of awesome and I just really liked getting to know them. They were a family, and I loved that. The one reminded me a lot about Cinder and Six of Crows, which was awesome.

I am not going to write too much about the plot of this book. Only a little bit. I think. I simply cannot stop thinking about it all. Mostly thinking about all the spoilery parts, lol. But all of it were awesome. This book takes place in space, and I loved learning about everything. I wish to know even more about this world, though. It was exciting. This book also focus a lot on royalty and others wanting to kill them and lots of family drama and I loved it all very much. Was interesting to read about, and exciting too. Plot was good.

I loved the most to read about Ana and Di. Ana does not know anything about her past, as she and Di were found in an escape pod some years back with no memories. Ana has made a life for herself among these outlaws, and I loved that very much. Di is not human. He is her very best friend, and also a Metal. Which is kind of like a robot. He has no emotions, but he thinks and talks for himself. Him and Ana are the best of friends and they do everything together. I loved that so much. But oh, my poor heart. Sniffs.

Because Ana is in love with Di. And Di does not have those kind of feelings, he cannot have them. And it broke my heart a little. But I also loved it so much, because Ana loving him made me so so happy. Their friendship was the best. And I can say that there is a twist coming up that can make their love possible. Eee. I shipped them so much. Di was all kinds of fun and adorable. And Ana was fierce and awesome. I loved getting to know them both so much. And want to read more about them more than anything. Ahh.

Then there were Robb and Jax. And oh, how I loved these two boys. Robb is almost a royal, and his family is a big deal. Though also all kinds of cruel, I think. Though Robb is not. He do make some bad choices at times, but gosh, I adored him. Loved getting to know this boy. And gosh, Jax was awesome. Different and sweet and full of magic, in a way. I loved that so. And I ship these two boys a whole bunch and their romance was the sweetest. And so very rude and I wish only the best for them together. Eee.

There is so much I could say about this book. And I have already written way too much. Simply couldn't help it. I adored Heart of Iron. Have not talked too much about the plot and such, and not going to either. You all need to read this book. Because it is awesome. Ana has a secret past. As does Di and just about everyone else too. And I very much enjoyed getting to know all of it. This book was an epic fantasy space novel. With such gorgeous characters. And such a rude story. Hmph. It was so good. I will not forget this.

I'm giving this book a strong four star rating. Not quite a five star, but also not far from it. Because I really did adore this book. And I loved reading it very much. There was not a single thing about this that I hated. And that makes me very happy. I only wish that there had been a bit more romance, that Ana and Di had spent more time together. I felt like they were apart for most of the book, which broke my heart a little. Aw. And that ending. I cannot with that ending. Perfect, but beyond rude. But yes. I adored this book so much.

After searching, I am unable to figure out if there is another book coming after this one. And not knowing this is ruining my heart. Because this cannot only be one book. And it cannot end like that. It simply can't. There are way too many open things going on. I cannot survive not knowing what happens next. Hmph. And so, please, let there be a sequel. At least one more book. But hoping for even more than one book. Eee. There might be one coming, and ahh, I am crossing my fingers. I need more of everything so badly.

Anyway, though. I am so thrilled that I read Heart of Iron. So excited to have the hardcover coming too, and owning this precious print ARC from a trade. Eee. I am going to need everything from this precious. Because Heart of Iron was all kinds of lovely. All the characters were stunning and diverse and the very best. The romance killed me with heartbreak and swoon. The story was exciting and rude. I need more about these characters and this world so badly. You all need to read this book too. It's very much worth it.

I liked the diverse cast of characters and the story had the potential to be great but it fell short of my expectations. It seemed as though the author had too many ideas she wanted to cram into one book, and because there were some many of them, none were actually well developed. I found characters one-dimensional and the romance between Ana and Di very awkward. The romance between Jax and Robb was a little better. The ending was interesting but the book did end on a cliffhanger and by the time the second book comes out I am not sure I will be interested in picking it up.
I wanted to love Heart of Iron because I enjoy sci-fi but this book left me unsatisfied.

""Today, the Grand Duchess would choose her heir--and the thirtieth Emperor of the Iron Kingdom. So naturally, with everyone distracted, it was a good day for a heist.""

I think I need to take a break from YA Sci-Fi for a bit. Heart of Iron felt like a loose combination of Zenith and Illuminae, (but replace the creepy zombie people with creepy red-eyed metals aka robots) and Star Wars. The main problem I had with this book was that I felt that there wasn't really anything new. Besides the religious system developed, everything else seemed too typical (and predictable) for this genre.

The story is told from multiple character point-of-views, shifting between the main protagonist Ana, to D09 (a robot), to Robb, Erik, and then Jax which makes it difficult to follow whos head we are in. All characters are from variable backgrounds when considering class, status, orientation, and race. Robb and Erik, both sons of the royal Ironblood family, stand at opposing ends from one-another. Tensions between their family, including their queen mother, are high. Ana, a girl-turned-thief that has no recollection of her past and is searching for a new core to fix her beloved glitching robot D09. Jax, a Solani pilot from an ancient race of beings has special abilities to predict others futures. Clearly, diversity is highly represented between the characters on multiple levels, which is refreshing. However, there is little distinction between the characters themselves when the point-of-view is shifted from one to another.

This section will contain SPOILERS.

There are a couple of aspects that I want to discuss that turned me away from this book. This does not go to say that another reader won't like this book. I just wanted to give a more concise depiction of why I DNFd this read.

#1 There is one particular romance that is budding from the beginning between Ann and D09. While some people may not mind the fact that a human is in love with a robot, thats fine. For myself, this is downright weird and something I don't care to read about.

#2 The fact that this is said to be an Anastasia retelling makes it perhaps too-revealing? In the first portion of the book, we learn that Ana has no recollection of her past. She was found in space in an escape pod with her robot. Then, there is talk of a missing female heir. So...if my conclusions are correctshes the one missing. This is speculation, as I didn't finish the read. However, all arrows seem to be pointing in that direction.

End of SPOILERS.

Overall, the plot is set up to be overly-predictable. Up until almost half-way through the read, I didn't feel any unique pull grounding me to the story, and I lost interest. I also didn't care for some of the connections being made between the characters, and decided overall that this isn't a read for me.

Vulgarity: I counted 45 words (including made-up cuss words) up until 40%.
Sexual content: Kissing only.
Violence: Moderate - there are several fighting scenes.

Since this is a DNF read, I will not be assigning a star-review.",1519689600,2

This book was just amazing. I am the BIGGEST Anastasia fan. I thought I could be Anastasia (which was never going to happen for a variety of reasons, but it was my dream). That being said, this was a wonderful, deeper, and updated version of the story we love. Not to mention, I kept hearing Anya's voice, so that was delightful. What picks you up, are the characters. They are so lifelike and just fascinating to behold. They immediately are endearing and make you care about the storyline. I am so excited for the sequel! It also has robots, which are the softest of all soft spots, and a m/m romance too - so that's just pie on pie.",1519689600,5

7360,566,1894,"Lady Olivia Howett wants to make everyone happy, she also hates injustice in any form, so she believes that she is the perfect woman to marry Lord Carson, the man her sister Eleanor was supposed to marry, and it doesn't hurt that Olivia is in love with Bennett, Lord Carson. Convinced that marrying him is the perfect solution, she gets him alone and proposes. When he tells her that he is not interested, she is angry and humiliated. He leaves and she is ready to indulge in a good cry when someone in the back of the room speaks up.

Edward Wolcott is the acknowledged bastard son of financier Mr. Beechcroft and best friend to Bennett. He was in the room avoiding the snide remarks about his birth and the not so discreet snubs. He overheard the entire interlude with Olivia and Bennett and offers her some advice, when she asks who he is, she ends up insulting him and he leaves.

Later they meet again when she is trying to find her sister, Bennett introduces them, Edward offers to help her find her sister and Olivia apologizes, she asks if everyone snubs him and is upset to learn that they do. She decides that she can help him (after all helping is what she does best), and then Bennett will see how wonderful she is and realize that he should marry her.

When Edward gets home that night, his father tells him that he is ill and only has months to live. He wants to see Edward settled and accepted before he dies and makes him promise to find a suitable wife. Edward agrees to try. The next day Bennett asks him to distract Lady Olivia and turn her interest elsewhere. Edward doesn't understand why Bennett is not as captivated by her as he is, but he agrees.

When Olivia sees Edward later, she launches her plan to help him. He confesses that he needs to find a bride and offers her a large donation to her favorite charity if she will help him.

Olivia dives into this project head first and make every effort to see Edward accepted. They spend time together and Olivia begins to doubt her feelings for Bennett, because she is attracted to Edward. Olivia loves spending time with Edward, for the first time in her life she is completely free to be herself and she likes it. She invites him and his father to dinner and hopes to further his social acceptance and find him a bride - a plan that isn't nearly as appealing as it started out being.

When her mother humiliates her at dinner and she runs out, Edward comes to comfort her and she kisses him. Later she tries to remind herself that it is Bennett she loves and she is trying to find a wife for Edward, not marry him herself. When Edward announces that he is returning to the country with his father and says that he will send her the donation, she kisses him - again. He kisses her back and then tells her this is goodbye. Olivia doesn't understand what she is feeling and she goes to see him and brings him a gift and collects the donation.

A week passes and Olivia admits that she misses him and that she is not in love with Bennett, but Edward is gone and she will most likely not see him again. She also begins to make some discoveries about herself. She is ashamed to realize that she doesn't really listen to people and always assumes that she knows what is best for everyone. She wants to change and becomes closer to her twin. When her mother tells her that Bennett has invited them to the country and is sure that he is going to propose, Olivia isn't sure how she feels or what she will do if Bennett does propose.

They arrive and learn that they are staying at Mr. Beechcroft's home and not Bennett's - Olivia is overjoyed to see Edward and when they are alone, sparks fly. Olivia returns to the others and finds her sister Pearl, she tells Pearl that she kissed him (again) and that she might love him. Pearl suggests she tell him how she feels. She makes a plan but is sidetracked when they visit the village, she saw some children and assumed they needed help and charged in to ""save"" them. Her efforts are not well received and she is humiliated. Edward comforts her as they walk back and tells her she needs to learn to ask if someone needs help, not just act like she knows what is best for everyone, she agrees. When rain threatens, they detour to a vacant shed and one thing leads to another - but before they go too far, she tells him they should marry and lists the reasons why it is a good idea. Edward takes offense and leaves her - he is incredibly sensitive about his birth and felt like she was taking pity on him. He loves her, but he can't be with her.

Olivia is bewildered and doesn't know what she did wrong, then realizes that while she listed all the benefits marriage would have for them both - she never told him how she feels about him. Her sisters urge her to speak to him and when they speak the misunderstanding is quickly resolved.

But Edward still has demons to conquer and Olivia has to stand up to her parents, who are ready to marry her off to Bennett.

This was an interesting story, not what I was expecting and not like any other Megan Frampton book I have ever read. The story moves at a quick pace and while there is definitely significant change in Olivia, I didn't really see the same change in Edward. I don't know exactly what I felt was missing from the story, but I didn't feel like it was everything it could have been. The writing is good, the love scenes steamy, the conflicts don't drag out and there is a very nice HEA. It is the second book in the series, but it can absolutely be read as a stand alone title.

7362,464,1894,"Follow your heart, or the body part that seems as though it is in the most need.
~ Lady Olivias Particular Guide to Being Reckless

Im not quite sure if its me, or if Ive just been drawn to a plethora of difficult characters to like of late  but Megan Frampton took the self-important, heedless and occasionally overbearing Olivia and used situations and one perfectly wonderful man in Edward to bring her some self-awareness, growth and, above all, some truly amusing circumstances in which she learned these lessons.  For Olivia was too much  too determined to see every injustice and rush in to quell it without actually considering the problems in a way that was deeper than her initial impression. And then, she was so busy being righteous and enlightened (and she was far more aware of the inequities in financial and social situations than her peers), that she never actually doubted her rightness in making a stand, or in fact, her rightness about her decisions about other peoples feelings.  So much in her own belief in her way being right, and others requiring her guidance that she is spectacularly set back in her quest to move forward in proposing to a man, who truly isn't at all interested.

And then we have Edward: born on the wrong side of the blanket yet afforded the education and money of others in the upper classes with one huge difference: his father rescued him from placement in an orphanage, claimed him and provided him with love and support that many Lords and Ladies should admire.  Having his best friend be a Lord and the object of Olivias apparent affection, Edward is thrown by the insistent curiosity he has for her. Of course, his friend is determined that an accident of birth should not influence Edwards reception in society or search for a wife: and with Edwards father receiving some troubling news about his health, Edwards  talked into a promise to find a wife in short order.  Enter Bennet and his challenge to Olivia: her determination to suss out and eliminate all injustices make her the perfect person to see Edward accepted into society and help him to find a match.

Say what you mean. Unless what you mean will upend your entire life. In which case, you should probably shout.
~ Lady Olivas Particular Guide to Being Reckless

Olivia had me laughing out loud in places and cringing in others- while Edward missed no social graces in appearing as a gentleman, and perhaps is all the more intriguing for his heart and understanding of the world around him  good, bad and pretentions alike. While it was obvious to everyone (but Olivias parents and she herself) that she and Bennett were too alike in their determination to make a difference with little else to build a relationship upon, it is her twin Pearl who instantly sees the potential for love to bloom between Olivia and Edward: a notion that Bennett himself had and used that thought to thrust them together.  And Oliva is blissfully unprepared for overthinking her own heart until the situation is so in her face that she cant figure it out.  Fortunately for her, she does have her twin Pearl to discuss things with  and help her to sort things out. Of course, nothing is as simple as them being compatible and Edwards obvious enjoyment of her bossiness, but the ride to the end  full of missteps, laughs and some clothes-destroying kittens is a delightful one.  Sure to please fans of the series and these sisters who, despite their parents and societys desires for proper tend to fall out of the norm quite frequently.

7363,550,1894,"Megan Frampton won me over when I read Why Do Dukes Fall in Love? and since then I have only good things to say about her and her books. The best part of the book was the kittens and that is not a bad thing. I just loved them. Edward's father is also a good element in the book because he did everything he could to provide for his son and he was a good father. Olivia, the lady in question is reckless and a little ahead of her time. She proposed twice during the events of this book to two gentlemen, which was weird and for me 50 years too early. She is not the easiest character to like and she is either a hit or miss. I do hope you will like her. Edward might be a child born out of wedlock, but he is a good person and one of my liking. He has some issues with his legitimacy as it was to be expected. He was a flawed character, but in a way that made him more relatable than anything else.

I know I devoured the book since it took me a short amount of time to finish it for a 384-page book. I wanted to see how Olivia and Edward would manage to fall in love and get what they wanted. I was happy with the final result. I hope to see Bennett's book sometime soon. Maybe he will marry Pearl or something.

7364,1136,2,So I love Amy Poehler and like everyone else saw this book everywhere in the book community. I finally decided to read it and it took me two weeks. NOT because I didn't like it but because I was moving and had no time to read. But I did enjoy this. It was a great insight into her life and had some laugh out loud moments. I was a little bored sometimes but still thought it was a fun interesting read.,1519689600,4
7365,407,1893,"Seven years ago, Ana was found by the dread pirate Captain Siege floating adrift in an escape pod. She has no recollection of why she was there or where she came from, only that she was accompanied by her Metal, D09, who protected her. Now, her stalwart friend is glitching and Ana will do anything in her power to save him.

Once they begin on this quest, however, nothing will ever be the same as they uncover a decades-old plot against the Emperor that led to a rebellion seven years ago and the Iron Kingdoms Princess, the one foretold who would save the Kingdom from the Great Darkness being declared dead [you can probably guess where this is going]. With the Kingdom under threat once again, Ana will have to decide where her heart truly belongs.

For those of you who, like me, may overlook this tidbit: Heart of Iron is a retelling loosely based on the story of Anastasia. It didn't take me too long to make the connection on my own, however, and once I did the plotline was almost too glaringly obvious. Not in a bad way mind you. For every moment that Heart of Iron drifted too far into predictable territory, Ashley Poston would whip out an equal amount of moments where the twists and turns were lovely and surprising, keeping me on the edge of my seat in certain places.

The story hits the ground running and rarely stops to rest. For the most part this is to the storys advantage. Theres not a lot of clutter. Every word, every description and piece of dialogue was important. There are things we know and expect to happen, but where the book really excels is figuring out the mystery of what happened to Ana those seven years ago. The piecing together of her lost memories will shape the direction of where the series goes from here I believe.

The book alternates in short chapters between the points of view of our four main characters: Ana, D09 Di, pilot Jax, and Ironblood Robb, and these relationships are the most important. Ana and Dis stands out because Di, being a Metal, shouldnt adhere to what could be considered normal human emotions. Yet he invariably feels a connection to Ana thats more than simply programming, even if he cant put a word to those feelings, and Ana feels the same. Its sweet and heartbreaking, and its the relationship that the book revolves around.

Probably my favorite is the opposites attracting pairing of Jax and Robb. I say opposites attract because at the base level thats how it appears, but when you start to peel back the layers you find that these two characters are so suited. They both have to deal with the constraints put upon them by their families. While Jax has already broken away, Robb is just starting to understand that he doesnt have to live by what his family wants, and maybe both can defy whats written in the stars.

The only drawback I found was the very thing that moves the story forward: the quick revolving chapters. Unfortunately, while I loved the pacing it set, I felt like it also kept me from fully feeling the weight of the characters relationships with one another. As a reader, I wanted to have all the feels too, and it was just a smidgeon off the mark for me.

The setup of this story is spot on, however, and Im hoping as the series goes my feelings will change. On its own, Heart of Iron is an interesting retelling, but really its such a fantastic sci-fi adventure. Perfect for fans of Merissa Meyers Cinder.",1519689600,4
7366,376,1900,"In WHERE I LIVE, Brenda Rufener explores homelessness in a uniquely wrenching way, one that forced me to confront my own privilege. Poverty is a topic still so rarely explored in YA. Most protagonists are upper-middle-class, and money only becomes an issue when it's time for college. The daily life of someone with so little -- that's what we see here, and it's so needed. The struggle to eat, to bathe, to find a place to sleep.

The matter-of-fact way Linden, who secretly lives in her high school, approaches her living situation makes it easy to root for her. While at the beginning we're not sure how she became homeless, Rufener skillfully scatters hints like breadcrumbs. When all the pieces come together at the end, it's both satisfying and horrifying, and likely true to life for too many teens.

And oh, Linden's friend group -- their relationship is so lovely. I've never read a YA quite like this, and that's part of what makes WHERE I LIVE such an important book. It's about homelessness and poverty as much as it is about finding your people, finding your voice, and telling your story. It could have so easily turned preachy, but Rufener's sharp writing and fresh characters keep it authentic and true. I highly recommend it!",1519689600,5
7367,565,1892,"Review I LOVED, LOVED this new series by Caroline Linden!

I adored Sophie Campbell, shes such a spirited young woman, she new that she only had herself to depend upon, especially after the way her grandfather treated her. Loved the way she defied convention and was mistress of her own destiny, that is until she gambled everything and lost! And she lost, she lost big (namely her heart) to the Duke of Ware.
Jack Lindeville was everything his younger brother wasnt, he wasn't reckless, never gambled and he never created a scandal, but as soon as he met Sophie he became reckless, gambled and created a scandal of EPIC proportions!
Oh how I love Jack, I saw a man that wanted to be loved, a man that wanted to be needed a man who just WANTED! I so enjoyed reading this wonderful, wonderful story of emotions, two hearts that became one, their need for each other so great that even though they had an agreement they chucked it out the window, though they had a misunderstanding to overcome, everything works out nicely and Sophie gets an unexpected surprise visit that helps her situation.

7368,120,998,"Space opera. The term conjures up visions of intergalactic battles, ugly alien monsters, and heroic human commanders besting all against impossible odds. Back in the 1930s, science fiction was dominated by such sophomoric fare, and the genre has appeared periodically ever since. Notable latter-day examples include Lois McMaster Bujold's long-running Vorkosigan Saga and John Scalzi's Old Man's War series. Both series have been bestsellers in recent years, and Bujold has won five Hugo Awards for hers.

In the early days of the genre, the typical space opera was characterized by one-dimensional characters, awkward dialogue, and lengthy scene-setting digressions. But today's writers do a much better job. Now a young American author,Becky Chambers, has come onto the scene with the first two novels in a new space opera series, with a third on the way later this year. The series debuted withThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet,a delightful departure from all the badhabits exhibited in the genre's infancy. (She was able to finish writing the book only by raising the necessary money from 83 generous souls on Kickstarter.) Chambers' characters are beautifully complex, the dialogue often sings, and her detailed and fascinating future universe emerges seamlessly from the story.

A 23-year-old woman is fleeing her life on Mars under the assumed nameRosemary Harper. To get as far as possible away from the people there who blame her for something terrible she had nothing to do with, she secures a job as a clerk on a ship that cruises through the galaxy ""punching"" wormholes into space. The Wayfarer is a second-class ship with a typical multispecies crew. It's ""the ugliest ship she'd ever seen."" Chambers notes, ""Building wormholes was not a glamorous profession. The interspatial passageways that ran throughout the Galactic Commons were so ordinary as to be taken for granted.""

Captain Ashby Santoso; the ""algaeist"" who tends the fuel tanks and hates everybody; and the two techs, Kizzy and Jenks, are all human. The pilot, Sissix, is an Aandrisk. She resembles a lizard (but don't ever call her that!) Ohan, the navigator, is a Sianat Pair who inhabit a single body but are referred to as ""they"" and ""them."" Dr. Chef is a six-limbed Grum whose handfeet show great skill both in the medical lab and in the kitchen. And then there is Lovelace, known as Lovey, the AI who serves as the ship's eyes and ears, its memory, and its internal communications. They're all sapientsin the terminology of the time.

With this motley cast of characters, you might expect a lifeless and tedious adventure tale along the lines of a 1960s production ofStar Trek. But no. This is a 21st-century version of space opera. Kizzy and Jenks (female and male) are best buddies and inseparable. However, Jenks is in love with Lovey, and the feeling is mutual. (Yes, Lovey is the artificial intelligence embedded in the ship.) We wonder about Rosemary, but not for long. She clearly has eyes for Sissix, the pilot. (They're both female.) The captain is involved in a long-distance love affair with a silvery sapient named Pei who represents the most beautiful species in the galaxy. They're male and female, the only traditional coupling in the story. Somehow, Chambers makes all these relationships believable. And, as Ann Leckie said about this book in a cover blurb, it's ""great fun.""

The greatest strength of this novel lies in character development. But the scene Chambers sets and the plot she spins out are both outstanding. I can't wait to read the two sequels.",1519689600,5

7370,302,1901,"I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer by Michelle McNamara is a very highly recommended true crime account of the serial rapist and killer who was responsible for fifty sexual assaults and at least ten murders in California during the 1970s and '80s.

Michelle McNamara was a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com. She started writing about the predator she called ""The Golden State Killer"" in 2011. At that time DNA testing had already linked the cases to one unknown man. The man began as a serial rapist in the 1970s before changing his M.O. and began murdering couples. McNamara was determined to sift through the thousands of pieces of evidence from over fifty-five crime scenes to try and unmask the identity of the violent psychopath. She poured over reports interviewed victims, and actively immersed herself in the online community of true crime enthusiasts.

I'll Be Gone in the Dark offers insights into the assaults and the alarming steps the killer took in selecting his victims and raping them in their homes in Northern California. She also points out the trigger in 1979 that caused him to move his territory to the south where he escalated to attacking and killing couples. It is also a picture of the time in which the crimes were committed, which in some ways abetted his ability to elude capture by multiple police forces. With all the current ability to cross reference details, check DNA, and work simultaneously with multiple agencies and people, this psychopath may finally be caught.

Alongside the discovery of new information (or connecting the dots of existing information) about the cold cases, McNamara includes personal autobiographical information about her life. It brings a humanity to the reporting and the facts of the cases. We can see how diligently she was working through the police reports, trying to puzzle-out the killer's identity. We know she often worked late at night, while her family slept.

Tragically, Michelle McNamara passed away in her sleep at age forty-six before she could put the finishing details on the book, but the masterful work was brought to completion by her editor, a colleague, and her lead researcher. The sections that McNamara was working on are extremely well-written and highlight her daily life alongside her research and obsession with the details of the crimes and her empathy for the victims and their families. While the flow of her investigation isn't completely seamless, the sections McNamara wrote are full of compassion and a resolve to discover the truth. Hopefully the evidence she has gathered will help uncover the identity of the killer.

7372,111,1892,"When twelve-year old Sophie Graham was orphaned, her grandfather Viscount Makepeace unceremoniously shipped her off to school, and at eighteen she was on her own. At twenty four, now Sophie Campbell, she is a professional card player, halfway to the ten thousand pounds she needs to be independent, and hopefully marry a nice man. Jack Linderville, Duke of Ware, is at Vegas to pay his brother Philips debts, again. It happens that the beautiful woman Jack has been ogling is partly responsible for Philips debts, and Jack is immediately smitten with Sophie; he is fixated on her bosom, he wants her. So Jack, who doesnt gamble anymore, proposes a wager: five thousand pounds if she wins, if she loses, Sophie has to spend a whole week with Jack.

MY ONCE AND FUTURE DUKE started off so well; the prologue is enchanting, and I loved Sophie until she behaved stupidly. Shes a professional gambler, she has been successful for years; Jack had lost all their games until his scandalous offer. I ask you, what are the odds that he would lose again? That Sophie accepts went against everything I had been told about her: the logical woman suddenly became entirely irrational, greedy, and risked her reputation; the Sophie I had encountered before would not have behaved so foolishly. This was not going to go well. I disliked Jacks attitude: hes arrogant, and basically buying her, although mentally he is not. He is teaching his brother a lesson  Okay, then. And I hated Jack. Sophie accepts the wager, and when she loses, she has the nerve to be offended! I mean, woman, acknowledge your loss and your idiocy, and be done with it; she had basically agreed to prostitute herself for a week, at least thats the way I would have seen it. But Jack is so handsome. Hmmm. I thought they deserved each other and that was the purpose of the exercise, wasn't it?

The forced proximity situation had to be reinforced in another way to make matters more palatable, I suppose. Jack and Sophie talk and get to know each other, which was lovely and charming, and I don't think it was deliberate from the author, but Sophie came off a little bit like a fortune hunter because of how she gushed over Jacks country home. So, they talk and chat, but God forbid they should tell each other everything, or ask the questions that beg asking, to avoid misunderstandings later on. Had I been able to forget Sophie behaving so out of character at the beginning, the romance might have worked for me, but I simply could not. Especially when Sophie agrees to something later on that irked me and went against her lifelong ambition. Instead of the sordid wager, Sophie and Jack could have been made to work together to stop Philips gambling; my problem was that Sophie acted in greed, and not like the professional she had been, and it all felt it was only for storyline purposes.

I really liked Philip, as a character in spite of his many shortcomings; he was foolish but interesting. And the poor Mr. Carter. Then there was the whole Lucinda episode that was entirely superfluous and needlessly upsetting, and one of Sophies school friends, Elizas escapades, which I suspect is to set up the next book in the series. I also hope in the final edition vingt-un will have been corrected to vingt-et-un; I cant recall having seen that mistake before.

If you like your Regency romance with steamy sex and you have no problem with the premise, you will love MY ONCE AND FUTURE DUKE, because the writing is gorgeous, the descriptions visions of loveliness, and the dialogues inspired.

I do not use the word ""masterpiece"" loosely when describing literary works, but I can say, without any reservation that ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is a literary masterpiece. If ""honesty"" is the true ingredient, the one essential mix, that is the foundation for any piece of literature to be considered great, well, then Mr. Remarque's novel about World War 1 meets and surpasses that test like very few novels have ever done.

Only a person who has lived through the nightmare of World War 1, could have written such an amazing and uncompromising novel about the horrors of that war. The enemy in this novel is WAR itself. Humanity, the earth with its streams and gardens, animals, and innocence are the real victims of war. Mr Remarque served during World War 1 and was wounded five times.

I decided to re-read this book, after nearly forty years, because I read a review by a young lady, Maureen""about the book in which she sums up her review with these beautiful words of poetry which she wrote in relation to this marvelous piece of literature. She wrote:

Bright red poppies in bloodied fields
Where death stalked its victims.
It cared not for age, creed, or nationality

What would they have achieved in life,
These young men, with so much yet to experience,
So many dreams to fulfil
If duty hadn't called, and they hadn't answered

When the sun set for one final time
It set on the lives they never lived

7378,184,765,"The Round House is one of Louise Erdrichs novels about the modern life of Native Americans. In this story the focus is on Joe, (Antone Bazil Counts), a 13-year-old Chippewa and his family, Bazil, his father and Geraldine, his mother. Other characters that figure in the story are his aunts and uncles, Clemence and Edward, and Sonja and Whitney, his grandfather Mooshum, his friends Cappy, Zack and Angus, Malya, a young unmarried woman with a child, and finally Linda Wishkob and her brother Linden Lark who are white. The plot focuses on the rape and brutal assault of Geraldine. Lark is identified as the perpetrator but as a white man he is finally set free and Joe decides to take justice into his own hands.

The story is moving and shows the emotional pain rape victims suffer. It also reveals a lot of life for modern Native Americans and the bigotry they still face and the friendships that develop, especially among the teen-age boys. It is well worth reading.",1519689600,4
7379,68,1836,"3 1/2!  I did have high hopes for this book.  It is a story about the government-made city in Tennnesee that was tasked with working on the top secet atomic bomb during WWII.  Because it was wartime, the majority of the workers that worked the machines were women. This story tells about their social, work and private lives during the two years or so that they worked in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  I found the book subject interesting, and the descriptions of their lives, social lives and personnel lives rather enjoyable while they lived and worked in this man-made city.  What I was disappointed with was the writing skills of the author.  I found the writing quite simplistic, and I didn't think the characters were developed fully enough.  I did find though that Janet Beard did shed some illuminating light on this top-secret and disturbing piece of American history.",1519776000,3

Most of you know Im an avid crime fiction reader, its my go to genre so Im slightly ashamed to say this was my first Laura Lippman book! Looking through her back catalogue I can see she writes exactly the kind of books I love so I have NO idea how shes been off my radar thus far. Ive seen many others say that Sunburn is not typical for her, but I loved it and her writing is so nuanced, so dang good that I won't be missing out on her books in the future.

Polly is a mysterious woman with a plethora of secrets in her past, you know little about her for a long time, Lippman methodically peels back the layers of her character until you get to the core. Adam also has a mysterious past and the same goes for him, you slowly but surely gain information about his history and you're just never totally comfortable trusting either of them. Unreliability at its best! There are quite a few points of view, but not too many in my opinion, each served a particular purpose and were there for a specific reason, not just as filler. The characters were complex, interesting and so shady, right up my alley.

Many will say this is a slow burn and I totally agree, but its also a slow unraveling of a tangled tale that I was never quite sure of. Not sure of who to trust, not sure what their true motivations were and definitely not sure of what would happen next. I never did figure things out ahead of time, the ending totally surprised me, completely unexpected and wholly satisfying.

>>>>>My Synopsis (Review follows): <<<<<
He was a duke attempting to stop his brother from gambling away the family fortune.
She was a young woman trying to make a living using her sharp mind and knowledge of cards.
He was the serious type, said to be dull and boring with his nose always in a ledger.
She was stubborn and would never apologize for trying to make it on her own. She even traded in her 'Miss' for a 'Mrs' to make it all seem more acceptable.
The two had nothing in common, but one night, one bet would change everything...

""I stake five thousand pounds."" Sophie's mouth dropped open and the crowd buzzed with shock--and delight.(...) ""One round each, played until loss...""(...)

The Duke's luck had been abominable, but that didn't mean her odds had improved. ""Not tonight, sir,"" she said, with more than a tinge of regret. Better to keep the few hundred pounds she'd already won.

""You mistake me. You don't have to risk a farthing.""(...) ""One week of your company is what I want.""

>>>>>My Review: <<<<<
Don't you love it when a book lives up to its insanely gorgeous cover? Well, I'm happy to say 'My Once and Future Duke' does just that. This is looking to be one heck of a good series.

Sophie Graham makes her living by playing cards. She never cheats, loses graciously, and bets according to the odds. She always keeps in mind the number one rule of gaming--Easily won, easily lost and makes a special effort not to be the one responsible for another's ruin.

Sophie was orphaned by twelve and then thrown into finishing school by her grandfather. Upon her eighteenth birthday he cut off all funds and ties with her. While she could have taken up a position at her school, Sophie decided to take a gamble and play the odds--quite literally. Her plan is to make ten thousand pounds, thereby, guaranteeing her independence. That would be enough for her to live on. Of course, if an eligible suitor presented himself, she would be open to that as well.

Vega club has since become her second home. They allow women to gamble and are rumored to have two simple rules--Pay your debts and hold your tongue. Unfortunately, with the bet Jack makes, the latter will not be upheld for the gossip is just too juicy.

Jack Lindeville, the Duke of Ware, is nothing like Sophie pictured. His brother Phillip had painted such a dreary picture of the man that she'd thought he'd be older and unattractive. What she finds is a man who is tall, golden-haired, with a face that might have been carved by Michelangelo, himself, so beautiful it was. Perhaps that is what spurs Sophie to throw caution to the wind with this man and accept his improper bet. That and the hope she'll win the five thousand pounds he wagered. It would be a substantial addition to her ever growing nest egg.

Jack has always been a paragon of virtue. He's concentrated most of his time and efforts into running the family estate and the land surrounding it. Making the outrageous bet is not like him, but there is something about Sophie that makes him forget himself. The attraction is mutual.

The song that played in my head while I was reading this one was Kenny Rogers' ""The Gambler""...

'You got to know when to hold 'em,
Know when to fold 'em,
Know when to walk away,
And know when to run.
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealing's done.'

Overall, I gave this one 4 1/2 out of 5 roses. This was one steamy, sexy, and fun read. While I loved the story, things got a little complicated with Jack's brother, Phillip. Then I wasn't too happy with Jack for a short time upon his and Sophie's returned to society after he absconded her to the family's country estate. Luckily, things were ironed out with Phillip, and Jack quickly redeemed himself in my eyes. On the Lisarenee Romance Rating Scale, this one earned a STEAM rating--too hot for a fan, but you still have a handle on things. You should use extreme caution when reading a book with this rating in public. People may inquire as to why you looked flustered and flushed. A most enjoyable read.",1519776000,4
7383,742,930,"Munich. The name of the Bavarian city of beer,pretzels and National Socialism reverberates down the dark corridors of the twentieth century. It was  the Munich conference in September, 1938 that serves as the background to this exciting book of historical fiction by famed British author Robert Harris. This was the conference at which Adolf Hitler, bellicose and one of the most evil leaders in human history, saw that his territorial ambitions in Eastern Europe could not be halted by the democracies of Great Britain and France. All of the principal players in this drama appear:
Hitler, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain and E. Daladier of France. Mussolini was also present from Italy to support his fascists ally Germany. The story involves two junior diplomats. Paul von Hartmann a staff member working for the German Foreign Office who is covertly involved in the plot to overthrow Hitler and Hugh Legett. The two young career men have not seen each other for six years but fondly remember their friendship at Oxford, The novel tells the history of the Munich Conference with solid research as well as the author's skillful telling of the fictional tale of Legett and von Hartmann.  Robert Harris knows how to spin a good spy yarn!
  This is a fairly short novel which is a page turner. If you want to learn your history in a  painless manner this is a good book to read! I recommend it highly to fans of historical fiction!",1519776000,4
7384,1088,819,"For the past couple weeks I have been on this Adult Thriller binge and have started listening/requesting all the things. And when this one started getting hot in the blogosphere, I knew I had to request this one too.
  Anna Fox does not come out of her house. She spends her time drinking wine, watching old movies, and talking to her husband and child. She has another hobby that one day gets her into a bit of trouble.... Spying on her neighbors. One night while Anna is spying on her new neighbors, she sees something that turns her entire world upside down. What is real and what isn't? And how does she know what isn't?
  I really enjoyed the concept of this book. Granted I don't want to find out about my neighbors spying on me, but I really loved finding out about Anna and how she accidentally sees what she sees. I really liked the way the mystery is played out as well. For the life of me I could not figure out who that person was until the very minute Anna did too!
  However, I am so over this idea in adult thrillers that the only way to make the narrator unreliable is to make sure they are an alcoholic or super high on some kind of meds. The Woman in Cabin 10, Girl on the Train, and this one are only a few of the thrillers I've read, and they all start out the same. Makes me not want to read them anymore. (I think I DNF'ed The Woman in Cabin 10 for this exact reason smh) Can we PLEASE find some other way to make the narrator unreliable? (Also if you read adult thrillers and know of some where the narrator is found to be unreliable but in ways other than being drunk or high, please send them to me!)
  As for the mystery, I thought it was pretty solid. Although I figured out who the culprit was super early on, (probably on 6 out of 11 discs) I wasn't exactly sure what had happened or how they had done it. It seemed a bit predictable, but then once you get comfortable and think you know everything, YOU DON'T.
  I decided to review this one here because there is a teen in this book. There is a lot of interaction with him as well so I can see this being a good crossover book for older teens interested in this type of thing. (I say this because I would have more than likely read this when I was a teen, but keep in mind I didn't discover YA until I was in college with Twilight.)
  The writing style itself was good, but nothing to write home about. It was easy to follow and definitely made me question and doubt my theories all the time. It also starts off pretty slow, but when things get going, they don't slow down.
  Although there were some things I did not care for, there were also some pretty great things about this too. It always gave me a really exciting drive to and from work and at one point made me happy to sit in the car for an extra 5 minutes to finish that part of the book. I can't wait to see what Finn does next!",1519776000,3
7385,727,1711,"Every now and then a book comes along that is just so purely delightful that you can't help but grin while you read it. Anna Meriano's debut novel, A DASH OF TROUBLE, is 100% one of those books. Leo and her large, loving, wonderful family are characters that I already miss, and who I can't wait to meet again in the next book in the series. At times funny (I laughed out loud a TON as I read), at times heartstring-tugging, and at times tender, the voice and the plot in this book perfectly capture what it feels like to be in that awkward time between childhood and teenagerhood, desperately wanting to be treated like a grown-up when everyone around you seems bent on continuing to see you as a little kid.

If you're a fan of Stephanie Burgis's KAT, INCORRIGIBLE series, you absolutely must not miss Anna Meriano's A DASH OF TROUBLE. I can't wait to see what comes next in the LOVE SUGAR MAGIC series!!!

7386,739,984,"I have been waiting to read this book for almost a year and maybe all my expectations killed it for me, but it wasn't as awesome as I was expecting. Maybe too much hype? The premise sure looks very enticing and the whole ordeal sounds like an almost sure movie adaptation will come ( it would be a smash it I say).

- It drags, a lot, during mostly 70% of the book, but the world building and the perspectives will be important I can foretell.
- I feel there were a lot of important characters. Sometimes it felt too much. It also helped with the slowness I guess.

7388,852,1895,"A Princess in Theory by Alyssa Cole is the first story in her Reluctant Royals series. It's a sexy contemporary romance about a hard working scientist heroine and a prince looking for his dream girl.

When Naledi Smith's inbox keeps getting emails from an 'African Prince looking for his long lost bride' she does what any forward thinking woman does  sends them to the recycle bin. She's a full time graduate student in epidemiology, working two jobs as a lab assistant and a waitress and she has no time for fairy tales. A child of the foster system, she's learned to rely on herself and doesn't hold out for any kind of prince charming.

Prince Thabiso of Thesolo has been looking for his childhood betrothed for years. When she's tracked down in New York, an innocent mixup has her believing he's the new hire at the restaurant, a comedy of errors that ends with him being fired. But now that he's found her, he's not going to give up so easily He arranges to stay in an apartment in her building, a 'coincidence' Naledi finds somewhat suspicious but takes in good faith and they develop a friendship with an undercurrent of desire that leads to some steamy nights together. But when Naledi finds out the truth about Thabiso will their fledgling romance end in a not so happy ever after?

What a delightful romance! I enjoyed everything about this story, starting with the emails Naledi receives that set the stage to the development of the romance between Naledi and Thabiso that goes through its fair share of ups and downs as they learn more about each other. Thabiso's secret is revealed part way through the story, when Naledi has already come to care about him and it puts their relationship back a notch until he can prove that he is trustworthy and truly apologetic for his deception.

The scientific aspects of Naledi's character are well done and delve into the difficulties females encounter in STEM studies (I know, because I'm a scientist myself), but also the extra challenges of being African American and having to work that much harder to gain recognition. Naledi has the added stress of being a foster child whose parents died in a car accident when she was quite young and having no family to take her in. She doesn't know that her parents were friends with the ruling family of Thesolo or why they fled the country. When Thabiso enters her life and she finds out the truth, it literally opens up a whole new world for her. Part of the story is set in Thesolo, and there is some excellent worldbuilding in this fictional African country with its own set of cultures and traditions.

Thabiso has the weight of a country on his shoulders and this forms many of his actions. Doing what's right for his people is a challenge when he's up against those willing to do anything for money and power and part of this story delves into the politics of Thesolo and the expectations of his royal parents. Falling in love with Naledi certainly complicates things when she doesn't turn out to be biddable bride material but rather a self sufficient, intelligent, and forthright woman who pulls no punches.

Naledi has a best friend, Portia, who tests the boundaries of that friendship on a continual basis, with a penchant for drinking too much and making poor decisions. They have their own share of ups and downs in this story, and I enjoyed reading about this female friendship. I'm especially looking forward to the next in the series, where Portia will get a chance to find her own happy ending.

The attraction between Naledi and Thabiso starts from their first meeting and leads to some steamy scenes between them. There's clear consent asked and given and with this author, consent is sexy! A Princess in Theory has a fun and modern premise, captivating and realistic characters with all too human flaws, features an interesting and unique African country and layers it all in a sexy and unique contemporary romance.",1519776000,5

At a young age Garrett Gibson fell in love with science and decided to become a doctor. She believes there will always be people who will say your dreams are impossible, but they can't stop you unless you agree with them. When she was barred from studying in England, she studied abroad. She got her degree and went back to London and began practicing there. The only thing she thought she might never be able to have is a family of her very own. She believed no man would ever let her do what she does. When she meets the mysterious Ethan Ransom, however, she thinks maybe, just maybe, she was wrong...

Ethan Ransom has been fascinated with Garrett since the first time he met her. She's like no one else he's ever met. He's never really thought about marriage, but as he gets to know her there's something about her that keeps drawing him back. He has done things in his life that he's not proud of, but somehow he thinks Garrett may be the one person to accept him as he is--faults and all.

>>>>>My Review:<<<<<
I will confess to being a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas. Of all the novels she writes I feel her historical romances are the most magical. My favorite types of historical romances delve into what life was really like for woman in historical times, and then creates a heroine that defies her station and manages to find a man who allows her to be true to herself.

Now you may think Ms. Kleypas stretched reality a bit by creating a female doctor for a book which takes place in the 1800's, but there was such a doctor at that time. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first female doctor in England, was the inspiration for Garrett Gibson. As a nod to the real life doctor, Ms. Kleypas used Elizabeth's maiden name for her character's first name. Garrett, of 'Hello Stranger', is a smart, strong, independent, and courageous woman. Taking a wild guess, I imagine her namesake couldn't have achieved what she did in the time period she lived if she didn't possess all those same qualities. I recall a couple of years ago seeing information about Elizabeth Garrett Anderson in a Google Doodle celebrating her 180th birthday. I'm curious if that is what inspired the idea for this character in Ms. Kleypas' mind?

Ethan is a man of mystery, quite literally. He's a secret agent for the crown, although no one but a select few knows it. He is a very fun, smart, sexy, and complex individual with a lot of baggage. His first appearance in this book has him following Garrett. Now, this could be seen by some as being stalker like behavior, but I didn't get that vibe. He sees this beautiful woman entering time and time again a bad section of town at night to help out her patients and he wants ensure nothing bad happens to her. He does his best to go unnoticed and lurks in the shadows. He never intends to make contact with her, but after three randy, drunk, young men plan to assault her, he takes action. I rather loved this and I think it both charmed and maddened Garrett in equal measures.

The song that was playing in my mind was Johnny River's - Secret Agent Man from 1966...

'There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number and taken away your name'

I couldn't help but give this one 5 out of 5 roses. I absolutely loved it and all the little details Ms. Kleypas incorporated into the story. I felt I passed through a looking glass and came out in a different time period. There was plenty of suspense, drama, and romance with a couple of twists and turns thrown in. I rather enjoyed seeing these two get to know one another and fall in love. I adored how each saw marriage as something they dare not wish for, but secretly wanted. I also loved how each managed to help emotionally heal the other. On the Lisarenee Romance Rating Scale, this one earned a STEAM rating--too hot for a fan, but you still have a handle on things. You should use extreme caution when reading a book with this rating in public. People may inquire as to why you looked flustered and flushed. I HIGHLY recommend this one.",1519776000,5

7394,241,284,"Neil Gaiman says he first encountered the Norse myths in the pages of Marvel Comics. I first encountered the Norse Myths in the pages of school textbooks. I later discovered livelier versions, and he later discovered more complete versions, truer to the original sources.

One important difference is that Gaiman is an excellent writer, and he became interested in researching the myths and presenting them to new generations in a form both true to the sources and engaging for modern readers.

Or, in this case, as is most appropriate for ancient myths, listeners.

In his introduction, he discusses what we do, and tantalizingly, what we don't know, about the Norse gods. We know Odin and Thor and Loki, the Norns and the giants, and others, but there are also gods for whom only and some bare details remain, with no surviving stories to retell.

Both his words and his reading of them breathe life into the stories we have. None of the Norse gods are simple and straightforward evocations of merely a few traits, nor are they what we'd consider fully rounded characters. They are, nevertheless, compelling, especially with Gaiman, an excellent oral storyteller as well as an excellent writer, reading his own retellings of their tales.

It's a very good few hours' listening.

Recommended.

7395,596,1897,"I loved this book!  I have been a huge fan of Lisa Kleypas for a long time but for some reason I haven't read a lot of her work during the past few years.  I can see now that this has been a big mistake on my part and that I should have made time for the Ravenels series because this was oh so good.  I loved it on the first page, the last page, and all the pages in between.

The characters in this book were amazing.  Dr. Garrett Gibson was such a refreshing character.  She was willing to do what made her happy instead of what society expected of her.  Can you even imagine the guts it would take to be the only female doctor in England?  Garrett had the toughness needed to excel in her profession.  Ethan Ransom was so easy to like.  He started out as a bit of a mystery and worked to help keep Garrett safe.  The more we learned about Ransom the more that I liked him.

Garrett and Ethan were wonderful together.  I love that we get to see them with each other at the start of the book and the chemistry is there from the start.  It only grows stronger as the book progresses.  Ethan quickly showed that he is a romantic at heart and his words had me swooning quite a few times.  While the chemistry between them was off the charts, they also really showed a lot of respect for each other and just seemed to enjoy being in each other's company.  These two just belonged with each other.

There are some pretty exciting moments in the story.  I did worry about how things would work out for a little while.  There are some pretty serious nail biting moments in this book and a few characters that seemed to make the perfect villain since they were easy to hate.  There are also some really lovable secondary characters in this book.  I haven't read the other books in the series so I am not sure if West has played a large role in the other stories or not but I loved him. Just as Ethan had the ability to make me swoon, West often made me laugh.  I really hope West gets his own book very soon.

I highly recommend this book to others.  This book had all of the elements that I hope for when I pick up a romance with a fantastic plot, amazing characters, off the chart chemistry, a few laughs, and moments that melted my heart.  The only thing about the book that I am not sure that I like is the cover.  I think that the cover is very pretty but it looks way too modern for the story.  I can deal with a cover that I am not sure about because watching Garrett and Ethan find their happily ever after was a wonderful reading experience.  I am definitely going to be reading the other books in the series very soon.

7396,464,1898,"Im of two minds about this title: it started slowly and felt rather disjointed as two of the primary characters are introduced and some of their stories are revealed. It is much later in the book when the third character is brought in, and the points of view from memory and current thoughts flip between the three. This also wasn't a read in one siting title for me: it required time between sections and chapters to absorb the progress and find some of the wonderful bits that created simple connections in lives  the parallel between Sunnys troika family and the triad that she, Kit and Rusty became. The Robbers library  a Carnegie seed-funded library (one of 9 and one academic ) in New Hampshire (all still functioning in their original buildings from the early 1900s with the exception of the academic library) and its conection to Sunny  in serving community service after a failed theft of a dictionary because all the books that are or ever will be are in it, and the transition from Robers (the surname of the French-Canadian mill owner whos investment helped to fund and fill the library building after the Carnegie grant.  Oh- there are more  and each comes to play in unique ways that are both quite clever and feel natural.  But this isn't a story of the library or the books within it, although the book has many literary and poetic references: it is a story of the community built around the reading tables and the people who come to socialize, research, work and rely on the constancy and solidity of a building and its purpose.

The three characters are Kit, the reference librarian, new to town, rather removed and isolated from jovial or even personal interactions with patrons. Sunny, a teenager raised in an unconventional way, noschooled and serving a 12 week sentence by the court to work at the library as punishment for her attempts to steal a dictionary. Lastly there is Rusty, arriving in the little town of Riverton on a quest for found money after he lost near everything in the financial collapse.  The story starts and ends with Kit at the center, as her story and love of poetry and literature become the pivot point of the story.  You have to be willing to go slowly through the story memories of therapy and the lessons she took, mocked, questioned and ultimately relied on as she moves forward through her days all lead to her finally sharing her whole story  in bits and pieces until it feels as if the pressures are too much: both Rusty and Sunny shared worries, concerns and their stories  and there is a sense of quid pro quo from her  as if shes sharing despite herself at first: surprising both her and those around her.  Yet, the stories shared in different voices all come together like pieces of a puzzle: each of these characters comes together filling in edges, bits of the center, until they are whole.  With secondary characters from both patrons and employees in the library, a bit of the run-down town and moments of community, and the loss of a library regular whose presence will be long-lasting in memory and act  the story does take some unexpected turns and twists.

Halperns writing style is intriguing here: from the three lives who intersect and provide support (grudgingly at first) to one another  and the little moments that bring the pieces together as these lives meet, correlate and bond are unlike any story Ive previously read.  From learning about the Carnegie libraries to spotting moments of description that could be any one of several different places in western New Hampshire, there were bits that surprised, like little Easter eggs, throughout the story.  While not a breezy, read in one sitting book: it demands (and encourages) you to spend time and meander along, picking up steam and speed as the path is defined.

7397,681,1897,"Oh my gosh, this was simply a marvelous book. First off, this book made me appreciate the advancement in medicine. Some of the things in this book seem kind of archaic, but they were cutting edge for the time. So, seeing how some of those things were performed backed them made me grateful for how they have progress since then. Now about Hello Stranger. Yes, you could read this book without the previous books, and be somewhat fine. However, there are some things that happen in previous stories that help you understand this particular story. What happen in Devil in Spring kind of leads up to what happens in Hello Stranger. I would recommend reading the books in order.

So, the medical stuff and the political unrest is a big part in this story, but we also have a love brewing here. We have level-headed Garrett Gibson. Poor girl. She's the only female doctor in all of England, so she has to prove that she's the best. However, some tall dark stranger strolls into her life, because honestly she does need saving from herself, here and there. She can be pretty stubborn. Now Ethan Ransom can be pretty stubborn too, but he's always looking out for Garrett. Plus, he feels that she could be a weakness to him, so the best solution would be cut himself off of her. Because that always works in the long run. Yet these two work better when together. Both independent, but somehow they know how not to stifle one another.

I found Hello Stranger pretty fascinating read. I mean with all the medicine Garrett is doing, Ethan trying to save England. I like how Lisa made Ethan come realize he doesn't have to be like his parents, the ones who raised him, and the one that helped sired him. I wonder if there will be more Ravenel children popping up in this series or if the ones we have met are it. I can't wait to read West story. He sounds like he's going to be a hoot. Overall, Hello Stranger was a pretty good read.

7399,727,1900,"I can't honestly think of another book about a homeless teen, written for teens, that I've ever seen (though I'm sure they exist). Rufener writes Linden's story with such sensitivity and nuance; what I love best about WHERE I LIVE is that it's not a story of a high school girl's homelessness, it's a story about a high school girl, dealing with regular high school girl problems (homecoming! boys! bullies!) that just happen to be complicated by the fact of her secret homelessness. It also has one of the most believable love triangles (more like a rectangle, really) that I've ever read; Rufener perfectly captures the confusion and ambiguity of high school crushes and relationships.",1519776000,5
7400,1088,1802,"Towards the beginning of February,  I was in a book slump. And usually the only thing that helps with my book slumps is a Jennifer L. Armentrout book. And sure enough, it worked.
  Julia is on the brink of starting a brand new job in Louisiana. Unknowingly she goes out in style her last night in her hometown.... with her boss, Lucian de Vincent. When she finally gets there, things are much different than she expected, both the job and with Lucian......
  Obviously my favorite part of this was the characters lol I'm not sure what it is about JLA's bad boys, but they are always my favorite. And Lucian was no different. He was super hot and of course super mysterious. I also loved ""Ms. Hughes."" She was the usual JLA heroine, but for some reason I connected with her a bit more. And of course them togeteher was everything I hoped it would be. They were so great together and I found myself not wanting to put the book down.
  I think I liked it so much because of the setting. If you don't know, I LOVE New Orleans. Me and my husband actually try to go at least once a year. (This year ALA Annual is there and I AM ALL FOR IT!) The haunting setting and the mention of a haunted mansion was all I needed to love it. I loved that JLA even paid homage to Bourbon Street and said that they stay away from there because it's for tourists. Which is VERY true lol I'm not a native, but I am from a place where tourists visit alot and I know the places to stay away from lol
  As for the secrets at the end, I was actually plesantly surprised. I had become so invested in one character, I wasn't expecting the ending and all the other secrets that came with it. This was the first time I was so lost in a thriller that I wasn't trying to find out what was going on before it got to the end. I'm usually trying to figure it out at about 35%, but this time it didn't even cross my mind. I was too invested in ""Ms. Hughes"" and Lucian.
  This read was all that I expected it to be and more. I loved seeing them together and I loved all the mysteries and secrets surrounding the brothers. Everything was just what I needed to pull me out of the reading funk I've been in!",1519776000,5
7401,1071,1647,"excerpted from my full review:

I'm torn over this book. On one hand, any new resource is good. We have a dire need for more views on mental illness, and this writer/husband needed an outlet. It's one of very few books dedicated solely to the loved ones of those living with mental illness. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with illness of a loved one. Lukach has the ability to focus solely on his experience because he doesn't have to deal with the extraneous issues that quickly take over in 99.9% of US cases.

Three episodes/hospitalizations in the first five years of being diagnosed with a severe mental illness is not unusual, and the awful trial and error nature of psychopharmacology gets a little sunlight here. This book does best early on, when he's furious, scared and confused at the sometimes arbitrary, often misleading and always rigid rules of psychiatric care. I highlighted huge sections of these early encounters with hospitals and staff because despite the many who feel similarly, in my decades in the field, very little has changed beyond some nicer wording. So I cheered him for this.

My discomfort with the book came after that. By the end it seems like he thinks he's got it all worked out. Five years into severe psychiatric illness is a very short time. I don't even know that his lovely wife actually qualifies as severely mentally ill. She is able to hold down a job between her three episodes and *has* a between period. Of course it feels painstaking to all involved, but cancer of any stage feels painstaking, yet there are still stages. Then there's the ability this family has to quit jobs, pay out of pocket - not a single word about most people's biggest nightmare: insurance companies stopping their loved ones from getting the care they need. He need not tell anyone else's story, but his story is mild compared to most.

Everyone has a right to tell their story, but this one felt a bit pat in the latter parts, like he has learned what the right things to say are, and he's saying them, but if I had this guy on my therapy couch, I'd be asking some tough questions about his pretty words. He got his feelings out, and that's what I got from this book: his feelings. It's a very one-sided, tiny slice of the beginning of his family's mental health journey. I wish them well, but I can't say I'd recommend this book to many people who want to learn anything more than one lucky family's story.",1519776000,3
7402,138,1872,"In a time when lying about anything and everything sometimes makes discerning the truth, even wondering if there is anything like real truth, hard, Laura Lippman comes along with a suspense novel built on a foundation of lies two people tell each other. Who is the real bad person here? Adam Bosk, private eye, hired by an unscrupulous insurance broker to suss out Polly/Pauline Costello/Ditmars/Smith/Hansen? Or Polly, to use one of her names, cunning and apparently on the run from something or someone?

Adam gets an assignment from Irving Lowenstein to find Polly. Hes sure she has absconded with a big pot of insurance money of which he believes he deserves a share. Adam finds her in a small Delaware ocean town that has seen better days, Belleville, working in a tired bar and fry joint called the High-Lo. Shes fair skinned, a redhead and her sunburn catches his eye. He gets to know her at first to discover where the money is. But she proves too alluring and her allure overpowers his good judgment and experience. In spite of himself, he falls for her. He doesnt entirely trust her, knowing what he knows, but he cant help himself. He gets a job as a cook, perfect as he has had previous culinary training, to be near her.

Polly has a talent for attracting and manipulating men, up to a point. When Adam finds her, she is escaping her current marriage to Gregg Hansen. Previously, she was married to a cop, an arson investigator who raped and brutalized her throughout their marriage, until she could stand it no more. It reveals little to tell you she drove a knife through his heart as he slept. She didnt, however, escape punishment, at least not entirely. She has plenty of other secrets, too.

7403,1088,1893,"Looking over people's reviews for this one, it was obvious, you either loved it or didn't care for it. As someone who has been in a reading slump this month, I'm lucky enough to say I loved it!

  Ana and her friends are outlaws. including the bot D09, her best friend. They always find themselves getting into trouble, especially when Ana & Co steal the coordinates to a lost ship that may have to potential to save her friend. But then an Ironblood beats her to it, everything begins to change and Ana realizes she doesn't know half as much about her friends and all their lives as she thought.

  I kept reading that this has some Anastasia moments in it, and it made me realize that I had never seen it before. Ok, so ahead and throw tomatoes at me, but I think that's the reason why I loved this so much. Everything that those who have seen it might have seen coming, I didn't. And so when everything started to come out, I was shocked and didn't see it coming. All those surprises caught me off guard and made me love the book so much more.

  I also loved the non-stop action. For the most part, it seemed as if it were a setup for the next book in the series (there is another book right?) but to me it was never boring. It felt a bit like a filler, but since there was always something intense or exciting going on, that made me forget that it was a filler. I can always tell when I love a book based on how many times I update my Goodreads and well, I updated it alot with this one lol

  I was also really interested in the romances in this one. One was completely out of the blue and I found it super interesting that Poston went that route. It was unlike anything I have read and I was shocked when I read it. But let me tell you, that did NOT stop by ship from going down. My other ship sailed as well and I'm very happy with it. However, with both of them, I was NOT happy with the outcomes. But I'll leave that alone to avoid spoilers.

  But weirdly, what I loved the most about this book was the way it was written. For it to be sci-fi, I think I most enjoyed it because it was just sci-fi because of the updated technology and being in space and bots. I'm not a ""sciencey"" person, I usually gravitate (no pun intended) towards sci-fi books that seem light on the science. And since this one didn't go too in-depth with it, I really enjoyed it. I can see where this may not be for some people, but because it merely talked about it, it helped me to love this.

  However, the one thing I DIDN'T care for was..... the world-building. Since space or the Iron Kingdom isn't a place I'd likely visit, I wanted to see more of the world. Poston merely glanced over the details of the palace and outside the Kingdom, only enough to get by. I would have loved to see more of their world.
 When I love a book I find that I can talk FOREVER about it. Clearly, this is one of those times. There was so much suprise and intrigue in this book with characters that made me fall in love with them. I can't wait to see what else is going to happen in Ana's world.",1519776000,4
7404,274,1838,"The Queen's Rising is an epic fantasy by debut author Rebecca Ross. When Brienna was ten years old, she was taken to Magnalia House by her grandfather. The girls who live there must study and master one of the five passions - art, music, dramatics, wit or knowledge. Brienna is not like the other girls, who are all from wealthy families. Her Valenian mother died when Brienna was still young and her Maevan father is unknown to her. Now seventeen, she is hoping to master the passion of knowledge by the upcoming summer solstice and gain a patron. Things don't go as planned for her though, as she unexpectedly becomes embroiled in a plot to overthrow the king of Maevana.

Brienna is a mass of contradictions. She doesn't know who she really is or what she wants. While her friends at Magnalia House come from important noble families, Brienna's own remains a mystery to her. This affects her more deeply than she realizes and leads her down an uncertain path. The story itself sounds more complex than it is, and I found it quite easy to read. The importance of having a passion was inspiring. There is also a strong focus on female bonds and family relationships. The novel relies more heavily on the development of the characters and the dynamics between them, than on a lot of action, although there is an exciting battle scene which kept me on the edge of my seat. From descriptions of the past to interactions in the present, everything is composed with exquisite detail. The settings are gorgeous, and I became immersed in the sublime backdrops of castles and sumptuous landscapes.

7406,170,1850,"Words like erudite, eloquent, incisive, revelatory, and inimitable feel too lukewarm to truly describe Baldwin's timelessness and mastery as a writer and observer.  As I'm sure countless other readers have attested, too much of what Baldwin puts forth in these two essays remains relevant and timely, the long shadow of America's original sin only marginally lessened with the dreadful foundation of that sin all too present in modern times.  The opening essay is a letter to Baldwin's nephew upon the century anniversary of emancipation.  To say this essay is heart rending is understatement.  One is overwhelmed by the tenderness and melancholy, the hope and despair, the intense disappointment and encompassing love expressed by Baldwin as he recounts the fraught role of race in America.  The second essay explores race and religion, and much of what Baldwin has perceived about these topics (including the deeply flawed morality that would allow the white majority to persist in the subjugation of blacks) could have been written five days rather than fifty years ago.  Baldwin is a masterful writer, a powerful intellectual, and in these essays he forcefully speaks truth to power.

This is a big book, with a lot going on.  The book jacket synopsis barely scratches the surface.  The story line, characters, dialogue, and prose are marvelous.  Gaiman has built a ""can't put it down"" book.
As with other books that tackle big topics (religion, morality, etc.), ""American Gods"" has its fans and its detractors.  With more than half a million ratings on Goodreads, 4/5 stars accounting for 76%, I'd say the jury is solidly in the positive camp.  Count me as one.

The problem with the book is, however, precisely that. In an attempt to be authoritative, the author has compiled a tedious, poorly edited, rambling monstrosity.  Heres an example:

""Some journalists have uncomprehendingly lauded these results as a refutation of evolutionary psychology and what they see as its politically dangerous implication of a human nature shaped by adaptation to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.""

The book is full of such writing and for most points in the book, the author would have ... seven reasons ... with a detailed narrative on each. The reader is left to determine for her/himself which three are the higher order reasons to focus on.

Terribly long, poorly edited, and unnecessarily voluminous read devoted to explaining what has already happened. Hopefully a smart teaching assistant will write a more enjoyable executive summary.",1519776000,2
7423,496,1896,"{My Thoughts}
What Worked For Me
Realities of a Natural Disaster in the 1930s  We all know what its like when tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes strike today. We often times witness the devastation as its happening and we see how quickly people respond and aid arrives. Now go back 80 years and think how different it would be, especially for the people of that time. The tornado at the heart of Promise actually happened and the people had NO warning that it was coming. Minrose Gwin did a wonderful job combining historical facts with fiction to share what that experience might have been like. Buildings, cars, animals and people were sucked up into the air. At the heart of Promise are two babies plucked from their mothers arms. As in disasters today, people were quick to help, but the quality of help was limited and much slower. I found the historical aspect of Promise fascinating.

A Study of Casual Racism  There can be no doubt that 1930s Mississippi abounded with racism, and Gwin addressed this in ways both big and small. The differences in the homes of whites and blacks also made a difference in survival rates. The bigger, sturdier homes of whites offered so much more protection. After the disaster, Dovey was expected to help out a white family even as she was searching for her own family. A hospital for whites sprung up much quicker than the one for blacks. White citizens were taken by train to Memphis, while blacks were poured into boxcars. Different morgues were set up. Even with a storm that saw no color boundaries, boundaries were everywhere.

What Didnt
S.L.O.W.  I don't mean to be dramatic, but Promise was often just too slow. There was a lot of repetition that just wasn't necessary and I felt like the author often went off on tangents that added little to the story. I skimmed quite a bit and thats never a good sign.

Repetitive Events  A couple of similar events running throughout a story can be the cornerstone of what makes it great. I felt like there were too many in Promise: girls being bothered by boys, confused identities, dreams that made no sense, women fainting, being unable to find family. The fact that repetition happened so often, took away from the events that were truly important to the story.

Bird Imagery  Gwin used a lot of bird references and bird imagery in her novel. I felt like she was hitting me over the head with it, but more than that, it added nothing to the heart of her story. I could have easily done without all of it.

That morning the flutter had taken up residence in her upper thigh; she had watched the skin jump with it. Was she becoming a bird? Since the storm, she flew through her dreams. She flew without fear, with a steady heedless curiosity; nothing could hold her down, not the sweet dear earth, not the people who held her life in place. She wondered if she were getting ready to die.

{The Final Assessment}
While I enjoyed much of the heart of the story that was Promise, overall I cannot recommend it without serious reservations. I think the book would have been much more interesting had it been more selectively edited, and had it stayed focused on the heart of Doveys and Jos stories. Grade: C

Note: I received a copy of this book from the publisher (via Edelweiss) in exchange for my honest review.",1519862400,3
7424,464,1896,"Gwin tells the tale of the 1936 Tupelo tornado from two perspectives: Dovey, an African-American laundress and Jo, a young white girl and daughter of a Judge and schoolteacher.  Simply surviving the storm when so many didnt, then holding on to hope and determination to survive and find family and help become the skeleton of this tale  allowing readers in to lives and situations that feel plausible and probable, even as some of the underlying discrimination and unfairness persist.  Working from actual accounts, guessing at numbers of affected (African Americans and their names and numbers weren't counted), and managing to bring a story of intersected lives through proximity and abuse to life.

The devastation and shock from the two survivors when they see just how the landscape has changed: rain, hail, wind and mud, all concealed in darkness that hides other dangers, human and topographical.  The unending scenes of death and featherless chickens, lack of potable water and food, dry clothing, and no shoes, we see the make-do personal caretaking as Dovey continues to put one foot forward in her search for husband, granddaughter and great-grandbaby. As part of the governments efforts to alleviate the depression, dispatches of relief arrive reasonably quickly: from medical staff and medicines to food, water, undertakers to care for the dead and the Red Cross: making lists of dead, survivors and proving intermediate and triage care for the citizens. And to be clear  the lists were of white citizens, even as the black citizens were provided minimal assistance as well.  Through Doveys story we see a life of struggle and tumult: yet full of love of family- and her story unfolds with tragedies and emotion, tying us to her search and finding light in her simple belief that she will find her family alive and well.  Through Jos story, we see a young woman who is fanciful and often unrealistic, unable to remember (and it feels more like she doesnt see it as important) Doveys name, even as she demands, orders and lastly cajoles her to send someone back to help.  More of Jos upbringing (and callous disregard  if recognized as a hateful thing later) show as she demands (often imperiously) action from others, black and white, action to care for her needs and that of the brother she found dangling in the bushes at the front of her house.

From horrific injuries, fears and the simple struggle to survive: the emotional intensity of the story never quite leaves, coming to a head when Jo with her little brother (much changed from the fractious and colicky child shed known the past months) finally come face to face with Dovey, now in boxcar housing arranged by the Red Cross  and secrets and realities are revealed  in ways that only time could show if effects were long-lasting for Jo. Family secrets and shames unearthed, families of privilege brought low and unable to exhibit even the most basic of survival skills, and the ever-present separation between the races: in medical care, housing, basic necessities and even casual encounters on the street stand out shockingly: that such an unimportant affectation should be so integral to the society as to be adhered to in times when simple necessities become luxuries is a testament to the stupidity and ignorance that is integral in racism. Unfortunately, the systematic complicity of that racism extended to record-keeping by the government: historic accounts of this story are lily-white, and from the authors notes, the settlements and people were relocated and or lost to recorded history.

The book is beautifully readable: both Jo and Dovey bring their families and lives to life in their recollections and memories, the three characters that are ever-present from the early chapters (Dovey, Jo and the baby) are clearly present in each word and scene.  The horrific aftermath of a devastating storm, the strange focus on what is important at that moment, and the faith that Dovey caries like a sword in her search for her people is striking and heartfelt.  A tale that feels so plausible and possible as to be a memoir from two survivors of the tornado: this needs to be a part of your upcoming reads.

Its my mission this year to read more Young Adult and discovering that Rachel Caine and Ann Aguirre had written a YA Sci-Fi, I knew I had to get my hands all over it, especially as it had such a beautiful cover. Of course a beautiful cover can hide a multitude of sins, in the case of Honor Among Thieves this wasn't the case. It was an interesting read with a unique set of characters, which left me wanting more.

It was told from Zaras point of view and one of the aspects I like most about this book was seeing her character journey. Admittedly, at the beginning her callous and hard exterior is difficult to connect to and like. However, the more you understand about her and her painful past the more relatable she becomes. And as she connects with Nadim and a few other characters she begins to reveal a softer side and, by the end of the book I realised my opinion of her had shifted.

This book was also a bit of a slow starter, with Caine and Aguirre revealing the world at a sedate pace. This all changes once Zara starts the Tour and more and more hidden truths are revealed and the pace of the book shifts up a few gears. Or maybe I was just reading a lot faster, I couldn't wait to see what secrets the Leviathan were hiding from humans and how it would affect Zara, Nadim and crew.

Although this book doesnt have an immediate hook it is worth reading on, it was a really interesting idea with some complex and intriguing characters, including one giant sentient living space ship!

7435,202,160,"I have been reading a few Agatha Christie books these days and in some ways, I'm sad that I didn't seek them out earlier. ""Death on the Nile"" is her 17th foray into the M. Poirot series and by now, she's an old pro at setting the scene, establishing the characters, and providing a good mystery.

Well-renowned detective M. Poirot has been looking forward to a trip on the Nile River for quite some time but trouble seems to follow him wherever he goes, even if it's on vacation. What was supposed to be a leisurely trip ends up becoming another murder mystery for him to solve.

The voyage features an ensemble of main and supporting characters, from Linnet Ridgeway, the rich heiress who ultimately gets shot in the head to Simon Doyle, the fianc she stole from her best friend, Jacqueline de Belleforte. Linnet's murder acts as the main mystery for M. Poirot but there are a number of subplots that need to be tidied up as well.

I enjoyed the mystery, and I felt that Christie's books are often a good length. You never feel like things are dragged on for the sake of things, and every character that appears is supposed to be there.",1519862400,4

It starts right after Ian's sisters wedding. Ian is very happy for her, of course, but unsettled about the changes her marriage will bring to his relationship to her. So he jumps into his motorcar thinking a long drive will give him time to settle his angst. Nothing like a dead body in the middle of a deserted road to take his mind off himself. Two more deaths later, Ian finally manages to put two and two together. He does come up with four, but not in the way he expected. Todd played this one very close to the chest, so I didn't see this one coming either until the very end. All of the victims were very nice people who didn't deserve to die. Many of the characters surrounding them were not nice people and I, at least, would not have been sorry if they would have been the victims. No such luck. My only regret is that Todd didn't include an epilogue to let us know how things turned out for a woman named Vivian Moss, who had been badly used and abused by one of the unsavory characters.

7443,1052,1893,"**Egalley received from publisher through Edelweiss in return for an honest review**

When I first heard the words Anastasia in space I knew I had to at least try this book. What I didn't expect was how much I was going to fall in love with it. This whirlwind adventure of space pirates and lost princesses took me by surprise and just wowed me to no end. It is gorgeous, it is breathtaking, and it is completely impossible to put down.

With words that blend together in poetic beauty and steal the breath away with their loveliness, Ashley Poston has created a world and characters that just made my heart sing with pleasure. The quotes  so many lines in this book had me smiling and gasping and trying very hard to catch my breath with how gorgeous they were. And everything from beginning to end was just absolutely spectacular  the world-building, the characterizations, the plot  all of it was written beautifully and in a way that had me falling into the world immediately and not wanting to climb back out for one second.

It is fast-paced and moves quickly, but only once or twice did I feel were things moving too quickly. Mainly partway through the beginning, when they reach the Tsarina and suddenly everything is happening and there is action and Robb is suddenly realizing his feeling for Jax whom he had only just met like ten hours prior  I just felt like things were jumping the gun a little there. I was already on board with them two as a pair, don't get me wrong, but I would have liked a little more time seeing them getting to know one another before they suddenly decided they wanted to kiss.

The characters, though  oh wow the characters. All four of the main characters  Ana, Di, Jax and Robb  had so much depth and wonder to them, and the way they grew and shaped themselves over the course of the novel was beautifully rendered. From the first moment I met him I knew I was going to love Robb and he did not disappoint. And as I grew to know the others I fell in love with them as well. Surprisingly enough Ana was the last one I came to really care about, but she is a great character and definitely grew on me. And of course the romantic relationships were absolutely breathtaking. I didn't know mere promises could make one smile so much. The relationships these characters had with one another, and with others in the novel, definitely helped change and redefine who they were how they viewed themselves and who they wanted to be.

I thought the supporting characters were excellent as well, especially Siege and Anas relationship with her and the rest of the crew, especially when juxtaposed with Robbs relationship with his family. Some of these characters did seem a little single-minded at times, but there were also times when there were hints at what lay underneath that showed there was more than what met the eye. I think there was one character in particular that I would have liked to gotten to know better, and that was Viera Carnelian, the Captain of the Royal Guard, because there was just something about her that I felt like I was missing. Even seeing her frenemy relationship with Robb some more would have been interesting, I thought. Otherwise, though, I thought all of the supporting characters were great and helped filled the story in wonderfully.

Honestly, I absolutely loved almost everything about this book - the plot, the characters, and Postons writing style is just oh-so-gorgeous. Half the time I kept forgetting that this was supposed to be a retelling because I was just so immersed in the story itself. It is definitely an edge-of-your-seat, breath-stealing adventure filled with mystery, intrigue, romance, and lots and lots of action. If you loved The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer then this is definitely a book for you.",1519862400,5

7446,642,1316,"My Review of This Could Hurt by Jillian Medoff

Jillian Medoff , Author of This Could Hurt, has written a unique and intriguing novel that combines big business with personal lives. The genre of this novel is fiction. Jillian Medoff  describes her characters as complex, complicated, lonely, confused, flawed and emotional perhaps due to the circumstances of the times.

In our society, everyone has to  work to pay the bills, and some people are lucky to find a job that offers them everything that they are looking at. There are professional people who are doctors, nurses, teachers, police-officers, postal-workers, government employees, and many others that work in set organizations. In Jillian Medoffs novel, the setting is a big company that holds the executives responsible, who  hold the employees responsible for productivity.  At Ellery Consumer Research, financial changes occur with the economic climate. The bottom line is to produce more, with costs being less. Often that means instead of hiring, letting go and firing employees. Of course this is very stressful.

At Ellery Consumer Research we get to glimpse at the lives of several people and their life in the workplace and out of the workplace.  Rosa  is one of the women who made it to the top of the corporate ladder.  She tries to meet and anticipate the needs of her staff, even though she has a high pressure job. Rosa does try to be fair, and this is even more stressful, as she finds out  who is loyal and those who betray the company. There is a big difference in living to work, and working to live.

Not everyone can take the stress, and several of the employees are lonely and looking for a relationship. Some are looking for friends. Some of the characters are go-getters and others are lazy and don't carry their weight.  Rosa tries to find a balance between what is good for her employees, and what benefits the company.

When something traumatic occurs, everyone is forced to take a deep look at what they really want.  For those who enjoy some controversy and a different type of novel, I would highly recommend this.",1519862400,4

7452,1071,118,"I reread this for the Catch-up Book Club on Goodreads, and I'm glad I did. The last time I read Anne's diary I was younger than she was while writing it, and again, I'm annoyed at myself for being such a dumb kid. Also, it's changed since my initial read. There's more and we get more background in the newest editions.

I hate using stars to ""rate"" a journal that itself says how boring, juvenile, tawdry, silly and personal it is repeatedly, but I'm going to if only to keep the rating I gave it earlier and reinforce it.

As an older reader I felt for Anne's parents early in the book. She is oblivious to the many goings-on in preparation to go into hiding. She's living a child's life with her new birthday diary, while her parents have moved the family more than once to avoid Hitler only to get stuck in Holland. Nonetheless, they prepare for hiding by taking things piece by piece to the annex and preparing as much as possible before being forced to flee. I was impressed by her father Otto's ability to allow her as much carefree childhood as he could during what must have been incredibly terrifying days.

Anne's earliest entries show she's a child with a keen understanding that many people only show masks to the rest of us. This observation repeats itself through the journal, and her torment with others being less genuine than she would like is, in itself, heart wrenching. An historical document, a life in hiding with its mundanity and extraordinary qualities equally prevalent, this diary shows both extreme fear and incredible boredom. She goes from child to philosopher repeatedly.

Interested in a huge variety of things, Anne keeps herself busy writing not just in her diary but also short stories, genealogical studies, poetry, etc. She's got thoughts and ideals on feminism, love, God, war and peace, the culpability of regular people, families, self, discrimination, motherhood, pain, poverty, medical science, finance, the war machine, religion... This is not an idle idiot scrawling nonsense. She is very capable of growth, and we see it within the diary. She allows for her own earlier ""childish"" writing, yet leaves it included with some additional notes. While she was supposedly editing this for after the war, she remarks more than once that this diary is just for her, that it surely won't be worthwhile to anyone else ever. How wrong you were, Anne Frank.

Anne practices multiple languages, learns history and other subjects, reads voraciously and really only stops in to write in her diary occasionally once she and her family are in hiding. She also stays abreast of her schoolwork, always planning and even trying to expect freedom just around the corner. She's up on the war, keeps an eye on the Allied Forces and fully expects them to succeed. She knows she's being optimistic. She says she's doing it purposely. She watches the squabbles around her, getting annoyed at other people's annoyance, and only occasionally allows herself to wish for things she can't have. Instead, she simply plans for ""after"" the war.

One moment really stood out to me. While discussing the war, Anne notes that despite nationality, she believes that after the war ""We can never be just Dutch or just English or whatever, we will be Jews as well."" This is, to me, a remarkable statement. While Zionism had already begun, it becomes very clear that Anne - isolated and sheltered from the worst thus far - has figured out something absolutely vital about the world post WWII. Much earlier she had started wrestling between her German identity and her Jewish identity and she will begin to include her Dutch identity too.

The Diary of A Young Girl is exactly that and so much more.",1519862400,5

Of course, knowledge is power and would help but not knowing will not detract from the story at all.

7459,986,1075,"If anything, I think having such low expectations has helped me actually finish The Last Star. Because unfortunately my suspicions turned out to be right... And I can't say I had a great time reading this one. The first thing that went wrong was right at the beginning. Why? Let's just say I nearly stopped reading after the first couple of pages of religious babble. This chapter was completely different in style and tone and frankly kind of ruined the introduction to this final book to me... I know it has some connection to what happens later, but I still think the story would have been better off without it. That said, I had a hard time keeping up with the many POV switches and going back and forth between 2nd and 3rd person... This slowed down the pace considerably and made it even harder to connect to the story. As for the characters... Unfortunately taking a break from the series didn't change my opinion of them. I can't stand Cassie or Evan and everything they represent... The icky romance scenes almost made me vomit and the constant 'wanting for sacrifice' just didn't help me warming up to them. In fact, the only character I sort of rooted for was Zombie. But in general, I can't say I really cared about what happened to them. Which is kind of important in a dystopian story where the main goal is finding out if and how the characters survive everything that is thrown at them. The ending was kind of cheesy as well... The only thing I did like was the non stop action, which at least served to take my mind off other things temporarily. But all in all, this series definitely wasn't for me.",1519948800,2

There are so many parts of this book that I related to: Eliza's anxiety and panic attacks, Wallace's desire to write and everyone telling him that he needs to be safe and go to college to get a real job that will be secure instead of chasing his dreams.

Moonlight Sins is the first book in the new de Vincent series. This series is about three brothers and each book features one of them.

The narrators of this book are Lucian de Vincent and Julia Hughes. They are in their late 20s.

The author had mentioned that she didn't really want to say what genre the book was. So this made me super curious. Would the book be a contemporary romance? Would it be a romantic suspense? Or would it have paranormal elements? I don't really want to spoil it. But I definitely wondered if there were ghosts or if the brothers were vampires. There is romance. And there is a mystery. So there is definitely some romantic suspense.

Lucian is part of a super rich family. They live in a mansion. Julia is a nurse and she quits her job to go take care of someone in Louisiana.

The book does feature a mystery. And that part of the book was intriguing. There was one character, Maddie, that really fascinated me. And I was curious to see what would happen with her.

There were a bunch of twists and turns at the end. Although some of them I guessed. This book was quite sexy. And I think that I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been less sexy.

I've heard a lot of good things about this book and then an online book club planned on reading it, so I grabbed a print copy of it. The book lives up to all the hype. It was so, so good.

This is an enemies to lovers story...and like so many enemies to lovers stories, it has a lot of funny moments. But even better, it has so many sweet, memorable moments that were simply bittersweet. The story is told entirely from Lucy's point of view, but there are amazing glimpses of Josh that tell the reader that she may not be understanding the emotions he has behind his actions. The poignant moments in this book literally melted my heart and made this an amazing read.

I loved it so, so much.

An added bonus, Lucy and Josh work for a floundering publisher. The little added details of the side story taking place in the book industry was awesome.

There were so many moments in this story that melted my heart. I loved both the main characters, but OMG...Josh was awesome!! Seriously, a hero that will totally steal your heart.

Review of the audio read by the author!  Joshilyn Jacksons narration was so entertaining I will be listening to all of her future books.

The Almost Sisters starts out silly but fun. The main character has a rendezvous with Batman (yes, Batman!) at a cartoon convention. References to Batman had me chuckling throughout. However, Joshilyn Jackson, in her trademark quirky, fun, theres more to it than meets the eye, style, delves into some deeper issues like race, aging, elder care, and...sisterhood.

7470,66,1897,"Well, darn.  I think it's official.  I'm divorcing Lisa Kleypas.  She's almost batting 0 for me in her latest Ravenel series, none of which are better than 3-star books, IMO.  Even this one, which I had high hopes for, turned out to be a dud, with its slight romance of two underdeveloped characters mixed with a whole lot of historical information dumping.  The H/h relationship doesn't develop.  It just is.  They decide early on they want each other and mostly ineffectually fight the sexual attraction until they don't anymore and then have lots of tediously-detailed sexy scenes that I skimmed, because, really, who needs all that?  I wanted to watch them fall into love, not into bed.

Let's discuss the info dumping.  Kleypas took a hiatus from HRs a few years back before returning with this Ravenel series.  It feels as if during this hiatus she was doing huge amounts of research into Victorian times so she could impress picky readers who don't like anachronistic HRs.  Well, I don't like anachronistic wallpaper stories but I do like a good story.  If I want information about self-defense methods and training, medicine and medical procedures in the 1800s, Victorian train service, various types of locks and patents thereof, early blood transfusions, bacterial count in the Thames, etc., I'll either read some non-fiction on the subject or Google it.  Instead, please give me some appealing characters with a slow-burning romance that touches me viscerally.

Heroine Garrett Gibson should be an admirable character.  She knew what she wanted to be in life and worked hard toward that goal.  After studying medicine in France (because English medical schools didn't admit women), she is now the only female medical doctor working in England.  Well, after all these years of struggle against The Man, with his superior attitudes and mansplaining and all, is it any wonder she's the Queen of Peeve, Prickle and Stubborn Attitude?  Maybe not, but I still wasn't all that fond of her and her ""I've got this.  I don't need you.  I'm a strong, roaring woman with no weaknesses"" attitude.

Now our hero Ethan Ransom is a different animal.  He's the romantic nurturer in the pairing.  Not afraid to show his care and concern and feelings with his Guardian Angel act, flowers, a silver whistle (just call and I'll be there for you), sexy Irish brogue, and heartwarming words.  That's lovely.  What's not lovely is his tedious ""This is the last time you'll see me"" every single time he sees her.  All this supposed self-denial because he doesn't want to endanger her and then he doesn't really deny himself and does endanger her and himself.

Ethan is an ex-policeman, now agent for the Crown.  He's in a spot of trouble at the moment because of terrorist incidents which took place in DEVIL IN SPRING, the previous book of the series.  Now he realizes that his longtime mentor and superior in the department is crooked and working with, not against, the terrorists.  When he tries to collect evidence against this man, the proverbial can of worms is opened and other crooked law enforcement folks pop out and his life and that of Garrett are in jeopardy.

So there is some action/adventure, interspersed with sex between Garrett and Ethan, interspersed with plot lines that can show off Kleypas's research.  There's a near-death experience for Ethan which only Garrett's medical expertise and a blood transfusion can prevent.  There's some cloak and dagger stuff involving the bad guys.  There's some ridiculous sex between doctor and patient only a week or so after patient almost dies.  There's an escape from London by train to the Ravenel estate in Hampshire to get away from the bad guys when it turns out they are no safer there than they would have been staying in London and allowing Ethan to recover more efficiently after his delicate, risky operation.  Darn.  I must stop enumerating the things that upset me.  There were more but enough is enough.

(BTW, an off-topic aside.  Is it necessary for every Ravenel book to have a life-threatening situation to a character which requires bedside care from a SO?  We had Helen caring for Winterbourne after the train accident.  Gabriel staying by Pandora's side after the terrorist incident.  And now this one.)

We also learn about Ethan's pedigree within the Ravenel family and about his financial situation, because, of course, he needs to really be Somebody and a Somebody with Funds.  And speaking of the Ravenel family, next up is West Ravenel's story, a pairing with Gabriel's sister Phoebe.  Another one tying second generation Wallflowers to the Ravenels.  Should I read it?  Will that violate the terms of my divorce?",1519948800,3
7471,52,1897,"Dr. Garrett Gibson is England's only female physician. When she is accosted by three drunk men, she is rescued by Ethan Ransom who's been following her for months. He's been worried about her safety, though Garrett was well able to take down at least one of the men. He's also been fascinated with her though they've only met twice before. We've met Ethan before in the Ravenels series; he works for an undercover operation in the Home Office.
We've also met Garrett earlier in the series, and I'm so happy she got her own book. She's a fascinating character based on a real-life person, Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. I love Garrett. She's a young woman who's been educated at the Sorbonne and is dedicated to medicine and science. She apprenticed under Dr. Joseph Lister, another real person who implemented and practiced sterile surgery, something badly needed in the dirty hospitals of the time.
Ethan is also interesting. He's a by-blow to the Ravenel family though he wants nothing to do with them though they're more than willing to be friendly. It takes a while and some dramatic happenings for him to acknowledge his family. He also has some hidden facets (no spoiler) that make him a great match for Garrett.
Usually, ""spy"" romances are among my least favorite historicals, but this is a wonderful story and so much more in what is one of my favorite series.",1519948800,5

7473,169,1897,"I love historical romances! Ive read most of this authors books and generally liked them, even loved some. This book was no exception. The premise was intriguing - Lady doctor and government spook fall in love. The heroine, Dr Garrett Gibson, was wonderful - pretty, smart, and independent. The hero, Ethan Ransom, was equally wonderful - handsome, strong, and sexy. They had great chemistry and some sizzle. The storyline was entertaining and unpredictable. Overall, I loved it.

7474,61,784,"""THE PERFECT GIRL"" by Gilly Macmillan moves seamlessly between a teenage perspective and an adult one, and does a great job of pulling you right into its story of family dysfunction and buried secrets.  There were just a few times when I got a little bored at the beginning but it never let up at the end.  This book proves that a good crime book doesnt need gore, major twists, or excessive violence to capture and hold your attention; a strong cast of characters and an immersive central mystery will work out just fine.",1519948800,4
7475,241,1850,"James Baldwin was born in New York City in 1924, and grew up in Harlem. He experienced the racism of the pre-Civil Rights era, as well as a harsh, possibly abusive stepfather, and sought the library and the church as refuge.

Teachers recognized him as a gifted young writer in his early teens.

This is a thoughtful, eloquent, often painful to read or listen to, essay on racism and the core contradictions of American culture. In some respects Baldwin was the voice of a generation, and this is still an important read or listen for anyone who wants to understand the underpinnings of how we got where we are today.

Jesse Martin also reads it very expressively and effectively.

Highly recommended.

I bought this audiobook.",1519948800,5
7476,147,269,"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is a classic in the horror genre. Contrary to the numerous subsequent portrayals in film, the original story presents a very different perspective. Rather than a castle laboratory with a mad professor persona along with a hump-backed assistant, Shelley's original tale is of a college student who dabbles in his dorm room and creates the creature. What follows is the creature's actions that span gentile acquisition of language skills to brutal murders arising from his frustration with humanity fearful of his appearance. He haunts and stalks Victor Frankenstein and murders his close friends and loves in an attempt to force V Frankenstein to make him a female companion.

The story is related a series of stories within stories as much of the tale is told by V Frankenstein to the captain of a ship that picks him up while stuck in ice. Victor as been in pursuit of the monster in an effort to destroy him. Within this story is the monster's tale related to Victor of his doings, including his education, which is fairly advanced as he's struggled and failed to insert himself into society. Much of the narrative is spent with V Frankenstein ruminating on his failure with life in general and his role in causing the deaths of so many people around him. Throughout much of the tale, the perspective leads to the possibility that there may be no monster and that all of the events have been perpetrated by a deranged mind of a normal human.",1519948800,4
7477,286,242,"Any time you travel, one of the weirdest and most interesting things is figuring out how to react to a different set of social norms. Ifemelu, the Nigerian-born-and-raised protagonist of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Americanah, experiences this kind of cultural whiplash twice: once, when she transfers from her university in Nigeria to a small college in Pennsylvania and then the second time, fifteen years later when she decides to return to Lagos. That Ifemelu is black and only really experiences what it's like to be black in a predominantly white world once she gets to the United States, as well as the gap between African-Americans and Africans in America inspires her to start a blog about race, which becomes a major source of income for her and helps earn her a fellowship at Princeton. Once the fellowship is over, she shuts down her blog, leaves her longtime boyfriend, and prepares to go back to Nigeria.

She's nervous about going back, not so much because she doesn't have anything lined up there but because it means she'll be back in the same place as Obinze, the man she loved in high school and college but is no longer in touch with. Adichie uses one of my favorite framing devices to structure her novel: she begins with Ifemelu just before she leaves the US, shows us how she got there through flashbacks, and then proceeds forward. I love getting some information but not all of it right up front: it makes me intensely curious to find out how the situation we first encountered came to be. I hate mystery-style books where all the ""answers"" are backloaded...it makes the rest of the book feel like it's treading water before the payoff at the end. Those just leave me annoyed by the time I get to the end, but unwrapping the narrative layers one by one keeps me hooked. And Americanah had me like a fish on a hook.

Not only is her story structure one that I personally respond well to, but Adichie's writing is absolutely magnificent. I marked what feels like half of the book because she has a such a knack for taking feelings that you have or you recognize and phrasing it in a way that hits you right in the gut because it's so dead on and perfect and you never thought about it like that before. And I loved the way she wrote Ifemelu and Obinze's relationship, from their charmed young love to the reason for their separation and that Adichie isn't afraid to give them new partners, partners they experience happiness with even. There's context and nuance, not just to their relationship, but to their lives. The whole book explores shades of gray, no one is either a saint or a villain. They're people, trying hard and messing up and trying again. I think one of the most important things about reading is its potential to increase empathy, to see people outside of the ones like you as having the same kinds of hopes and dreams and fears as you even if their experiences don't look exactly the same. This book is a beautifully written examplar of that exact principle. It's completely fantastic and I totally loved every second of reading it and I recommend it highly.",1519948800,5
7478,52,1073,"My sister recommended this book, knowing I love Wyeth paintings and live in Maine. She also mentioned how it reminded her of our great-grandmother and her brother who lived on a similar farm in Connecticut.
Christina Olsen lived all her life in Cushing, Maine on the farm her ancestors owned for many generations. When she was forty-six years old, Andrew Wyeth and his soon-to-be wife, Betsy, visited. Andy fell in love with the old farmhouse and spent most of his summers there painting in an abandoned upstairs room. Christina became his muse, most famously in the painting Christina's World.
Christina Olson was born in 1893, the eldest child and only daughter, to the last heir of the Hathorn family and the Swedish sailor she married. As a child, she suffered from an illness thought to be polio at the time (it was later diagnosed after her death as probably CMT, a rare debilitating disease). It didn't stop her from her farmwork though she often stumbled and fell, and also suffered cuts and burns as her hands and arms grew weaker and weaker. The two youngest brothers eventually married and moved off the farm, leaving Christina and her brother Al (Alvaro).
As portrayed by Ms. Kline, she is a proud and independent woman despite her disability. Eventually, she dragged herself around the farm, disdaining the use of a wheelchair. She lives a quiet life although there was a time when she had a suitor, a summer visitor who eventually married elsewhere.
As my sister noted, it was easy to recognize the way she lived from my own childhood visits to my great-grandmother. I can remember her churning her butter and pumps in the kitchen sink. Unlike Christina, she and my great-uncle got electricity and running water, but they had a working farm. My mother would bring us up there to pick berries, and we'd roam the woods. Uncle Gene often took his horse and wagon about town. It's a delight to have some of those memories brought back to life in this book as the Olsens lived much the same.
But this book is so much more. It is beautifully written story with descriptive prose that captures vividly the Maine coast. I could feel the bristles of the blueberry barrens, the salt air of the sea, and the calls of the gulls. While the art is important, it is the vignettes of Maine that will stay will me the longest.",1519948800,5
7479,1115,1073,"I loved this book and I love this author's writing style. After reading her previous book, The Orphan Train, which was splendid,  I wondered if I would be disappointed by this book.

7480,86,268,"At first, I couldn't tell where the author was going. It seemed that he was advocating Stone Age societal norms, but it was a setup. The last 35-40 pages make the book worthwhile. It made me think from a point of view that I don't usually explore.  Well done.",1519948800,4
7481,816,1892,"My Once and Future Duke kicks off a new series by Caroline Linden, Wagers of Sin. I believe this series will revolve around gambling at the exclusive Vega Club. Our heroines will be girls with similarly-situated childhoods who met and bonded at their boarding school, dubbed Ms. Upton's Academy of the Unwanted. This was a good start to the series with an independent heroine who was the perfect person to thaw out our stuffy and proper duke.

Sophie Campbell started life with an idyllic childhood with loving parents and the adventure of traveling with them to support her mother's opera career. But when she lost both parents at a young age, Sophie had to learn some hard lessons when her guardianship was given to an uncaring curmudgeon who did the bare minimum to provide for her. Luckily, Sophie's friendship with Georgiana and Eliza provided her a small amount of support and friendly ears when needed. But without a form of support past her 18th birthday, Sophie became an independent young woman willing to do what was necessary to provide for herself. I was impressed with Sophie's ability to maintain marginal respectability when she was supporting herself by gambling. I also admired her willingness to stand up for herself and not be cowed by the men, particularly our duke. She was a good heroine, though she does have one lapse that had me questioning her involving her willingness to believe a rumor without first communicating with our hero.

Jack Lindeville, Duke of Ware, is at his wit's end with his reckless and spendthrift brother, Philip. But his latest rescue of his brother's indebtedness brings him to the Vega Club, a secretive gaming society frequented by our heroine, Sophie. When Jack attempts to teach Philip a lesson, he finds himself stuck at his country estate with a woman who intrigues him at every turn. That being said, I thought Jack was very respectable and honorable. He didn't press unwanted attentions on Sophie and made the most of their time together. I really liked Jack as a hero... his character probably eclipsed the heroine for me. I sympathized with the responsibility he felt for his family and others, but I wished he would have stood up more to his mother who seemed to be overly managing of his person.

There weren't really any secondary storylines in this story, so you really got to focus on the romance and relationship building. The relationship between Jack and Sophie was somewhere between a slow burn and instalove. Their attraction grew while they were at the estate and away from the world, and then it became stolen moments and sneaking around. I liked how the relationship unfolded and was glad that they didn't have too much back and forth about ending things. I felt like Jack was more invested at times than Sophie, or maybe he was just more willing to trust the outcome than she was. But that was likely a product of their class and status in society.

I would have liked to know a little more about Georgiana and Eliza, as the epilogue makes it clear who the next heroine will be. But I suppose we will learn more about their characters as the series progresses.

I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book that I received from the publisher, Avon.",1520035200,4
7482,253,1892,"My Once and Future Duke is a great beginning to a new series. This is a well-written, totally engaging story of opposites attract and love at first sight. Sophie's strength comes through from the very first page. She was orphaned at twelve, basically abandoned by her grandfather and learned to rely on herself. All she is looking for is security and a family to love. Jack became the duke at a young age and takes his responsibilities very seriously. Trying to save and reform his brother from ruining his name and credit, Jack goes to the gambling club to pay off his brother's debt. There he spies Sophie and the adventure begins.",1520035200,5
7483,955,1892,"After slowly and methodically stowing away money from careful gambling at the Vega Club, card sharp Sophie Campbell knows better than to gamble her future away on one risky, scandalous bet. But when novice Jack Lindeville, Duke of Ware throws down a wager-double her savings against a week alone with her-even Sophie can't refuse.

Alas, despite the good odds, Lady Luck has a devious and ruinous sense of humor. Facing certain ruin, the end of her careful plan to amass a small fortune and attract a respectable, if boring husband, Sophie is whisked away to the Duke's country estate.

Jack, entranced by Sophie since tracking his way-ward and gambling addict brother into the Vega Club, is appalled at himself. Stuck by weather with the too-appealing Sophie, they find themselves tumbling into a torrid affair both are sure cannot end in anything but a disaster. But perchance Lady Luck's favor is turning...

JUST angsty enough to make you devour this in one sitting, I cannot wait to read additional books in this new series! Fans of Sarah MacLean's Never Judge a Lady by her Cover will adore this one! A great flip of the trope, it was fantastic to see our heroine be the gambling-savvy, street smart realist. I loved that Sophie had her own home. Plus, the tension and build up to the sexy-times was to die for. Slow-burn with a big pay off.

My only quibble was the complete lack of discussion of the risks of pregnancy. It seemed a bit odd this never crossed either characters' mind even once.",1520035200,5
7484,350,1450,"This book has a lot of elements that I love.  It has generations of family mystery, it is set in England, and it is about sewing and quilting.  However, there is really nothing that sets this book apart from other works of this genre.  The mystery, as well as much of the plot, was predictable and the writing was just okay.  The plot of this book will have completely left my head in a couple of weeks.

Set in Edwardian England, Maria and her best friend are saved from life in an orphanage when their exceptional sewing skills are noticed by a wealthy woman.  Turns out, she takes the girls to Buckingham Palace to sew for the royal family.  The future Prince of Wales is captivated by Maria and they have an affair.  This is the same Prince of Wales who later marries Wallis Simpson and abdicates the throne.  Of course Maria gets pregnant.  The royals send her off to a large home where she thinks she will deliver her baby in luxury.  However, this is actually an insane asylum.  She is kept there for years and is considered delusional because of her unbelievable claims.  She is told her baby boy dies at birth, but she never quite believes it.  To save her sanity, she begins sewing a quilt into which she stitches her story and her emotions.  Years later, a young woman named Caroline discovers the quilt in her mothers attic.  Having just been fired from her banking job and having a degree in design, she sets off to discover the story of the quilt.  She is aided by her best friend and a male newspaper reporter, she uncovers the truth.  She is also newly single, so there may be some romance brewing.  Of course, Caroline is linked to Maria in predictable ways.

This is a fast and easy read.  I gave it three stars because the story is interesting, even though it is predictable.  As a person who sews and does embroidery, I did enjoy the detailed description of the making of the quilt.  It also has a too happy and too predictable ending.  I don't plan to read the authors other work.  It is just okay and the world is full of books!",1520035200,3
7485,9,432,"Even though I did stay with this and find it an entertaining read, I have to score it a three because it was very predictable and did not live up to the psychological thriller billing.  I kept hoping that I was wrong about everything I guessed, so that's what kept me reading.  It was as predicted though, and the main character wasn't doing things that made sense in solving what the reader already has solved.",1520035200,3
7486,582,191,"Reading this book has been a long time coming for me. I heard of it a long time ago, but until recently, didn't realize that it was written by a Christian author. Yes, I said Christian. So if that is a turn off to you, then this may not be the read for you as it has a strong Christian influence. I, however, hope that each and every person decides to pick up this read because it has something to offer anyone of any background. Messages being portrayed and those learned by the characters are too good to pass up.

World Building

A Wrinkle in Time is set initially on Earth, but the town which Meg lives isn't named. From there, the plot jumps to different worlds including Uriel, Camazotz, and Ixchel. There isn't a lot to say about the world building. We get a more defined image of Camazotz than anywhere, but a lot is left to the imagination. Each world varies immensely from one another. Uriel is a place of mythical beings and fantasy. Camazotz is technically-inclined, and Ixchel is straight from the belly of the Sci-Fi genre.

Pacing & Readability

While the plot is consistent, it is consistently slow-going. From the way I perceived it, when something did happen, it happened rapidly and without much explanation or walk-through. I felt that certain areas, especially the finale, could have been drawn out much more, and ended in not so perfect of a way. It seemed too easy...perhaps I am jaded.

Point-of-View & Characters

A Wrinkle in Time is told from the third-person point of view, but mainly hovers over Megs character. Being the main protagonist, we learn most about Megs character and get to know her the best. Its a bit disappointing, because Charles Wallace is incredibly intriguing. Megs other brothers, Sandy and Dennys Murray, hardly get any page time but didn't do much to add to the plot either. Meg's parents also aren't delved into with much depth, besides the fact that their work on the tesseract is extremely important.

Calvin, a schoolmate of Megs, comes from a large family where he isn't noticed much. A jock at school, Meg hasn't interacted with him much. But when she and Charles Wallace come across him at the haunted house, he tags along on their adventure. Throughout the book, Calvin becomes romantically interested in thirteen-year-old Meg, who reciprocates the feelings.

The Mrs. Ws are an interesting, mysterious lot. My first instinct was to think that Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Whatsit represented the Holy Trinity. The three are billions of years old, and they possess qualities of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. But reading further, its clear that they are only supernatural beings, like guardian angels to the trio, as they also give praise to God throughout.

IT, a massive disembodied brain, and The Black Thing, a black cloud that shrouds overtaken worlds are the antagonists in the story. Representing all things evil, IT desires to control all and enslave humanity to its bidding.

Major Themes

 The dangers of Group Think:

People who love freedom will love this major theme throughout the book. When the trio arrives on Camazotz, they are confronted by a rather odd scene. Everything, and everyone is in sync. They move mechanically, identically. Then, a glitch occurs with a kid who loses control of his ball, and that is when the trio realizes the true danger that they are facing.

The idea that one mind controls all other is terrifying. There is no freedom of thought, individuality, or even faults. In this world where IT has taken over, a nearly perfect dictatorship occurs, where no one can deviate from IT's influence in any way.

 Love conquers all:

As always, love is the answer. Not cutesy love, but deep, selfless, and sacrificial love, which Meg demonstrates when she returns to Camazotz to free her brother Charles from IT's influence.

 Good vs. Evil - Parallels to Christianity:

The theme of good vs. evil is obviously an overarching theme. The Mrs. W's are the forces of good, guiding Meg and the gang through strategies to overcome the forces of evil. However, the guardians cannot defeat the evil themselves and require Meg, her brother, and Calvin to step up in order to overcome evil. References to God and the Bible are prevalent throughout this book and serve as inspirational, motivational, and instructional influences for the characters.

 Interactions of science and faith:

Yes, you read that right. In a world that is constantly trying to prove that these to subjects don't belong in the same realm, L'Engle shows that they do, and they can. Inspired by her studies in quantum physics, she created a science-infused story combined with Christianity.

Overall Feelings

Things that I liked:

 The overall creativity.
 There is room allowed for imagination (the story is not overtold!)
 The meaning and purpose.

Things that I didn't like:

 Megs overall disposition and unlikeability.
 The pacing, and lack of some detail in important areas (as in the world building.)
 Calvin and Megs insta-lovey relationship.

Im glad I took so long to getting around to this review. When I initially finished reading this book, I wasn't blown away by it. However, now that Ive had a lot of time for it to stew, I find that I appreciate it more and more...and more. LEngels perceptiveness of the world is obvious and majorly contributes to the overall awesomeness that A Wrinkle in Time reflects.

I read another of LEngles books last year, Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art where she discusses her artistic expression and how it coincides with her faith. In that book, she talks about her journey (because it took a while to get this series published) with A Wrinkle in Time. Majority of the people who turned her down thought the series was too strange. However, (and I agree with LEngle) I believe its because this book was misunderstood. There is true brilliance behind this concept, that it may just take the freedom of a childs mind to grasp. As adults, our thoughts become adulterated with perceptions that we miss the grander scheme of things. There were times when I was wishing for more detail, then I realized that thats the point: we are supposed to use our imagination when we read. The main reason I gave this book only three and a half stars was because I wasn't a big fan of Meg as the protagonist, and found her quite irritating. Despite that fact, I really enjoyed the overall concept and would recommend this read to anyone.

7487,1122,196,"He was actually reading this for a book study at his church. He was very excited but not everyone shared in his enthusiasm. It is an allegory of the 7deadly sins and our spirits own free will. The characters are as vibrant as the settings as written by someone who I had not read save the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

7488,377,1901,This book was a lot... Its about a man who raped and murdered dozens of people in California in the 1970s and I was hooked and terrified at the same time. The investigation isn't finished and the criminal isn't caught but the author cant be blamed for not trying. Michelle McNamara died in 2016 and the touching afterward by her husband made me cry. It was a creepy and sometimes chill inducing wonderful book that Im glad I picked up!,1520035200,5
7489,767,1901,"Author Gillian Flynn, of GONE GIRL fame, wrote an introduction to Michelle McNamaras true crime book ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK: ONE WOMANS OBSESSIVE SEARCH FOR THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER, which was published posthumously, in which she states about the author: I love reading true crime, but Ive always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone elses tragedy so like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best; writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane. This pretty much sums up why I read and how I select the books that I do about the deep, dark, and twisted behind-the-scenes grit of true crime. My interest is in the writing itself and the research that the writer has put into the book to examine the backstory of a criminal mind. In this case, McNamara did not live to complete her nearly finished story about the Golden State Killer who spread fear and unthinkable crimes up and down the state of California, but her researchers and husband Patton Oswalt put her decade of work together into an astonishing book, an in-depth look at a most horrific series of events.

The subject is a serial rapist and murderer, who committed crimes from the 1970s through 1980s. Police and FBI agents tracked the case from city to city and once DNA testing came to be, it was confirmed that the crimes were in fact all committed by one person, however he still eluded them.

McNamara was determined to understand who he was, to find him. She immersed herself in each case. With each law enforcement officer. They welcomed her. She was one of them. Her research is staggering.

Even if you are used to reading terrifying details that accompany true crime, this is one that you will need to brace yourself for. It is not easy to read. It is haunting. The crimes that the Golden State Killer committed are beyond sadistic, truly the actions of a disturbed mind. There were times that I thought about putting the book down. I wasn't sure I could finish it. It wasn't about what he did that intrigued me, it was about what the author was doing to find him.

That Oswalt lost his wife and was grieving, that their young daughter was left without a mother (he has since recently remarried) but he was able to take his wifes work and put her book out in the world is nothing short of incredible. As he said: I wanted to do right by her.",1520035200,5
7490,12,1897,"I enjoyed reading this historical romance complete with mayhem, spy drama and love. This story has unforgettable characters, sparkling and witty dialogue,was well written, and has  a very happy and satisfying HEA.

The first woman doctor and a spy in Victorian England made for an intriguing read. The story focussed on Garrett and her choices. This is great but at times it was a little too much it made her look insecure instead of strong. I was a little surprised by the bitter attitude Ethan had toward the Ravenels because in the previous books he showed kindness and even protectiveness to Helen and Pandora.",1520035200,4
7491,93,1897,"There really isn't much I can say to express the feeling you get when you open up a Lisa Kleypas book.  Everything around you stops and you are transported to a different place and time.  When I started reading HELLO STRANGER, this was exactly what happened.  I was swept off by these magical words and traveled through time to experience this wonderful story.  Because thats what happens, you experience the magic of her words, not just read them.

Its not just one thing that makes Hello Stranger special.  I can sit here and tell you all about my admiration for the wonderful character that Dr. Garrett Gibson is, because I truly found her inspiring.  And I can wax poetic about my love for Ethan Ransom in and his rugged, intense, manliness.  But theres one thing after the other that just made this my favorite read in the series.

For starters, the research that Ms. Kleypas has done, in both police procedure and the medical profession at the time, comes through in this book more so that in previous ones.  And while that may seem like it can bug down the book with detail and information, it delivers it in a way that just feels so natural.  Which is the perfect way to do so because its just who Garrett is.  I really liked that the author didn't shy away from showing us that side of the story and applaud her for her execution.  It was flawless and interesting.

The plot of this book is full of mystery and intrigue and that is not something Im used to seeing in Lisa Kleypas books to this degree.  But it was ohhh so good!  I just had to know what was going to happen, how where things going to turn out.  And yes, I admit to holding my breath at some points.  What an exciting ride!

Then theres the romance.  Lets not forget that as much as this is about wonderful characters and has an amazing plot, in the end I need to see these characters fall in love.  And the Queen delivered.  I loved every second, every interaction, every word.  I loved how these two completely opposites were attracted to each other.  Their relationship was just as intense as they are as individuals.

If you haven't read this series, then rectify that immediately.  This was my favorite so far and I cant wait for the next one to come.",1520035200,5

After she sees the conditions under which her mother exists and attracts the attention of the mad scientist who is experimenting on her, she becomes determined to find a way to free her mother.

Meanwhile, her own paranormal ability explodes and she needs to go to the Gypsies for training in using or hiding her powers. There she finds out that a boy named Indigo that she met years ago has been taken by the Crows too. She recruits her best friend Khan - a young black man who her father rescued during the Civil War - to help her.

This story is packed with history from the problem with race relations, the problem with organizing labor unions, and the role of women. It takes place in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge which is just being built and is a marvel of its age. It takes place in the grimy and gritty factories where children can be beaten by their supervisors. It adds in magic in Avery's power as an aura seer and a mad scientist who is making a formula to make laborers docile and obedient using the blood of seers.

This is filled with action as Avery and her friends try to free her mother and elude the Crows sent by the scientist to capture her. Once captured, the conditions in the Tombs are horrible but Avery manages to make friends and design a plan to escape.

The main plot point which is freeing her mother is accomplished but there are a number of dangling threads left for a sequel. I thought the story began slowly but, once I got the rhythm, it gained momentum and became a fast paced adventure.",1520035200,4

I divorced Charlie seventeen years ago.  No, wait, eighteen years now.  Eighteen years!  Our divorce is now old enough to vote, or buy a drink at the pub.

How is it that some crimes capture so much public imagination that people  strangers, even  still grieve them decades later?  Its like historic ghost stories.  Most deaths, even terrible ones, get let go of, but occasional ones, for being particularly surprising, ironic, iconic, or grisly, get remembered as spooky tales.

My Review:

The book started with a decades-old cold case murder mystery, which was being pursued again.  The case had gripped the area and nation for a brief time in the 70s after the event and again sixteen years later when a badly decomposed body was found and assumed to be the same missing teenager, although efforts from both previous investigations had been fruitless. There were several overlapping threads in addition to the police case that added to the mystery with intrigue, dead ends, misdirection, secrets, lies; flawed, broken, and vile yet compelling characters; and the ongoing family dramas of the various households of the characters contacted and involved in the case.

This was a slowly developing story and I enjoyed Ms. Winslows unpredictable and densely packed storylines as much as I did the compellingly crafted and flawed characters.  The premise was clever, relevant, and believable while the storylines were complex and multi-leveled, yet well-paced, engaging, and unpredictable.  I had devised and cast aside several theories as I read, all incorrect, every single one of them.  The multifaceted tale was written from multiple POVs, yet I didn't have a problem keeping track as each of the multitudes of characters were distinctly drawn and plucked at my curiosity with a desire to know more.  I would enjoy going backward and reading the previous books in the series although that wasn't necessary to follow this story.",1520035200,4

Graduate student Ledi, who grew up in foster care but is doing just fine, thanks, keeps getting annoying emails claiming she's betrothed to an African prince. Not having anytime for that nonsense, Ledi tries to keep up with her studies and her part-time job all while trying to figure out why her summer fellowship hasn't followed through with her yet.

Well, turns out the Prince is no joke, and his people have finally found Ledi after years of searching.

After travelling to NYC to meet Ledi, Prince Thabiso finds himself mistaken for the new hire at her job. Entranced by Ledi but hoping to get to know her before she realizes he is a Prince, Thabiso keeps up the charade until a disastrous run-in at a charity gala.

Ledi, overwhelmed with the truth of her heritage and Thabiso's lies, still finds herself drawn back to the country of her birth, tasked with helping an expedition discover the root of a terrible disease striking the population.

Funny, brilliantly written, and so sexy, this is a perfect start to a promising new series. I cannot wait for Ledi's BFF Portia's story in A Duke by Default.

7496,816,1897,"Hello, Stranger is a much-anticipated book in the Ravenel series featuring an unconventional heroine and a dark and dangerous hero. I was captivated from the first page to the last, and now I want to read it all over again in audio.

""Beg pardon, miss . . . but why are you a doctor? It's not as if you was a horse face. Why, I know at least two blokes in my division who'd be willing to tied the knot with you... If you could do some cooking and mending, that is.""

Dr. Garret Gibson has been a favorite character of mine since Marrying Winterborne, and I was so excited to see that she was getting her own story. She is such a unique and practical heroine - an educated physician during a time when women in England weren't even allowed to go to medical school. Not only is she educated, she also knows how to take care of herself and doesn't hesitate to wield her walking cane against would-be attackers in the seedy streets of lower-class London. I totally have a girl crush on Garret. At a time when most people thought too much intelligence and learning would cause females to become enfeebled, Garret went above and beyond to live her life as she wished. I loved that she bucked the trend and persevered despite the opinions of society. Garret underwent some personal growth in this book... a transition from the workaholic career woman to one who realizes she doesn't have to sacrifice her professional passion for a personal life.

""A stranger emerged from the shadows, cool darkness spun into the form of a man. He was tall and well-proportioned, his athletic form clad in a plain shirt, gray trousers, and an open vest.""

I just love it when the hero emerges from the shadows! Ethan Ramson (awesome name) was a delicious hero and that imagery of him melting out of the shadows just got to me. Ethan was a detective rising quickly through the ranks of Scotland Yard before he left to carry out dangerous and mysterious work for the Home Office. He is intrigued by our unconventional heroine, and we often finding him following her through the streets of London's underbelly. I felt sorry for Ethan. He was torn between his attraction and respect for Garret, and his own issues regarding his dangerous lifestyle and poor upbringing. I loved seeing Garret coax him out of the shadows.

The pace of this relationship unfolded perfectly with the pace of the storyline and length of the book. There was a good buildup and great chemistry before we got to any intimacy, and the pair absolutely smoldered when they were together. Ethan had some very special abilities that he put to good use to educate our heroine in the amatory arts, so this book got a bit more steamy than I expected.

There was also a nice suspense plot that unfolded with the story and helped advance the plot along. Ethan and Garret made a great team and I liked that he didn't coddle her overmuch in an effort to keep her safe. Secondary characters from the prior books made appearances, including the Ravenel brothers. West Ravenel had a sufficient amount of page time in this installment and it has me excited for his story now. I loved his positive and flippant attitude and am sure to fall in love with the reformed rake... but it will be very tough to top Ethan Ransom.

I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book that I received from the publisher, Avon.",1520035200,5
7497,128,1897,"FINAL DECISION: Not as good as DEVIL IN SPRING, but the unique heroine makes this book. Both outside of the typical aristocratic world, Garrett and Ethan have a sweeter romance than I expected.

THE STORY: Dr. Garrett Gibson is the only woman doctor in England and has made herself independent and finds herself just a little annoyed that Mr. Ethan Ransom keeps popping up watching over her. Ethan was formally with Scotland Yard but now works in the shadows. Although he knows that he should stay away from the intriguing Dr. Gibson, Ethan cannot. Garrett is determined to have a love affair if nothing else, but Ethan brings with him deadly danger from someone plotting a terrorist event.

OPINION: This book has an unlikely pairing -- the first woman doctor in England and a spy. Garrett and Ethan meet periodically as Ethan first comes across her in his work. But even though he knows that there is something special between them, his work does not allow him attachments. He cannot avoid, however, watching over her and the two end up meeting again and again.

A funny way to begin a romance, but Garrett and Ethan bond over strange and practical things. While their meetings are prosaic at times, there is an intense underlying sweetness between them. They are so obviously perfect for one another, but Ethan's job is dangerous and any attachments are dangerous both to him and to anyone he care about. I loved how the two are with one another and how Kleypas keeps the importance of Garrett's job at the forefront of the story.

This is the story of equals. Garrett knows that she wants Ethan and is determined that somehow she will make things work. She has agency in this story. Her choices, her decisions are her own. And she will not allow Ethan to make the decisions for both of them.

With the description of this story, I expected more intrigue and drama, but the book wisely keeps centered on Garrett and her choices and this makes this book more personal and intimate and sweeter as a romance.

WORTH MENTIONING: For fans of West, he has a prominent role here.

CONNECTED BOOKS: HELLO STRANGER is the fourth book in the Ravenels series. While this series has a different couple in each book, this is the story of a family and thus the books have overlapping characters and in this case, the romance between Garrett and Ethan actually begins in MARRYING WINTERBORNE and continues in DEVIL IN SPRING. While this book catches the reader up, I think it is better to read the series in order to know all the characters.

STAR RATING: I give this book 4.5 stars.",1520035200,5

7508,711,1839,"Jack Swyteck, known to readers as a fearless defender of the underdog, challenges a community stunned by the vicious murder of a popular athlete and president of one of the top black fraternities at the University of Florida. Mark Towson, president of an equally prestigious white fraternity, is arrested for the murder based on a tweeted warning to the victim from Towsons phone. The body of Jamal Cousin was discovered bound, gagged and hung from a tree in a nearby swamp, reminiscent of the 1955 lynching of African American teenager Emmett Till. Jack is retained by an old college friend to defend his son in the face of irrefutable evidence.

A DEATH IN LIVE OAK explores themes that pick at the scabs of scars that most Americans hope have faded into history. Strange fruit is used in the threatening text message, which falls on the deaf ears of millennial college kids. None have heard the arcane term, let alone know that it came from a 1930s-era song made famous by Billie Holiday, a name with which they are not familiar. But Jamals death brings back into focus the brutal activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the mid-20th century.

While the campus erupts in violence and the national press descends, Jack is pressed to dig into every exploratory trick in his bag to get to the bottom of a situation that is rapidly growing out of control.

Another era is invoked as an elderly white former socialite reflects on her life and the results of the bigotry that haunt her to her dying days. Grippando skillfully weaves the threads of these history-altering events into a gripping thriller that keeps us guessing straight to the end. And, surprising to this northerner, I was not aware that racially divided Greek houses still exist. I am decades from campus activities and have never lived in the South, so I had to look this up, thinking they were fictional.

James Grippando is an author name I had come across but overlooked. I had no good reason for this; I had just been sticking with my old gang of favorites, too lazy to take a shot at someone new. But after 20+ years of reviewing books, you find that many of these writers are as tired as you are, so you get brave, strike out and look for fresh faces. Sometimes you get lucky. Flipping through Grippandos backlist, I saw that hes been around long enough to have hit the bestseller lists with 13 Jack Swyteck thrillers, as well as several others. I figured he must be worth a look.

Grippando is a well-grounded defense attorney and no stranger to the courtroom that he brings to life on the page. A DEATH IN LIVE OAK is not an endless discourse of courtroom drama, droning on with cross-examinations, objections and gavel-banging judges. Yes, there is a cliffhanger of a trial in the end --- there must be a conclusion --- but we are saved the Perry Mason theatrics. There is much to look forward to for this newcomer. For instance, catching up on the backstory of Jacks fascinating FBI undercover wife and their complicated relationship. So, THE PARDON (the first book in the series), here I come.

7510,711,1837,"THE GATE KEEPER opens with the protagonist, Inspector Ian Rutledge, hurtling down a country road late at night. Earlier that day, he attended the wedding reception for his sister, Frances. Its December 1920, and Rutledge is not working any particular case. That is, until one throws itself at him in horrific fashion.

Rutledge comes upon a motorcar stopped in the middle of the road and a young woman named Elizabeth MacRae. Lying beside the vehicle is the body of her companion, Stephen Wentworth. Elizabeth's story sounds awfully suspicious. Apparently, Wentworth stopped their car when they came upon someone standing in the middle of the road. Elizabeth claims only a few words were exchanged before the strange man pulled out a gun and shot Wentworth to death right in front of her.

Rutledge is already in bad shape as a veteran of World War I who is suffering greatly from what we now know to be PTSD. He is accompanied around the clock by his own companion, the surly Scotsman known as Hamish. Fans of the series will recognize Hamish immediately as a soldier who was killed by Rutledge during the war and now appears as a specter both haunting and guiding Rutledge through every difficult situation in which he finds himself.

When the local authorities arrive at the crime scene, they begin questioning both Elizabeth and Rutledge. Even though Rutledge introduces himself as an Inspector from Scotland Yard, he feels that his interrogation by the local constabulary indicates they have not ruled him out as a suspect. Eventually, he is able to talk himself out of being a suspect and demands that Scotland Yard name him lead investigator in this new case that literally has fallen onto his lap.

Fans of Charles Todds work will smirk when they read scenes that take place between Rutledge and Melinda Crawford, and will instantly recognize the connection to Todds other mystery series that features Bess Crawford. Melinda, who is at the wedding with Rutledge, listens to his story regarding this new case. The investigation has to start with Wentworth and who might have wanted him dead.

Another murder soon takes place, and the victim seemingly has no connection to Wentworth. That is, until Rutledge links them together via the bookstore that Wentworth owned. He had sold a rare book to the second victim that might have been more than just an ordinary novel. It was titled The Gate Keeper, and Rutledge needs to learn what the book meant to the deceased men as well as the individual who killed them over it.

At one point, Rutledge receives a mysterious message referring to Wentworth as a murderer. With no one being who they appear to be on the surface, and a ruthless killer out there ready and willing to take down Rutledge if he stands in his way, this is one case that quickly becomes the deadliest he has ever handled. The answers may lie initially in Wentworth's sordid past, which involved secrets as well as a family that hated him and blamed him for the death of his infant twin brother.

THE GATE KEEPER is unlike anything I have read from Charles Todd. The plot and narrative are put together in such a way that the reader will feel just as disoriented as Rutledge. I have never seen him so out of sorts and clearly suffering greatly from his own internal demons. The ending, which finds Rutledge waiting in an empty house for the murderer to show up, is as tense and suspenseful as anything I've experienced with this series. This is a great opportunity for those unfamiliar with these novels to step right in and enjoy a terrifically written mystery. Loyal readers, meanwhile, are in for a treat as the surprises keep coming right up to the final revelations.

7511,711,1872,"One of the things I especially liked about this terrific novel (and there's a lot to like) is when one of the characters attends a series of classic black and white pictures called Raising Cain. The movies happen to be The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity and Mildred Pierce. Shrewd book and movie lovers will instantly recognize the reference to author James M. Cain, who was probably the father of this type of hard-boiled thriller.

Each of those novels, turned into great movies that garnered countless spinoffs and remakes, involves betrayal and illicit love affairs, and consists primarily of unlikable characters, none of whom can ever be trusted. What a great way to sell Laura Lippman's new work of fiction, SUNBURN, which follows that formula to a tee and makes for an extremely pleasurable reading experience.

Right from the start, we are plunged back into the year 1995. It is on these first few pages that we are introduced to a red-headed lady who now goes by the name Polly Costello. There's a man watching her, and the first thing hes drawn to are her sunburned shoulders. A con woman who is always in her element, she is sitting on a barstool trying to blend in. However, this is a novel filled with con artists, and she will pick up on that fact soon enough.

Polly befriends the barmaid, Cath, at the High-Ho bar in Belleville, Delaware, and quickly finds herself working alongside her. The cook, Adam, takes an instant liking to Polly --- something they both need to keep from Cath. The owner, Mr. C., is just happy that his small group of employees aren't robbing him blind. Early chapters jump to a man named Gregg struggling to raise an infant girl following the babys mother, Pauline, walking out on them. You already may have figured out who Pauline is, but that still will not prepare you for all the twists and turns that this hard-boiled thriller has in store for the reader.

Polly survives by showing little to no emotion when necessary and hardening herself for the difficult decisions she needs to make for both self-preservation and wearing the badge of the con game on her arm at all times. We get to know a little about Polly's past in bits and pieces. At one time she was badly abused by someone named Ditmars, naturally causing her to mistrust all men. It's no wonder she doesn't have her radar working when it turns out that Adam may have interest in her beyond mere carnal knowledge. Could Adam be under the employ of one of Polly's exes? Stay tuned, because it gets far more complicated from here.

Without fail, practically every character in this novel attempts to double-cross or blackmail each other. This will end quickly as those who are more skilled players at this game are sure to come out on top. It seems as if Polly may be attempting not only to hide from her past but also to stow away a nice chunk of change she appropriated along the way. It will be up to you to decide if you think Polly is committed to finally changing and settling down in this sleepy town, or if this is just one more stop on her endless highway to the sky.

Laura Lippman handles the text and subtext of SUNBURN with great ease, and it's apparent she's having a lot of fun with these characters. She is a skilled writer at the top of her own game --- thriller writing --- and this one is a doozy. As much as I enjoy all of Lippmans work, I would love for her to return to where she started out --- with the Tess Monaghan series --- so I could learn how Tess has matured as both a character and a sleuth. After reading SUNBURN, it would be fun to see what nastiness Lippman might cook up for good old Tess!

7512,711,1836,"It is November 1944. Eighteen-year-old June Walker leaves behind her family and their rural life. She and hundreds of other young women head to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which does not even exist on any map. They have been hired to monitor huge machines, the purpose of which is also a mystery. The women are taught how to operate and adjust the various dials, levers and knobs to keep the numbers within certain ranges. Yet they are totally ignorant of the nature and true objective of the mysterious machines that they are in charge of six days a week. The work itself, though critical, is rather boring.

The pay is good, and there is a ready supply of soldiers and civilian employees to occupy the young women during their free time. Oak Ridge operates 24 hours a day because of its top-secret mission. Workers are warned not to speak to anyone about what they see, hear or experience at Oak Ridge. Because no one can really be trusted, this makes conversation even among co-workers a bit tricky. It is difficult to weigh every word that one speaks throughout the course of a day.

Three other characters figure prominently in THE ATOMIC CITY GIRLS. Junes roommate, Cici, has one goal in mind --- to cast off her familys poverty as sharecroppers and marry a wealthy young man. Joe Brewer, a colored construction worker (remember, readers, this book is set in 1944 in the South, and segregation is still a very unpleasant reality), has left his family in Alabama to come to Oak Ridge where he can make decent money. The last important character is a brilliant scientist, Sam Cantor, who heads the department where June works.

Sam is a rather dour figure. Negative and moody, he attempts to medicate his worries with alcohol but is not successful in forgetting the ultimate goal of the work being done, because he knows the secret of Oak Ridge. It is part of the Manhattan Project. Highly critical material created at Oak Ridge is sent to a top-secret facility across the country, where it is being used to create the atomic bomb. Sam, as a physicist, knows too well the awful truth about the utter devastation that will be unleashed if the Manhattan Project succeeds. No wonder he is depressed and trying to drink himself into oblivion! June and Sam carry on an intimate relationship, and bit by bit Sam reveals to June the true mission of Oak Ridge, putting both of them in danger for sharing the protected information.

Though history long ago informed us of the drastic results of the Manhattan Project, it is interesting to read what life was like for the residents and workers at Oak Ridge. And in this day of ubiquitous and ever-invasive communications, it would be difficult to understand how the Manhattan Project actually pulled off its humongous top-secret goal without the thorough research of author Janet Beard.

I loved seeing them together. Both being certain they have no future together and of course, being proven wrong.

Garrett was such an improvement from Pandora, who talked about women's rights but did little for the common good.

Garrett actually acted and tried making the world a better place, she educated women and helped them heal.

She was a nameless Asian woman who taught him the pleasures of the flesh.

What I Liked:

I was expecting to love this book, because it's science fiction, and I adore Rachel Caine's books, and I adore Ann Aguirre's books, and this book sounded really great in general. How awesome is it that these two powerhouse authors collaborated to create this story! Honor Among Thieves was thrilling, shocking, and nail-biting, and I am hooked and ready for more.

This book starts with Zara Cole stealing a rich woman's purse, and some unintended consequences follow. She is hiding from the rich man who is the father of the woman from whom she stole, when she (Zara) is notified that she has been selected to be an Honor. An Honor is a person selected to board a sentient alien ship to explore the universe while working with the ship to help the ship learn more about humans. At first, Zara refuses, but what choice does she have? Becoming an Honor seems safer than waiting for Deluca to hunt her down. But she quickly finds out that being an Honor is infinitely more dangerous than it's made out to be. There is something sinister out in the universe, and Zara may find out about it the hard way.

It took me some to get into this story - maybe the first hundred pages or so. But when Zara is ready to go on the Tour with the alien ship and another Honor (Bea), then I started to get more interested. The first couple of chapters are very necessary to the story, to get a peek into Zara's background and also her desperation to follow the safer path. Once Zara and Bea get started on the tour with the alien ship (Nadim), things start to pick up.

This story relies a lot on secrets and hidden information that Zara is determined to find. The alien ships - called Leviathans - are very secretive and as much as Nadim wants to reveal information to Zara, he can't - not without punishment from the Elder Leviathan. So there is a lot that a reader won't know, because Zara won't know, up until the last few chapters. I was reading intently, trying my best not to peek at the ending (I didn't!), but I really wanted to know some of those secrets! The authors set up the reveals well and I didn't feel clueless or lost throughout the story (in terms of the ""missing"" information that we as readers and Zara are not privy to, until the end).

Zara is such a bada** chick! She is tough as nails and made of iron, from the start. She has had a difficult upbringing and my heart broke for her, over and over. I love how deep her characterization runs (as heartbreaking as her backstory is). In science fiction, you don't always see heroines or heroes with so much depth. Zara has had emotional trauma in her past and it has stuck with her throughout her life. But it has made her stronger; she is so fierce and fearless!

Bea is a secondary character but just as important to the story. Think of her as a copilot - she is the second Honor chosen to be aboard Nadim. Bea is unsure and a little timid at the start, but she really grows into her own fierceness and strength as the story goes on. She becomes a great friend to Zara (and vice versa).

Nadim is the alien ship - yup, he's a ship. But he is made of ""flesh and blood"", like a human, except he is an alien creature that is a ship. He is sentient and what is cool is that Zara can feel him, like an emotional connection, and that is new to him. Nadim is really cool.

This book is a bit of a long one, and it's told in parts. The conflict builds slowly, but the pacing of the story is never too slow. I struggled just a little bit in the beginning, but things really pick up in space, and it wasn't too long before I couldn't turn pages fast enough. The world-building is really cool! I would never have thought about this type of concept (alien ships, Honors, sending humans on Tours and Journeys in the alien ships). Caine and Aguirre have created an intriguing (and sometimes terrifying) world in outer space!

There is technically no romance, though others have mentioned Zara and Nadim as being a romance. They share a very deep emotional connection, which was fascinating to read about. It's pretty cool! It's emotional and not sexual in nature. They are a good match as pilot/ship and work really well together - and their bond is undeniable.

The ending of this book isn't super cliffhanger-y, and I suppose it could end like a standalone would, but I'm glad there will be more books to come (or at least one more, right?). There is a lot out there in space that Zara, Bea, and Nadim haven't encountered, so I'm sure they will be encountering such in the next book(s). I'm ready!

What I Did Not Like:

The only thing worth mentioning on my part is how I had a little bit of a hard time with the beginning of the story - maybe the first hundred pages or so. It was a little slow for me, even if the actual events weren't. If that makes sense? I didn't really get invested until Zara begins her Honor training. But that's okay because the rest of the book really makes up for the slowness of the beginning!

Would I Recommend It:

Any YA science fiction fans out there? You might really enjoy this book. The comparison of ""for fans of Illuminae"" is a good one. Anyone who likes that series would enjoy this book. And with such a talented duo behind Honor Among Thieves, it's no surprise that this book could be compared to Illuminae (also written by an incredible duo). Even if you're not into YA science fiction, this might be a thrilling ride for you! It's science-y but not too specifically science-y, which is good for non-science-y readers.

7518,567,1892,"I devoured this book!

Jack and Sophie's story was so much fun to read--the first half, when they make their wager and spend time together, is the strongest part of the story, though the HEA was satisfying as well. Watching them initially clash but then gradually grow to like and respect each other was delightful--seeing how Jack's demeanor changed from cold and proper to warm and relaxed, especially through Sophie's eyes, was wonderful. The second half, where they're back in London and trying to hide their relationship from everyone is slightly more problematic (neither one of them worries about unintended consequences? Not once? Hardly seems in character for either of them...) and their dark moment felt not quite in character either, especially for Sophie. Still, Jack knows when to bring out the big guns, and did I mention the HEA was nicely done? ;)

My Once and Future Duke is the start of a new series for Ms. Linden (The Wagers of Sin), so it's a great place to start if you've never read her books before. (Though Jack does get some help from an earlier Linden character, the hero in What a Gentleman Wants ; now I definitely need to read his book too...) Quick warning, though--the epilogue contains a major teaser for the next book in the series ( An Earl Like You --I had it on my TBR before I was even halfway done with this one) which is going to make waiting for it to come out twice as difficult... ;)

7519,731,1893,"I expected to like this book, but I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. If Star Wars and Pirates and Anastasia got together and made a book baby it would be this book. It established such an interesting world and had a FANTASTIC cast of characters. I seriously loved every single character and with each new chapter I changed my mind on who my favorite was.

I think my favorite thing about this book is we have two main characters and their arc is not to fall in love; they each have their own separate love interests and I just cannot get over how much I loved this and how different it was. And the cast of secondary characters was also fantastic. I loved them all; even the ones I didn't get to know that well.

Our main heroine Ana is fierce and fearless and willing to fight for what she loves and believes in. Robb comes from a privileged life but he has constantly let his family down and he just wants to be able to be himself. Jax. Oh how I loved Jax. He is an interesting one and I won't give away his secrets, but I loved him and all the secrets surrounding him. If I HAD to pick a favorite it would probably be him. Then there is D09 or as his friends call him, Di. Di is a Metal and was like a combination of C3PO and K-2SO and I loved him too. These are the main four but I cant forget to mention Siege and E0S and the rest of the crew because they too were great.

Aside from the characters, I also loved the plot. I mean we all know the Anastasia story so there is some predictability there, but there was enough originality to the story that it kept me engaged and on edge. The sci fi aspect was great and I really liked the world building. That ending hurt my heart and I swear we better get a sequel or I will riot.

Heart Of Iron was such a great read and it kinda took me by surprise. I really recommend this one.",1520121600,5

Moonlight Sins by Jennifer L. Armentrout
Book One of the de Vincent series
Publisher: Avon
Publication Date: January 30, 2018
Rating: 3 stars
Source: eARC from Edelweiss

Summary (from Goodreads):

Julia Hughes has always played it safe until she learned a very painful lesson. Now Julias starting over with a job in the Louisiana bayouand a scorching encounter with a stranger, only to discover hes Lucian de Vincent . . . her new employer. The de Vincent brothers share a massive fortune and a dark reputation. Julia cares for their troubled sister, but a menacing presence in the mansionand the ever-present temptation of Lucianprove dangerously distracting.

Lucians grandmother claimed de Vincent men fall in love onceand hard. Apparently, its Lucians turn. Julias compassionate care of his twin makes Lucian want to lay himself bare. But some secrets are better for Julia not to know.

The recent suicide of Lucians father is the latest in a string of deaths on the estate. Someone is eliminating the de Vincents. And the best way to get to Lucian may be through Julia. . . .

What I Liked:

I had high hopes for this book, because (1) it's a JLA book, and she's a great storyteller, and (2) the whole New Orleans/Gothic vibe really pulled me in. I love stories involving the heroine living in the same house as the hero (like this case, in which Julia is hired as a live-in nurse, or historical romance novels in which the heroine is a governess or chaperone, or whatever). So I excited to like this book a lot. In the end, I felt kind of meh about it. I have no doubt that fans of JLA will enjoy the book. For me, I just didn't love it.

Julia is a sweet, caring young woman in her late twenties, looking for a fresh start. She's leaving her job as a nurse to move to Louisiana and work as a live-in nurse, caring for a young woman in a near-coma. But Julia doesn't know that the young woman is Madeline de Vincent, and that the family hiring her is the notorious de Vincent family. Three brothers live in the de Vincent mansion - Devlin, Gabriel, and Lucian. There is something strange about the house, and there is something even stranger about the brothers. No matter how she tries, she can't get Lucian from under her skin. Lucian would do anything for his twin sister Maddie, including allowing a nurse to live in the mansion and become privy to the de Vincent secrets. But he doesn't plan on falling for her. His feelings for her put her in danger, something neither of them realize until it is too late.

For the most part, I liked Julia. She is different from JLA's repetitive heroines, who are usually spitfire spunky girls who are always looking for a fight. Nothing wrong with those types, but it seems like ALL of JLA's heroines are like that. Julia is actually very sweet and caring, and takes her job as a nurse very seriously. I liked how resolute and determined she was to treat Maddie as best as possible, and how she tried to keep things professional between her and Lucian. Julia, for the most part, is very smart, and I loved her sweetness and near-docility. Her strength is quiet and smooth, not loud.

Lucian is such a flirt, and a charming, swoony one at that. He has his own emotional baggage, including his relationship with his father, his tense relationship with the eldest de Vincent (Devlin), and all that he has done to protect the de Vincent family. I liked Lucian even though he's such a flirt - he is very honest and open about what he wants, so you can't even really fault him for being a flirt.

The mystery/suspense part of the story deals with the murder (but apparent suicide) of the de Vincent patriarch (the brothers' father), which happened right around the time Maddie shows up, lying face-first in the family's pool. Maddie is unresponsive and barely moves, but something strange is going on, and it has to do with her reappearance, after ten years of absence. Sometimes the suspense was intriguing, other times it was boring.

The romance started off really lusty and eventually progressed to deeper feelings. I liked the chemistry between Lucian and Julia and also liked how they fit together as a couple, beyond the sexy times. They circled each other for nearly the entire book but it was gratifying to see them finally get together. They had good chemistry!

I didn't really care about the other two brothers, though I'm curious to see if Devlin will crack under his perfect, cold facade. Gabe got on my nerves and I don't really care to read his book (the next one, Moonlight Seduction). But I did like the bond between the three brothers, tense as things were.

Overall, the book wasn't bad, but I have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth after finishing the book, like something didn't settle right with me. There were a couple things that I didn't care for, minor as they might seem.

What I Did Not Like:

I just can't shake the ""meh"" feeling I have for this book. Like it was an okay read but 10/10 would not reread, that sort of thing. At times I was intrigued, other times I was bored. The beginning was somewhat boring, and then it got interesting, and then it got boring again, and you get the idea.

The middle 40% of the book is kind of a drought in terms of sexy times, so that might have factored into things. Maybe the other should have spread things out, in terms of the sexy times. Also I kept seeing people say how this book was sooooooo hot. It really wasn't? I mean it was pretty hot but not scorching hot? I think my expectations, in that regard, were too high.

I really could have done without Gabe's initial interest in Julia. Seriously? It wasn't the formation of a love triangle, thank goodness, but the author could have dropped that part, especially since it clearly went nowhere. I h a t e when there is any hint of anything when it involves brothers, so that didn't need to be in the story at all. When Julia meets Gabe for the first time? Unnecessary. Other interactions? Unnecessary. Again, no love triangle, no messiness, but it just felt unnecessary, especially since Julia had no feelings or attraction towards him.

It's amazing how a heroine who is supposedly not super attractive, somehow attracts aaaaallllll the hot men in town. Good for Devlin for being a cold-hearted bastard with no interest in Julia.

The climax and ending felt really rushed. I completely expected the ending, actually from the moment a key character was introduced I knew what was going on, and yet I still had a hard time keeping track of what was going on in the end. There was a lot to sort through. Also? There was that cliche thing in which the villain took the time to explain everything to the hero/heroine. Does this ever actually happen in real life? I highly doubt it. This is a pet peeve that seriously bothers me.

Would I Recommend It:

If you're a fan of JLA's adult work then it's fair to give this book a shot - especially since the ""meh"" feeling that I have could very well just be me. I wanted to fall in love with this book and also be seriously creeped out and chilled by the Gothic setting and curses and hauntings and whatnot. Mostly I was just annoyed with Julia for not jumping Lucian's bones, and for Gabe not leaving everyone alone (he's so annoying), and for everyone not waking up and seeing what was in front of them. Also don't read this book if even a shred or hint of love triangles mess with you. There isn't a love triangle but it still bothered me (Gabe's interest in Julia).

Rating:

3 stars. I do not think I will be reading Moonlight Seduction, especially since Gabe's story now has a trope that I do not like (feel free to contact me if you want to know more). Don't get me wrong! These books can be read as standalone novels and this trope I mention has nothing to do with Lucian and Julia. If book three focuses on Devlin, then I will probably read book three! But not book two.",1520121600,3
7521,711,1911,"With todays newscasts focused on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, IN THE ENEMYS HOUSE is a timely release. Author Howard Blum, who was twice nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, tells the true story of two counterintelligence agents working to arrest members of a Russian spy ring after World War II. The Cold War years following 1946 were dangerous times for espionage agents in both the United States and Russia. Although by todays standards their methods were crude, Bob Lamphere and Meredith Gardner managed to crack seriously encrypted Russian codes dating back to wartime. Gardner was a highly specialized linguist and code breaker, and Lamphere was an FBI supervisor.

Hard-driving FBI director Herbert Hoover expected his agents to produce results, no matter the difficulty. Lamphere had worked in Alabama, transferred to the New York office, and was relatively happy bringing draft dodgers to justice. A tall, handsome young agent, he displayed his grit when he won an armed standoff in Chinatown. Instead of feeling rewarded for his bravery, Lamphere looked upon his new assignment to the Soviet Espionage squad as banishment to Siberia. After all, Russia had been our ally in the war.

Recently declassified counterintelligence documents provided Blum with material for his detailed research. The reader identifies with the two agents, applauding their dual successes and empathizing with them when they are frustrated. Reading like a novel, IN THE ENEMYS HOUSE captures the personalities of both men, giving one a first-hand and side-by-side experience. Blum drops in enough detail within decoded transmissions that we can follow code-name changes for the Russian agents when they feel threatened. Code words from wartime documents became items to break when suspicions revealed realities that Russian agents had been operating on American soil for many years.

Gardner worked endless hours at his cubicle in the former college for women, now known as Arlington Hall. Lamphere felt his career in the FBI was waning, but tried to convince himself that there was a greater purpose to his busywork. A challenge to both men occurred when an American socialite, Elizabeth Bentley, became an avid communist. A confidential notification reached the FBI offices that an American was infiltrating specialized classified information and passing it on to the Russian KGB. Bentley had decided that communism had failed her and was now on a hit list. Her interview with the New Jersey FBI filtered to Lampheres desk, giving him a sudden new lease on his job. Some of the coded material had been created in Cyrillic, which was unknown to most agents. He was directed to the Arlington campus where he and Gardner became fast allies in a new war with Russia. Both realized that the enemy was far ahead of U.S. intelligence, and they must counterattack with a vengeance.

Gardners stockpile of manuscripts dated back to the middle days of the war --- a time-consuming task. Together, the two unlikely partners became dogged sleuths searching for answers to unfolding questions. They complemented one another in style and determination to the job at hand. Decoded messages revealed that the Russians had been actively stealing American secrets regarding the Manhattan Project, the quest to build an atomic bomb. When it became apparent that America had indeed manufactured and tested such a bomb, the Russians made immediate plans to activate Arzamas-16, a secret facility 400 miles east of Moscow, in order to build their own bomb.

Meanwhile, Lamphere and Gardner had decided to fan out FBI agents to interview the scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project. One British scientist felt the heat and turned himself in to British authorities. The spy, Klaus Fuchs, spilled that he had given his Russian handler information about the newest powerful bomb, which contained plutonium. While at Los Alamos, Fuchs had passed documents to a man known only as Raymond. Lamphere and Gardner felt confident that they could identify the Russian handler, opening the door to reeling in a great number of spies.

In what became known as the first and most acclaimed federal case against a spy ring, Julius Rosenberg, his wife, Ethel, numerous relatives and former classmates at a local college were proven enemies of the United States. In retrospect, Lamphere and Gardner knew that their partnership had uncovered secrets many did not believe existed. On the day that the Rosenberg couple was executed, both men experienced relief but sadness as well; neither could justify Ethels death.

IN THE ENEMYS HOUSE is a page-turning treatment of a tremendous Cold War exploit, its resolution and aftermath.

7522,711,1906,"As the whole world knows, when Hollywood was filming Glengarry Glen Ross, there was a concern that the stage play wasn't long enough to be a decent screenplay. So David Mamet added a scene to the screenplay, the famous scene where Alec Baldwin stomps into the story for a few minutes and berates the salesmen who aren't Al Pacino. Coffee is for closers, he shouts. Always be closing. And, this being a Mamet project, a few words that I cant include on a family book review website.

This is snappy dialogue, you understand, and Glengarry Glen Ross and Mamets other films are chockful of it. In the Millers Crossing screenplay, Joel and Ethan Coen note that the snappy dialogue tends to dry up once a guy starts soiling his union suit, but thats never been a problem in Mamets universe. And CHICAGO, God bless it, is a veritable fountain of snappy dialogue, flowing from his pen as from a dark and corrupted stream.

The reader may come to this novel expecting a story, and said reader will not be overly disappointed. The protagonist, Mike Hodge, is a scrappy Chicago Tribune reporter in the age of Al Capone, a veteran of World War I air battles, and hangs out in disreputable bars and reputable whorehouses. Its a mans life in a mans world, and Hodge makes his lonely way through it until he is surprised by love --- and then devastated by its loss.

That is the story, such as it is, a sad tale of loss and revenge, and it hardly matters. CHICAGO is not a typical historical mystery; it is more about human motivations than solving a crime. And it doesnt rely a great deal on crime-solving technique; Hodge spends most of his investigation bumbling around, following up on leads, waiting for people to explain what is really going on. And none of it matters.

Despite its evocative cover of a gangster with a Thompson gun, CHICAGO is high-grade literary fiction, more about characters and worldviews than crime and corruption. More pearls of wisdom flash by than bullets. And if the wisdom is hard-edged, bitter and cynical, perhaps all the better.

The real question that the book has to address from a marketing perspective is whether or not it will be able to win readership from outside of Mamets fan base. I have followed his career ever since a college professor recommended House of Games, which is a fantastic character study wrapped around a deeply twisty and satisfying story. But if you're not in the market for rapid-fire profane dialogue, will you be won over?

It is something of a close question, but the answer is probably not. The difficulty in dealing with CHICAGO as a reading experience is not so much with Hodge, but with the people he talks to. There is another reporter who is more or less his mirror image, an African-American madam in a comfortable brothel, and a collection of crooked cops and honest gangsters. There isn't a character in the book outside of Hodge who couldn't be filled by Central Casting without a moments consideration. (And I kept hearing Hodges voice in the same Irish lilt that Gabriel Byrne used in the aforementioned Millers Crossing, if that gives you an idea.) And the characters generally play true to type; there isn't one moment when any of them surprise you, or themselves.

But neither the story nor the characters are the real point. The real point is Mamet himself, his skill, his ability to wring evocative prose out of the overworked, sterile soil of the hard-boiled crime novel. His understanding of the way people speak to each other, when to deliver the smart retort or the impassioned diatribe. This is a novel of big-shouldered conversations, the rough and tumble of speech, what people say and do not say, and how it all works together.

Hodges fellow reporter remarks at one point that he has stopped reading a certain author because of stark, staring envy at the writers prowess. This book evokes those same feelings for anyone who tries to write dialogue --- making it a teeth-grinding experience for some. But for the rest of us, who revel in snappy dialogue, CHICAGO is an unalloyed joy.

7523,711,1835,"THE HOUSE OF IMPOSSIBLE BEAUTIES by debut novelist Joseph Cassara makes a grand entrance with Angel. She resides in the Bronx with her mother and younger brother Miguel, who has a heart of gold but a bad habit of selling drugs. While Miguel distracts their mother, Angel sneaks into the apartment during the early morning hours, creeps into the bedroom and changes out of her lady clothes, a slick silver dress that turns heads, and looks at the boy staring back at her. Angel's mother would later say, ""My son is shot dead, and you're over here playing dress up.""

Angel's mother has a few words for her when she brings Hector over to the apartment, a Martha Graham dancer with an intellect that will sweep you off your feet. Mami and Hector get along fabulously; it's just that AIDS is hitting the city hard, and Angel's mother would rather call a Santera to stop death in its tracks. Throughout this fierce novel that's splashed with glitter and heartache, Angel mourns the loss of her true love. She remembers the time they strutted into Bloomingdales. Hector wanted to buy Angel a Chanel suit, but came up short at the register. These are the parts of the book that show how much heart these characters have, and how much they want to give one another.

Cassaras novel shines when it displays the generosity of friends and lovers who form their own family, and soon their very own House of Xtravaganza. As Hector once said, their house is ""a community of runaway boriqua queens."" But they move from Alphabet City to the boogie-down Bronx so Angel can escape the ghost of him.

THE HOUSE OF IMPOSSIBLE BEAUTIES is set in the '80s, at the height of the Harlem drag ball scene. Angel finds a mentor in Dorian, who is the queen of that very scene; she's like a fairy godmother, protecting those who pass through, those who pique her interest.

Angel supports herself and her adopted family by working at Pathmark. She doesn't do welfare lines because ""If it can't be done in heels, she didn't want to do it."" She's a mother to Daniel and Juanito, who fall in love, and to Venus.

Venus is Italian and Puerto Rican, and as a young boy, life in Jersey was nothing but a tragedy. As Thomas, her Nonna was the town's godfather. Her mother's number-running boyfriend, Antonio, pretended to have a wife so he did not have to marry her. Thomas was the only person who caught on. When his mother and Nonna went to jail, Thomas was smart enough to get away from Antonio and start a new life with a new name, Venus: ""like the planet,"" she says. Venus is the most complex and broken character in this story.

Estranged from her family, Venus is sexually assaulted in a bathroom by her friend's man and abandoned again, until Angel catches her squatting and crying. Like the guardian angel she is, Angel scoops Venus up and beats the living hell out of that nasty man. But Venus' future continues to be filled with ups and downs as she navigates the ball scene. Street life and cruising for a buck take a toll on her. Then there are the rules: Don't mix business and pleasure. Don't fall for a customer. Venus breaks all those rules, which breaks her, and causes her to spiral out of control, breaking the hearts of those who love her --- Angel, Daniel and Juanito.

THE HOUSE OF IMPOSSIBLE BEAUTIES is written from multiple perspectives. Each character has suffered the loss of someone, something, or a dream at the edge of his or her reach. Yet what brings these dynamic and memorable people together is love, and the House of Xtravaganza, a home to those who don't have one, a place where all are treated like the royalty they are, and with love and loyalty --- major themes in this great breakout book by Joseph Cassara.

I've been dying to read this book since the episode of Smart Podcasts, Trashy Books where author Alyssa Cole talked about creating the gorgeous cover for this book (and of course, gave teasers for the book itself), and am happy to report that it did not disappoint! I loved Ledi and the fact that she is a graduate student in epidemiology--and that she actually does epidemiology-type-stuff throughout the book. Gotta love dedicated, brainy heroines, amirite? :) And (Prince) Thabiso? OMG, that first trip to a bodega--and on the subway--had me giggling. And don't even get me started on his adorableness and princely behavior throughout (checking Ledi for consent whenever things heat up *almost* makes up for the whole pretending-to-be-Jamal thing).

The mysterious illness/villain portion of the story wasn't the strongest--it wasn't too hard to guess who the ""bad guy"" was, their motivation, or even (at least a basic idea of) how they were attempting to accomplish their goals. Still, the romance between Thabiso and Ledi more than made up for any weakness that might have existed in other parts of the story.

This modern twist on Cinderella was a great start to Ms. Cole's new series, Reluctant Royals, and I can't wait for book two! Portia wasn't my favorite character throughout much of the book--she's got some major issues to work through--but I'm looking forward to seeing how Ms. Cole will make her a more sympathetic character.

7528,527,440,"As is usually the case with Russian literature, The Brothers Karamazov is a daunting read. These thick tomes are usually on lists of books you should read, but picking up such a large volume and consuming its contents can be quite intimidating. Even the audiobook version (which I used for this review) clocks in at almost a full work-week of listening to get through it all. Still, those who manage to take on this herculean task are likely to be rewarded with an engaging story that covers a wide variety of topics to include (but not limited to) religion, marriage, communism, fatherhood, and (of course) brotherhood.

Having already read Dostoyevskys Crime and Punishment , I found The Brothers Karamazov to be more along the lines of Law & Order. His former book was a tight and well-paced examination of guilt, even in the face of necessity and wealth distribution. The Brothers Karamazov, however, took a while to set everything up in order to provide an engaging examination of a murder. The first third of this book seemed to be a little bloated with details that never really panned out, but once the real action sets in, get ready for an exciting philosophical ride.

Of course, The Brothers Karamazov is mostly a vehicle for Dostoyevsky to explore some fundamental ideas. These ideas permeate the human condition so thoroughly that he can ask the hard questions in a natural and realistic context. Through conversations with the Devil, as well as arguments in court, Dostoyevsky invites the reader to consider what true fatherhood really is.

7530,331,187,"We use this for my son (who is in kindergarten).

I have to say that the book has a couple of problems, in spite of being good overall.

1. It's a little bit too long.
2. They have a lot of things that are actually very inappropriate grammar, but rhyme.
3. They actually have the expression ""hither and yon"" in the book. We know that, but how many people actually use those words?

On the good side though is the beautiful illustrations and the rhythm of the rhyme scheme.

Verdict: Recommended at the second hand price.",1520121600,4
7531,1071,296,"I just reread this with my nephew - a buddy read. I was reminded how much I loved this book years ago, and again I'm glad to return to a classic with my older self. I guess they teach this in schools because it's a short and deceptively simple story that young readers certainly can read. Whether I was able to understand the many facets here is a completely different question. For my adult self, this one left me aching and questioning ethics and morals and what, exactly, does ""right or wrong"" mean? Lenny is one of the most endearing figures I've ever read. George can seem so brilliant in comparison, but he is also just a simple guy, doing his level best to do right in a very complex and difficult situation. Both men steal my heart.

7533,379,1073,"This paperback edition of Christina Baker Kline's, ""A Piece of the World"", is packed with ""extras""! There is an Afterward with fascinating details of how Kline chose this subject: ""Christina's World"" painting by American artist Andrew Wyeth, how she researched her subjects, and what is fact and what is fiction. There is a color picture of Wyeth's masterwork, an cozy author interview with the author by bestselling author, Kristin Hannah (""The Great Alone"" - see my review), a Reader's Guide, and a bonus story. All that at the end of an engrossing, beautifully described and perfectly paced novel about Christina Olson, the model for Wyeth's most famous work.

In the end Christina says, ""The older I get, the more I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance."" Yes indeed.

ANOTHER BONUS: there are some fabulous videos on YouTube describing the painting ""Christina's World"", along with several videos that will take you on a tour of the Olson House and grounds highlighting the spectacular setting. If I'd known about these I would have watched them BEFORE I started reading to enhance Kline's wonderful, and accurate, descriptions.",1520121600,4
7534,88,126,"As a child the 1939 film of The Wizard of Oz meant a great deal to me. Not only does it stand the test of time, you can watch it over and over again without getting even slightly bored. If that weren't impressive enough I find that with each new viewing I find some hidden gem I'd never noticed before which makes it continually exciting.

A few weeks ago I caught the film on TCM and it occurred to me that all this time it meant so much to me I'd never bothered to actually read the book and set out to remedy this immediately. It's no surprise the book is special since from it came such a classic film. It was most interesting to see all the things they changed, or added to the story to make it all the more magical. I knew of course they wouldn't be bursting into song in every chapter but I was surprised at how little detail Baum gave to Oz. A lot of my favourite things about Oz were missing in the book. But the story is there and Baum's work certainly did a lot to help the Fantasy genre become what it is today.

I'm definitely curious to read the others in the series as well as the newer interpretation Wicked.

7537,121,1699,"Cole's futuristic sci-fi will delight those who loved Avatar (and not for the 3D). It delves into human greed, arrogance and has themes of colonialism. The story is set in a distant planet called Faloiv, where a community of human settlers, mostly scientists get stranded, and is told from the point of view of a second generation settler, Octavia. Octavia and her generation have been brought up to revere scientific advancement, and the main aim of the colony seems, at first, to study the indigenous flora and fauna of this planet. As the story goes on, the darker aspirations of a faction of the first generation comes to light, and it also brings up how humans will feel entitled to things.

The human colony on Faloiv seems to be very into clean living and conservation - part of it is because how the native Faloii had imposed certain rules for living on their planet, in exchange for allowing the humans to settle on a pocket of land and study the animals and plants around them. Octavia, brought up in this way, loves scientific exploration and is competitive and determined. Her relationship with her father, however, starts to deteriorate when he starts acting odd, and she starts to search out why. Meanwhile, the scientists kids are being allowed, for the first time, into laboratories for actual research, and contact with the Faloii animals seems to allow her to, ahem, *spoilers* understand them on a deeper level.

The world of Faloiv was pretty interesting, even if we only see the small human colonies that study them. The description of the alien (for humans) plants and animals, as well as the unique method of communication between them is certainly a bit inspired from Avatar. Visually, it is an imaginative novel world, and the author has taken care to make it diverse, too. Most of the humans described are coded as POC, and even though human race isn't a dividing factor on the human colonies, it is nice to have a STEM black girl as the main character, along with many secondary characters also being POC. On sexuality, too, it frequently mentions having gay parents or bi/pan characters. Additionally, there is consideration given to animal cruelty in science, and how we should understand the pain and feelings of animals better.

The main conflict of the story is the otherness the people develop even when living as immigrants on another planet, and how quick it is to encourage humanity's worst impulses. Respect for another culture, especially one that is allowing you to peacefully assimilate, as well as clinging to traditions is also juxtaposed within the younger generation. They are the ones who didn't know life on any other planet than the one they were born on, so their loyalty and love is to Faloiv, but for Octavia, it is also her parents who have opposing views on how humanity should behave in Faloiv. The only downside to this book was that in developing so much of the world, it could only have one main storyline with a little time aside for ushering us towards the next book. It felt more like a build-up, and with the slow pace, not much of a layered story.

Overall, it is a good start to the series, and has a beautifully constructed world, and brings up some interesting themes.

7539,517,336,"Complex, tense, and chilling, SINCE WE FELL is more action and less psych suspense with flawed characters on the search for identity.

I wanted to love this book, oh how I wanted to love it. But for me, this one just sort of fell flat. Part of what drew me to the story of course, is Dennis Lehane. The guy can write, hands down. I had enjoyed his other books, mostly SHUTTER ISLAND, but I found SINCE WE FELL a bit pedantic. It was as though he started out writing something else altogether (a young woman searching for her birth father following her narcissistic psychology professors mother's death) and melded it with something more higher-stakes and action-thriller-y than I anticipated. It could have been his design all a long, but for me, the reading experience was too bifurcated and then I had difficulty keeping the threads in the second half (last third?) straight.

Lehane is gifted at character study and this is what I loved about the book. In fact, there's much to like about his descriptions of Rachel Childs, her mother, the supporting cast of characters. I felt things took a strange turn when she was called to cover a Haitian earthquake as a reporter (in this sense, it went a little 'Homeland' ala Clare Danes) and Rachel has her 'mental breakdown' (which was more like a small stroke in air). I wanted more of that breakdown and I felt it was kind of glazed over (or maybe I was falling asleep). What results is Rachel being a sort of shut-in.

And then we are taken on a jolting, twisting ride filled with potholes of lies and twisted characters. Others will like this book, it just wasn't what I was expecting. It will appeal to those who like Robert Ludlum, Lee Child, Ken Follet, Steig Larsson, etc. But for me, it was just a little too edgy, a little too gritty and action-driven.",1520208000,3
7540,924,138,"The plot and characters in this novel are fun, while there is a serious undercurrent. The most compelling aspect of this novel is the interrelationship among characters.

What seemed to be a lighthearted look at two sisters and how different they and their lives are, grew into a more serious social commentary.

7542,651,902,"The Jane Austen Project is the perfect mix of sci-fi, Austen tribute and historical fiction. Its unique in that Ive never come across an Austen sci-fi (if there are others out there, point me in their direction!)  Ive read modern adaptations and paranormal ones, but nothing that comes close to this!

In a future where meat is non-existent after some sort of disaster referred to as The Collapse, most things are 3-d printed, and time travel is a fairly common occurrence, theres a group of people who are desperate to get Austens letters to her sister Cassandra (most of which were actually burned after Austens death) and her last, unfinished manuscript, The Watsons. At first I was highly confused as to why this mission was a priority  don't get me wrong, I love Austen and would love to read anything and everything by her, yet this seemed a bit frivolous. However, towards the end of the book and after some wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey happenings, it makes sense. Actually, maybe it makes sense before then and I just missed it.

All the characters are well done. Liam and Rachel have been extensively trained in order to successfully blend in during 1815, yet, understandably there are some tough times. No amount of acting classes and training scenarios can compare you for spontaneous human interaction. They are both doing their best to complete their mission while also internally fan-girling (or guy-ing) at being surrounded by Austen and her family. Theres also the added layer of their personalities being subtly similar to those of Lizzy and Darcy.

Jane Austen herself is just what Id imagine shed be like, from my limited readings about her life. Her brother Henry was my favorite of the Austen clan, however. Hes a gentleman, but unlike those in Austens novels, we get to see his more, realisticer, manly side. Basically, hes horny and flirty, ok? I was loving it! He falls somewhere in between the practiced manners of Bingley (or maybe even Tilney because of his sense of humor) and the saucy, flirtatiousness of Wickham and Willoughby.

Speaking of flirtatiousness, this book had more steamy scenes than I expected. In fact, I didn't expect any steamy scenes! Henry isn't the only one trying to heat things up. I was pleasantly surprised to find a few sexy times thrown in. You guys might be familiar with how I always harp on about Austen not letting her characters kiss. Little did I know how satisfying scenes that go beyond that would be! Scandalous!

The plot had me guessing what would happen up until the actual last page of the book. I was practically jumping out of my skin because the ending was going to decide whether I was going to give the book five stars or toss it out the window while swearing. Granted, I still would have recommended the book, had the ending gone differently, but it really would have dampened my satisfaction with the story up until that point.

If you like Austen adaptations, historical fiction and time travel then I highly recommend The Jane Austen Project! It gives off low key Austenland vibes (except way more intense because the characters are living the real damn deal) with a hint of Dark Matter (multiple realities) and Im now declaring historical sci-fi to be my new favorite totally made up genre. I sincerely hope Flynn puts out another book soon (and I hope its in the same universe  I have ideas!)",1520208000,5

Synopsis: Kate Harker and August Flynn are the heirs to a divided citya city where the violence has begun to breed actual monsters. All Kate wants is to be as ruthless as her father, who lets the monsters roam free and makes the humans pay for his protection. All August wants is to be human, as good-hearted as his own father, to play a bigger role in protecting the innocentbut hes one of the monsters. One who can steal a soul with a simple strain of music. When the chance arises to keep an eye on Kate, whos just been kicked out of her sixth boarding school and returned home, August jumps at it. But Kate discovers Augusts secret, and after a failed assassination attempt the pair must flee for their lives. InThis Savage Song, Victoria Schwab creates a gritty, seething metropolis, one worthy of being compared to Gotham and to the four versions of London in her critically acclaimed fantasy for adults,A Darker Shade of Magic. Her heroes will face monsters intent on destroying them from every sideincluding the monsters within.

I will admit that I love Romeo and Juliet. Its always been my weak spot and I enjoy reading spin-offs of the story. One of my favorites is now This Savage Song. While not directly a Romeo and Juliet retelling, you can tell there are many borrowed references. The book, however, is nothing short of unique and wonderful in its own right. The character development is marvelous and the world building is as well. The plot kept me intrigued throughout the book and the pacing was marvelous for the book. And the best thing about this book is how the monsters are incorporated and created and how music is incorporated as well.

However, I just wish that this book had went more into the other cities and countries around Verity, but it looks like book 2 will do that so Im excited! Definitely a must read for me!

Verdict: I just want to talk more about this book, but its something you should experience blind. Go into it. Dont read anymore reviews. Experience it, feel it, and enjoy.",1520208000,5
7545,145,914,"If you are looking for a book that explains how or why Van Halen wrote their songs or goes into great detail about how they found each other, this book isn't it.  It mainly focuses on their touring time until David Lee Roth leaves the band.  Noel E. Monk first met Van Halen when he acted as their tour manager for their first tour promoting an EP of songs that were playing on the radio, including ""Runnin' With the Devil"", ""Eruption"", ""Ice Cream Man"", ""You Really Got Me"", and ""Jamie's Cryin'"" that would eventually become the album Van Halen with other songs added.  The year was 1978.  Noel will adhere that he knew the band was something special and on the cusp of making it huge.

Their band manager, Marshall Berle had been chosen for them by the record company and he was lousy. He was never there and he charged them for everything.  He once put on a lavish party for them and then stuck them with the gigantic check, which also included his flight out there for him and his wife and his hotel stay.  Berle also filmed the band constantly whenever he was around doing all sorts of things, including sexual acts.  The breaking point between the band and Berle came when he showed these tapes to the brass and the female secretaries back at Warner recording studios.

While on the road for that tour, the guys, especially David Lee Roth, who was the de facto leader of the band and loved to deal with the business end of things spent a great deal of time talking to Noel about things he should have been discussing with his manager, but Noel helped him out and gave him the information he needed.  So at the end of the tour, David came to him and said that he and the guys wanted Noel to by their manager.  Noel told him that he wanted the job but that first they should go to some of the heavy hitters first and see what they could do for them since he had no experience as a band manager especially for a band that was breaking big.

They did and they still wanted Noel.  However, their lawyer would insist that Noel sign a month to month contract instead of a multi-year contract which is standard in the industry.  The guys were naturally gunshy after their last manager and Noel felt pressure to do it this way and figured he could always talk them into a real contract later. This would never happen.  And in a way, this led to him having an ax to grind with this book because Van Halen did kinda screw him over if his version of events is to be believed.  On their first tour, each was paid $175 dollars a concert even though their songs were getting great airplay and people were packing in the concert halls to see them.  They were paid a bit more for the next concert tour but the album deal was lousy.  Noel manages to get them out of their crappy recording contract with Warner and negotiate a much better one making them lots more money.  It was also his idea to do their own merchandising which meant they would make a lot of money off of it rather than if they let someone else handle it and take a small percentage of the profits.

This book is filled with plenty of backstage antics such as trashed hotel rooms beyond the usual trashing, and one night when David went nuts trashing a room and ended up in a straightjacket because the tour manager couldn't get control of David and he happened to have one on hand.  The many stunts they pulled on each other that in the beginning caused laughs but by the end of the 1984 tour was causing them to want to kill each other.

There were also plenty of girls backstage and plenty of doctors giving the boys' penicillin shots for STDs.  However, during the first tour when they were doing a leg of the tour in England with Black Sabbath, nearly the entire audience was male so there were few groupies to have sex with and they guys went without a lot, which made David unbearable to be around.  When they sold more records and became more popular the better class of girls came backstage.

Also, the biggest thing about Van Halen was the drinking and the drugs. Edward and Alex were alcoholics and Edward would become addicted to cocaine.  Alex was what you would call a functional alcoholic.  He might not remember what he played the night before but he never made a mistake in his playing of the drums. Likewise, Edward's playing was not affected by his abuses but he wasn't functional as Alex.  He was pretty much out of it.  David knew not to get totally wasted before a concert, though he did on a least one occasion and it was a disaster with him slurring his words and not being able to jump about on stage like he usually does. This was a double disaster as it was the US Festival and it was being filmed.  But for the most part, you could count on Van Halen giving you a kickass concert that was worth more than the cost of your ticket, according to Noel.

The person who doesn't get talked about much in this book is the bass player, Michael Anthony, but when he is the author makes a point to put down his playing but says that he sings better than David Lee Roth, only he lacks the front man abilities.  Michael is a sweet guy who is dating his high school sweetheart, so he doesn't really get into the groupies. He drinks, but he seems to have a control over it.  But his niceness is his downfall as the band will attack him knowing he won't fight back.  The one I feel who really get cheated, betrayed, and loses out here in this book is not Noel, but Michael Anthony.

One point that is made about this band often is that they are like children, mostly unruly children.  At the beginning of the book, they are innocent of the ways of the music world and the world at large.  Months before his wedding to Valerie Bertinelli, Edward gets hit with a paternity suit and Noel needs to find out if there's any truth to it. Ed is freaking out that he might have gotten this woman pregnant because he did spend time with her. But the only sexual acts performed were blow jobs and Ed wants to know if he could have gotten her pregnant.  He really has no idea.

This was an interesting book, though I don't know how much of it to believe. The reason it is only coming out now is that Noel sued them after he was fired and part of the deal was that he not write anything about the band for a certain period of time.  I guess that time has finally passed.  At the same time, some of this stuff is pretty easy to believe knowing what you know about the band.  David Lee Roth is an egomaniac and some of the vanity stuff about him is pretty easy to believe.  But you do have to keep in mind that Noel has an agenda and a biased point of view.  It did make for some interesting reading though.",1520208000,3

7572,656,1068,"How far would you go to keep immigrants out of your community? In this brilliant book by T.C. Boyle, we meet two couples: Affluent and liberal Delaney and Kyra, who live in a mansion in a gated community in Topanga Canyon, California; and Cndido and Amrica, illegal Mexican immigrants who are camping at the bottom of the canyon for lack of anywhere else to live and trying to survive on a few dollars a daywhen they are lucky. (Oh, and America is 17 and pregnant.) The story opens when Delaney, driving his Lexus up the curvy and hilly canyon road, careens into Candido. This begins a parallel plot of the two couples whose live unknowingly intersect and are destined to collide. It's a classic story of the haves vs. the have-nots, but told in such a personal way that it will grab your heart and not let go.

The writing is exquisite, and the characters so fully developed they nearly pop off the page. Boyle is such a talented writer that he honestly portrays the characters feelings, actions and traitsgood and bad. I felt sympathy for all of them, as well as frustrated and annoyed with them. It's real life in a book!

But know this: It is not an easy read emotionally. As a reader, you will be drawn into the characters' problems and tragedies and it affected me powerfully.

The most surprising part of ""The Tortilla Curtain"" is that it was written well over 20 years ago and is still absolutely relevant today. How much does it truly cost to keep immigration at bay? And how much does it cost to live the American way of life or is it a dream that can never be realized?",1520208000,5
7573,315,501,"It is well written. The idea of a storyteller in the story is not unique but very effective. We could ponder over the word darkness for quite some time. The best way to ponder is with Cliff's Notes. Personally I wanted him to get on with it. I guess I was a little impatient for the action and the conclusion. If it hadn't been for cliff notes I would have missed haft the things he was implying.

A merchant company is missing an agent Kurtz, and Marlowe must find him. Traveling though harsher environments than he imagined possible he may have found what he was seeking. As with many of this type of epic the physical distance or direction is not as important then the transformation it plays on ones soul.

I missed this book somehow in school. The reason I started to read this book before actually I actually became immersed in it, was to see how close it came to the movie. No not the movie you are thinking of. ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" (1988).

7577,217,593,"I learned some interesting things about North Korea (and China, South Korea and Laos). I knew that people lived at different levels of privilege in N.K. but did not know that those levels dated back to the Korean War and who was most loyal to the leader Jong Il. There are many levels and some differences are very subtle. Also, people rarely move up the chain but small infractions against the Dear Leader (verbal or non-verbal) can move you down. This was told as an example when the little girls' house caught fire and the dad ran back into his burning house to rescue the painting of the Dear Leader. His picture was (and now his son's) everywhere...in every house, classroom, buildings, murals, statues...everywhere. I don't want to tell too many details but this book it spends a lot of time with a girl and then a young woman who was very indecisive about what she wanted from life. I did not notice much wish for freedom and actually was never clear on why she left North Korea suddenly (something about she felt it was her last chance).
Her big motivation was to get herself and her family to South Korea. I won't tell you about the travels and problems they encountered together and separately but will say she seemed very lucky in getting people to give her quite large amounts of money.
I was also surprised that if you get to the South Korean embassy then they will accept North Koreans. They must stay in camps of a sort while things are sorted but when they leave they will receive a stipend to live on. it seemed to be enough for food, clothing, and shelter. Also, she and her brother had the opportunity for education...she at the university level.
It was an interesting book but I must say I would have liked more of what she was thinking than what ID she was going to use to go where.

This is one of those books that can be easily ruined for you if someone gives too much away and several reviewers have already done so. I had one of the reveals ruined for me this way and Im still mad at myself for being nosy and checking out that review. I don't know why people feel the need to do that without marking things as a spoiler because its not that hard!

There will be no spoilers here and I will be annoyingly vague. Trust me, its for your own good.

This story revolves around three people. Louise is a single mom struggling with insecurities since her ex announced hes having a baby with his newest lover. She works as a secretary at a doctors office. One night she meets a charming man named David at a bar. They share a drunken kiss but Louise is scared off when she realizes hes married. Who needs that mess, right? Well, what seems like the very next day, she arrives at work to discover David is the newest doctor in the practice and she is now his secretary. She is embarrassed and a little tingly. He is so very handsome, after all. Surely he wouldnt want her anyway, she thinks, after seeing his perfect wife. Speaking of his wife, her name is Adele and one morning Louise accidentally bumps into her so hard, the fragile beauty falls to the ground. Adele is kind and friendly and in desperate need of a friend and Louise is drawn to her and enjoys her company. But Adeles friendship comes with a condition. Louise must never tell David about their friendship.

Why you ask? Well I am not going to tell you. This is only the very beginning of one of the most messed up love triangles Ive ever encountered. It is glorious and it must not be spoiled.

Im going to warn you that these people are not very likable. Theyre pretty horrible actually and I loved every minute of their two-timing, backstabbing, secretive, lying, selfish selves. They are all up to no good, almost all the time and it never got tiresome. I was riveted, fascinated and whatever other adjective you can think of that means this book was one I did not want to ever stop reading. That rarely happens and when it does Im giving that book five stars.

This is not your typical girl on all the books thriller and for that I am very thankful. I like some of those books but the world has its fill of them right now. This one is different. Youll either love it for that reason or despise it. I believe Pinborough was a horror writer for the majority of her writing career (yep, confirmed it as I have several Leisure titles in my tbr bins) and it works to her advantage in this book. She knows how to craft a creepy story that is deliciously evil and unflinchingly dark through and through. If you enjoy reading about devious, screwed up people I think you will enjoy this. Many hate it for its ending but for me that ending tied it all in perfectly.",1520208000,5

I don't even know where to start. I wanted to love this so much and all I did was struggle.

I liked Ana. Shes feisty and goes after what she wants. Di was sort of adorable, but I think Jax was my favorite. There are a lot of characters in this story and I gave up trying to keep track.

Plot wise, it was sort of boring. It felt like nothing happened. There was some serious action and a bit of a surprise towards the end. Unfortunately, it felt like the build up was nonexistent and I did spend a good portion of time wondering if I should DNF. Perhaps its because I don't know anything about Anastasia?

Overall, I honestly have no idea why I kept reading. The characters had promise and there was some excellent representation, but I wasn't ever captivated by the story. Im not sure if Ill read more than the ending of the sequel .

7587,277,1916,"The Final Six by Alexandra Monir, which is the first book in an unnamed YA SciFi/Dystopian series/trilogy. Having read Monir before, she writes YA very well, and I looked forward the reading this new one.  I am happy to say I loved The Final Six, and will wait impatiently for the next book.

In The Final Six, Earth is going through terrible climate change with the sea rising (tsunamis) to dangerous and death defying heights.  The world as we know it is slowly dying, with cities throughout the world going under water,  and with little hope of survival.  The International Space Committee has devised a desperation plan to send the most talented 16-18 years old young adults to Europa (Jupiter planet) to find a new habitual planet to send survivors to live before Earth is totally destroyed.  The plan is to quickly send 24 of the chosen ones to Americas Space center to quickly train them, and then pick the final six to go to Europa.

Right from the start, we meet Leo (a champion swimmer), who lives in Rome, and watched his whole family drown in the devastation that flooded his city.  Leo is despondent, and just about ready to kill himself, when he sees the announcement of the 24 chosen ones is about to be revealed.  He decides to go watch, hoping someone he knows will become part of this.  To his shock, his name is called and he is thrilled to be one of those to help find a solution to the worlds troubles.

Naomi Ardalan, is an American Science genius, who is also one of the chosen 24.  Naomi is the opposite of Leo, she is very unhappy to have been chosen, as she does not want to leave her family, especially her younger brother, whom she helps take care of.

Naomi and Leo will become friends, and eventually find themselves falling for each other.  This is not really a romance at this point, but it has started and they become even closer nearer to the end.  They both will work together, as Naomi suspects that something is not right, and she uses her hacking ability and other skills to delve into the truth.  Leo wants to protect and help Naomi, but he is also determined to be one of the final six.  There are a number of twists and turns, especially as we get closer to the end.

What follows is an in-depth look at the overall competition, as all participants have to go through so many mind boggling situations to train them on space travel and surviving on a foreign planet.  I loved everything about the complex completion, even if I am not really a Sci Fi buff.  Leo and Naomi were great heroes, and I did like a number of the other secondary characters. Of course, there are a couple of villains that we know to watch out for.  Will Leo and Naomi be part of the final six?  Will Naomi be able to find out the truth behind this mission?

The Final Six was a wonderful story line that kept our attention throughout.  I am amazed at the writing by Monir, especially with all the sci fi details.  I will not give spoilers, as you need to read this to enjoy everything.  But I will say there are some amazing surprises at the end, and of course, the dreaded cliffhanger.  I hate cliffhangers, but I will be there when Monir gives us the next book. If you enjoy YA dystopian, Sci Fi, competition,  great characters, mystery, and at little romance, I suggest to read this book.",1520294400,5
7588,1068,1916,"Space books, for me, are rare for me to really love. The concept has to be amazing to hold my attention.

Unfortunately, this book was not for me. I had heard so much about it including the option for film and I was excited to get a chance to review it before the release date. Sadly, it reminded me too much of Dare Mighty Things (which I loved) and I could not get past it.

The plot just didn't seem plausible. A lot of it was unconvincing and I'm no expert, but the whole thing just didn't fly for me. Things moved too quickly for me to get a grasp on things and I didn't see myself caring for the main characters. Both POV's Leo and Naomi, didn't read that much differently from each other and I often forgot who's I was reading.

Things I liked:

The pacing, as I said, was very quick which is good in most cases. I also enjoyed the diversity of the cast and I got to thinking that maybe this will work better on screen. Even though the romance was expected, i still enjoyed reading it because I'm big ol' softie and plus, I live in Italy and I may have swooned a little. But that is where it ended.

I know of a few people who would disagree with me and I am sure a lot of people will enjoy this book. I hope to see it on screen if it does get made.

7597,176,745,"As the father of two young boys, Im always looking for chapter books to read with my sons, and whenever possible I try to steer them towards the classics, just for an occasional break from Captain Underpants. Im not one of those grown-up readers who seeks out kid lit for its own sake, but I did enjoy James and the Giant Peach quite a bit. Originally published in 1961, it was the first childrens novel by British author Roald Dahl.

The story is about a young English boy named James Henry Trotter who lives a dark and dreary existence until a stranger gives him a handful of magic crocodile tongues. James accidently spills these little green rice-like objects on the ground under a peach tree, which results in the startling growth of the titular gargantuan fruit. After discovering a hole in the peach, James climbs inside, where he finds and befriends a group of intelligent, man-sized insects. Together they embark on a wacky journey that takes them far from home.

As is often the case with the protagonists of childrens literature, James is an orphan. He is forced to live with his two aunts, who serve the same function as the Evil Stepmother or Wicked Witch in many a fairy tale. This pair of harpies makes Jamess life a living hell by heaping upon him verbal and physical abuse. Most children to some extent see themselves as persecuted by authority figures who tell them what to do, so young readers will no doubt enjoy reading about how James liberates himself from these two terrible guardians. Dahl takes the aunts ill treatment of James to such an extent, however, that some young readers may even find it scary. Another aspect of the book that may not be suitable for everyone is Dahls repeated use of the A-word (synonymous with donkey) to describe a stupid person (If I actually type the word, Amazons database will reject this review). Sure, its not the worst case of profanity, but probably not something you want to add to your kids daily vocabulary either.

There really isn't much of a lesson to learn from James and the Giant Peach, which makes it even more fun. James makes friends along the way, and they work together to solve problems, so I suppose friendship is a theme, but mostly you just follow along on the bizarre adventure and enjoy it for what it is. Theres no heavy-handed moral that Dahl is pushing. For moms and dads, he satirizes Cold War paranoia in a few scenes, but not nearly to the extent that he does in his 1982 novel The BFG. Mostly, James and the Giant Peach is just a weirdly fun adventure with a lot of delightfully silly humor in it. My sons enjoyed it even more than I did and laughed out loud over quite a few passages. Though neither brief for a childrens book nor particularly dumbed-down in its vocabulary, my second-grade son didn't have any trouble reading the prose, but I think even kids as old as fourth or fifth grade would still get a kick out of the story.",1520294400,4

Just a few things I would change - I wish the deception plot in NYC would have ended quicker. Part of the reason I stayed up so late reading was because I was waiting to get to that reveal, and by the time I did, I was so far in I figured I'd just go ahead and finish the book. I would have like to get to Thabiso's country, Thesolo, a few chapters sooner. Because the story in NYC took up so much ink, I thought the mystery plot in Thesolo and its resolution were a little rushed. (A big deal was made about Ledi meeting her family, and I don't remember us actually getting to see her meet/speak with her grandparents.)

7605,282,1918,"I've been dying to read The Midnights ever since I saw Rachel Lynn Solomon, author of the AMAZING You'll Miss Me When I'm Gone, raving about it on Goodreads. I figured if she'd loved it I'd probably love it as well, and as it turns out, I was one hundred percent correct (thankfully!).

The Midnights is not just good but great. Combing lyrical writing, a drool-worthy setting, and a thoughtful coming-of-age, The Midnights is a standout YA debut, perfect for fans of Sarah Dessen's This Lullaby.

When the book first begins, Susannah is living a relatively normal life. She works at a coffee shop, has a crush on her guy best friend, and loves the midnight jam sessions her and her father have. Susannah is content with her life. She doesn't feel the need to ask for more, to work for more. She's not worried about college. She's just worried about coming up with the next great lyric. However, everything changes in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, her father- her idol, her rock -  is gone, and she's exiled to Orange, CA to live with a grandmother she didn't know she had and a mother she barely recognizes as the days go on.

I'll be honest: I didn't love Susannah at first. I didn't like how she treated her mother, or how selfish she could be when it came to putting her needs before others. Suffice to say it took me a long time to warm up to her; however, while I didn't always love her attitude and choices, there was something so incredibly compelling about her voice, something that made me keep reading, no matter the situation.  Over time, I began to understand Susannah more. I began to see her passion for music, why she was so willing to put it before everything else. It was her ""thing"" as well as her tie to her father, and I gave her dedication props. When Susannah moves to Orange, she has the opportunity to reinvent herself. Suddenly, she's in with the cool, elusive kids, the ones who drink, sneak into bars, and have midnight parties at the beach. Susannah slowly transforms, letting herself being influenced by people who shouldn't have say. I found this transformation to be interesting as well as realistic. I think it will resolve with anyone who's ever slowly changed a bits about themselves only to wonder later why they did it. By the end, I was happy I had accompanied Susannah on this journey. I was proud of who she had become and how she had transformed her life.

This book won't be for everyone. It's a slow novel, focusing on music, relationships, and grieving more than action and swoon-worthy romance. However, it worked for me, and for those like me who like novels that are character drive, I think it will work for them as well.

I appreciated the amount of time Sarah put into development here. First, she did an amazing job of developing the California setting. It was dreamy and evocative and fit perfectly with the feel of the book. I can't imagine this book being set any place but Orange. Second, Sarah did an amazing job of developing the relationships to be found here. Over the course of the book, Susannah begins to reevaluate her relationships. She begins to wonder what made her father so special to her, what made her so willing to overlook his flaws, and what she can do to be close to him even though he's gone. Her relationship with her mother is challenging. She has a lot of resentment towards her and she doesn't understand the majority of her decisions. Their relationship had many ups and downs, so many highs and lows, but there was something special to be found there. I also appreciated that there wasn't one guy. Instead, Susannah bounces from guy to guy over the course of the book, not because she can't decide on one, because each one feels perfect at the time. I found this to be realistic, because you don't always find the one in high school, and that's okay. Each relationship in a sense is just a building block in a sense.

The Midnights is a slow-burn, evocative novel. I look forward to reading more by Sarah in the future.",1520294400,5

While I really loved Susannah's character, I was deeply intrigued by the characters of her family. This book is definitely focused on Susannah's journey and discovery-process, but at the same time, she finds out new sides to her own family. It's almost like in this book she not only discovers who she wants to be, but also re-discovers her own family - including her father.

I think because of how deeply I identified with Susannah, it made the ending even more sweet to me - real tears were shed! She makes mistakes I made, she gives too much of herself in the gave of giving everything you have to someone, all while trying to figure out what is wrong with her. Her relationship with her mother was fantastic.

7609,898,1919,"It's been a while since I've read a Linda Howard book, most of the ones I've read were from the '90s- early '00s. Reading this book reminded so much of Demi Moore's G.I. Jane movie back in '97. Jina is a computer geek, she works communications for a paramilitary organization. When her boss grabs her and a few others like her and tells them he has a special job for them working with the GO-Teams and they can either go along with their new jobs or quit. Jina doesn't know the meaning of the word quit, she is determined that no matter how hard they push her she won't quit. The team she gets assigned to decides to take a hands on approach to her training, as the only female of the new recruits they are determined to push her harder than the others. They basically put her through boot camp/CRT (combat ready training) mixed all into one. The hard they push the harder she tries and everyday she earns their respect more and more. Levi the team leader personally wouldn't mind if Jina quit, because that means he could ask her out. Levi the one who nicknamed her Babe, doubted her abilities, she was after all just a computer geek the boss was forcing on them. Her job is to control the drone as their eye in the sky and keep a lookout in combat situations but to go into combat she has to be trained. Jina pushes herself harder than she ever has before and even when it scares her ****less she gets up and does it again.

Jina's training takes up about half the book, she finishes her training a couple weeks before the other recruits. Meanwhile a powerful Congresswoman who has it out for Jina's boss set into motion a trap to destroy the organization starting with taking out one of his teams. Levi and his team just happen to be the team sent out into the ambush, luckily Jina and her drone are in place and spot the ambush but unfortunately it's not enough and now the team has left to the rendezvous thinking Jina didn't make it, now she has to find her way to the pick up location or risk being stuck in Syria with no way home. Levi is torn he knows he has to put the lives of his men first, but the thought of leaving Jina even though he thinks she's already dead doesn't sit well with him and once he gets his men on the chopper he's going back for her.

The sexual tension between Levi and Jina is great, they think they are being subtle about it but some of the other guys on the team already guessed it. The entire time Jina is training you see the comradery build with her and the team, it goes from open hostility to grudging respect to treating her like a little sister. I loved this book Jina is my girl crush, she is my hero very GI Jane and Levi much like Viggo's Master Chief you want to hate him for everything he puts her through but really she wouldn't have been as good as she ended up being if he and the others didn't push her that hard. The respect and admiration between the two of them is pretty constant throughout the book even when he's pushing her he respects the fact that she keeps pushing back. This book is a definite keeper.",1520294400,5

I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

This is a fast paced thrilling story that has a woman who takes no prisoners and an alpha male who tries as hard as he can to resist his urges to protect his woman.

Levi is the main leader for a group of men who go in and gather intelligence, rescue people and help people defect. They are ex- military, normally. However, when his assignment is to integrate a new member in to his squad, Levi is less than thrilled.

Jina is, at heart, a computer geek. She is amazing at her job, but now that she has to leave the safety behind her desk for field operations, she knows it's either get through it or quit... She's not a quitter. Despite having a grueling training schedule and a group of men who she's not sure about, Jina bites the bullet and plows through.

The love story in this thriller is minor, but enough to keep you interested. While some aspects of their relationship were somewhat strange and predictable, it wasn't a prominent enough part of the story to distract me. I do wish that there were more after, but hope that there will be more books for each of the Go members.",1520294400,5
7611,248,1794,"Lovely story of two women- Clare and Edith- told in two time frames- the 1950s and today.  Edith, after a brief but critical meeting, leaves Clare her home in Delaware, a home where she had not lived for many years.  Why she hasn't lived there and how the women are linked beyond their short meeting is at the root of this well written novel that will draw you in.  The earlier books in this trilogy are many books ago for me and I'd largely forgotten the details of Clare's life (and that of Cornelia) so this was pretty much a standalone for me.  Things felt a tad tangled early on but de los Santos does give you enough info to make it clear who's who and how they are related.  Love but also domestic violence is at the core of the plot.  You might find some of it disturbing.  That said, you'll also find Edith to be a hero, as is John, the police chief.  Getting Clare and Dev to the secret might be a tad complicated and some of the linkages a little forced but I very much enjoyed this.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  This is good old fashioned story telling with well rounded characters.",1520294400,5
7612,381,1920,"(Disclaimer: I received this free book as a gift. This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.)

There is no denying that The Poet X is lyrical. It's slam poetry style makes it easy to absorb, the pages turning faster and faster. In true slam poetry style, each poem packs a punch. Whether it is because it so accurately conveys the ache of family, or the injustice of sexism, or the confusion of youth - each poem leaves its marks and no words are wasted.

What I especially adored is the ways in which Acevedo talks about the challenges: the sexism, the religious influences, the necessity of having space to speak. It makes this entire book poignant.",1520294400,5
7613,275,1794,"Weaving back and forth in time, Ill Be Your Blue Sky by Marisa de los Santos is a rich tapestry of appealing characters, an inviting setting and a heartachingly poignant yet uplifting storyline.

Clare Hobbs wedding is imminent when doubts begin to set in about her fianc Zach Barfield. Their whirlwind engagement barely allowed her time to breathe let alone give serious thought to her concerns about Zachs sometimes volatile behavior. As she, her mom and her honorary mom are finalizing some last decorations, Clare finds herself listing reasons why she should marry Zach. The next day, just hours before the ceremony, Clare finds herself unexpectedly confiding in Edith Herron, a total stranger, about her misgivings about going through with the wedding. A thoughtful comment from Edith resonates so deeply with Clare that she knows breaking off the engagement is the right thing to do although the last thing she wants to do is hurt Zach.

Fast forward a few weeks and Clare is stunned to discover Edith has passed away and left her an inheritance: a beautiful house in Antioch Beach, DE. Needing some distance between her and Zach, who refuses to accept her decision, Clare happily sets off to check out her new house which Edith named Blue Sky House. During her explorations, she uncovers an intriguing mystery about Edith and Clare enlists the help of her childhood friend (and one time boyfriend), Dev Tremain to help her figure what this puzzling information means.

Clare is an engaging protagonist who has a solid background with a loving and involved family. She is kind-hearted and compassionate which explains why she finds it so easy to give Zach the benefit of the doubt after his angry outbursts.  After their break-up, she is  a little naive when confronted with his vitriol and she is a little too understanding and forgiving of his lapses in judgment and inappropriate behavior.

Clare is taken aback by Ediths generous bequeath and she is quite curious about both Blue Sky House and her benefactress. She delights in the bits and pieces of Ediths life she discovers while eagerly exploring her new house. She easily recognizes the love Edith and her husband, Joseph, shared while living there but she is confused to learn that Edith abandoned the house back in the 1950s and never returned.  Clare quickly unearths fascinating but bewildering information that she and Dev work together to untangle.

The chapters alternate between Clares quest in the present and Ediths life while she lived at Blue Sky House in the 1950s. Her marriage to Joseph was magical and filled with love but ended somewhat tragically. Needing an income, Edith turns Blue Sky House into a boardinghouse for vacationing families and individuals. A chance meeting with a wealthy visitor forever alters her life and sets her on a path that eventually intertwines with Clare in the present.

Ill Be Your Blue Sky is a beautifully written novel that features a heartwarming and meaningful storyline. Clare is sometimes a little too good to be true but this does not lessen her appeal.  Dev is incredibly charming and so wonderful that it is impossible not to like him. Edith is absolutely marvelous and her chapters add a depth and substance to the plot. Although several characters have been featured in previous novels by Marisa de los Santos, it is not necessary to read them to enjoy this latest release.

The lives of four pre- teens become inextricably linked in a series of bizarre coincidencesif there Is such a thingone day after school is out for the summer. Being lost and locked at the bottom of an abandoned well is no picnic. Will  Virgil be rescued in time? The plot could not develop without the use of cell phones and text messages (in gray boxes). We are truly in the era of social media. Mental gymnastics are also required as the short chapters switch narrators: from first person to 3rd person and back.

  Social issues in this YA novel include: prejudice against children with disabilities (such as hearing loss, extreme shyness) and that old school standby: bullying. The parents are portrayed as somewhat clueless, but one grandmother provides sound advice and unconditional love. The author also highlights the value of pets to help children cope with the world-- regardless of personal problems. My only beef as a mature adult is the blatant use of contemporary, conversational language. The WHATEVERs and LIKEs surely appeal to todays kids, but almost made me put this Newbery award winner down. Re character development: I am not sure if the local bully learned anything from his adventures as a snake hunter in the woods, but some lucky kids discovered that certain friendships were meant to be.

7615,134,1918,"You have to shake your notions of good and bad, and create outside of judgement. Follow the instinct, not he convention.

I wanted to love this so much and I just didn't and that makes me really sad. I was looking for this moving story of grief and family and  Susannah finding herself, but this book made me feel absolutely nothing. I didn't connect to it at all - not the characters, not the relationships, not the plot. Nothing. I cant remember the last book that I was completely apathetic towards.

I found the pacing in the beginning to be really disjointed and rushed. Because of that I never bought any of the relationships. This was really detrimental because Susannahs relationship with her dad is incredibly important to the story and its progression, but I just didn't care about it. There was also this reflective quality to the writing, that while worked for the story, felt out of place. There was moments when the narration read like a voiceover looking back at what happened, but it was used infrequently and pulled me out of the story. Even the music element, which I usually love in story fell flat here. I didn't feel Susannahs connection to the music. I just didn't feel much of anything. So The Midnights was a super unfortunate miss for me, but Im sure A LOT of people will really love it and connect with it, so its worth a shot if you're in the mood for a contemporary with a little more depth.

I've never read a Southern California so raw and alive and unapologetic. Sarah Nicole Smetana's prose should be savored like the darkest dark chocolate. So many lines burrowed into my heart and stuck in my throat. I loved and ached for Susannah, grieving the sudden loss of the musician father who didn't have enough time for her. Every member of Susannah's friend group is deeply realized, nuanced, and compelling. This book is 400 pages, but I'd happily have read another hundred.

7620,128,1919,"FINAL DECISION: A great personal story about Jina that is miscast as both a romance and a type of action/suspense/thriller. There seems to be an excellent book about Jina's journey that is joined awkwardly with a villain story.

THE STORY: Jina Modell works for a secret paramilitary organization working with computers. When it is determined that the ops teams need communications and drone operators with each team, Jina is reassigned against her preferences to be an active part of a team. That means that Jina has to undergo intense physical training. But Jina finds hidden strength in herself that changes everything she knew about herself and also her life.

OPINION: This could have been a great book, but it really wasn't the book I expected. The book ended up reading more like a women's fiction story. Now the story of Jina was really, really good. I loved watching her struggle with her inclusion in the active team. She is a woman who finds out what she is made of and that she can do whatever she puts her mind to. What I really liked about this book is that Jina's journey is neither easy nor perfect. She doesn't become a super-soldier but rather a strong and capable woman. Even better, she becomes so strong that she makes a decision towards the end of the book that feels incredibly right and mature.

Jina is really the focus of the book. Her nominal romance partner feels less developed and their romance is really secondary to Jina's story. This book is likely to disappoint many who are looking for a romance, but I still enjoyed the romance as a part of Jina's journey.

The negative portion of this book is the whole villain story which flows from TROUBLEMAKER. The storyline is somewhat confusing and is really unnecessary to the story. I feel the book would have been much better without bringing the villain into the story at all. The entirety of the plot device that the villain serves could have accomplished in a way that kept the emphasis on Jina.

Ultimately, I found this to be a good story contained in a flawed book. I probably would not think to return to this book again even though I really loved Jina who I found to be a compelling character.

WORTH MENTIONING: The blurb and title for this book are pretty misleading. The incident referred to in the blurb happens at almost the end of the book.

CONNECTED BOOKS: This book is connected to TROUBLEMAKER but can be read as a standalone except that the motivations for some of the characters come from the events in TROUBLEMAKER.

STAR RATING: I give this book 3 stars.

NOTE: I received an ARC of this book via Edelweiss in order to prepare this review. I was not required to write a review or to write a positive review. All opinions contained herein are my own.",1520294400,3
7621,248,1919,"Read this less as a thriller than as a novel of a woman coming into her own and a romance.  Jina is a fish out of water with the special ops people and much of the early part of this fast paced book is about her getting into shape and becoming capable of joining the Go Team.  Well, it's also a set up for a romance with Levi/Ace.  There's a topical issue with Syria, a conspiracy involving a Congresswoman (this part is a little murky), and danger looming.  You know LEvi/Ace is going to rescue Jina when things go bad.  There's a small element of damsel-in-distress but it's a fast, if implausible (not a chance Jina would actually be allowed to do this) read.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.

7622,552,1919,"The Woman Left Behind is simply Linda Howard at her best. The story is rapid-paced and totally believable, the characters strong and likable, and the thrills are non-stop. This was a joy to read, and will go on my keep shelf.

Jina Model, Babe is a computer geek working for a special ops group, the GO teams. She is happy in her behind-the-scenes role in communications-until her ability to play video games gets her and ten others a job as a drone operator in the field. Of all the newly transferred drone operators, she alone is taken in hand by the team she is expected to work with, Her new boss, Levi Ace Butcher, makes it clear she is the least important member of the team. He also makes it clear that he expects her to wash out of the training.

But Jina is not a quitter. In spite of the fact that she likes to be clean and is terrified of parachute jumps, she takes on every challenge and is the first to graduate from drone training and report for active duty. From the beginning, she ignores her attraction to Levi, knowing that a romance while they are on the same team is asking for trouble. What makes it harder is the fact that he also makes his attraction to her clear, but only to her. He would love for her to wash out of the team so he could ask her out, but he won't do anything to make the job harder for her.

But his warning about being the least valuable member of the team becomes all too clear when the team is pulled into an ambush in Syria, and the bunker where Jina is hiding while operating the drone explodes. With two members of his team desperately wounded, Levi makes the call to bug out, intending to come back and find her body. But Jina has not been training for months without results-and runs through the desert by herself to the pick up point.

Now she has to decide: can she stay a part of a team where she is deemed expendable? And can her love for Levi survive the fact he left her in the desert without even checking to see if she was alive?

The intense force of the attraction between these two strong, stubborn people is drawn with a delicate hand, yet there is no denying the pull. Jina is one of Howard's best heroines to date and Levi is a yummy alpha male. Whatever the difference is between a good book and a great one, Howard takes this one across the line firmly into being a great one.

7624,134,1920,"Xiomara may be remembered as a lot of things: a student, a miracle, a protective sister, a misunderstood daughter, but most importantly, she should be remembered as always working to become the warrior she wanted to be.

Tell me you did not get chills! I feel like its really hard to review novels told in verse, because I always seem to become incredibly invested in the characters and I turn into a gushing mess. The Poet X is really no different. Its a beautiful story of finding your voice and finding your power.

Things I Liked
Xiomara was amazing and I love her. She has this inner strength and conviction that I admire more than I can say. I loved seeing the world from her point of view.  I loved seeing her reflect on her experiences with religion. She actively questions things and doesnt have the highest opinion on religion. We see her confront sexism. She is constantly objectified and reduced to her body by men around her. We also see her start to explore her  sexuality and what she wants in a relationship. I really loved seeing her  family dynamics explored as well. And while we don't really get much of her dad, I loved her relationship with her brother, Xavier, and my heart broke seeing her relationship with her mom.

My favorite thing was seeing Xiomara explore poetry and find this inner freedom that lets her breathe and exists and feel present. It was beautiful. It was powerful. It made me so proud to see her find herself, and to really start to love sho she was.

The writing was so stunning. Not only were there a million beautiful quotes (see below), but the imagery was vivid and bright, while also being raw and realistic. I felt like I was with Xio, a part of her world, and it made it so easy to devour this book and really become invested in. I also thought that each chapter really built to showcase more about Xiomara, her thoughts, her world, her life and made the story feel full and honest.

QUOTES
...but one thing I know for sure is that reputations last longer than the time it takes to make them.

...She knows since she was little, the world would not sing her triumphs, but she took all of the stereotypes and put them in a choke hold until they breathed out the truth

Maybe the only thing that has to make sense about being somebodys friend is that you help them be their best selves on any given day.

Things I Didnt Like
There wasn't really anything I didn't like, but I would have loved to see more of Xiomara and Xaviers relationship. Dont get me wrong, I loved what I saw from them and I though their relationship was well established, but I would have loved more. I know verse stories are much more focused on the main character and can be very internal, but I selfishly love twin relationships and want to see all of them explored.

This was such a quick book to read, I read it in one sitting, but it definitely hits you emotionally (I teared up twice and cried once). This story is heartbreaking and hopeful and freeing and honest and raw. Its an amalgamation of every conflicting thought youve ever had put to page, and makes you feel like you're not alone.  As someone who loves character driven stories, The Poet X is a book you cannot miss.",1520294400,5
7625,649,356,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Robert Fagles translations of both The Odyssey and The Iliad, much more than I did the first time I read them in school. To even attempt a critique of the work itself would be to take yet another journey down a well-traveled road, so I will more usefully suggest why this particular translation is likely to be a good choice for most people.

If you are one of the 99% of us that will read these classics in translation and not in the original Greek, there are a dizzying number of English translations to choose from, some in prose and others in verse, spanning a century or more. If you are not reading this as assigned schoolwork (where that decision is generally made for you), you may be trying to decide if this edition, translated by Robert Fagles, is the one you should choose. My own belief is that for most modern readers, this translation is a great choice.

The Fagles editions of The Odyssey and The Iliad are very readable translations in contemporary English, and I enjoyed them much more than I did the first time I read these classics (decades ago) in different translations. I would recommend these to those reading these classics for the first (and possibly only) time, particularly if doing so on ones own and outside an academic environment.

Those deep enough into Homer to have different translations of these classics as their favorites will have read them more than once, and their first exposure would NOT have been the Fagles translation. I think a reader is more likely to return to these again if the first time reading them was a pleasant experience with literature one could understand.
My advice is not to worry too much about whether or not those older versions are more faithful to the original. This is academic hair-splitting for most readers. Every translation from the original can never be truly exact, and is only the translators interpretation. And when it comes to verse, poetry only really works in its original tongue; a translator can make the finished product read like poetry also, but it won't be the SAME poetry, especially when the original and target languages are not compatible.

Both The Odyssey and The Iliad include nice introductions by Bernard Knox with some nice commentary. These were long but not TOO long. There is also about a dozen pages of Notes on the Translation pointing to particular line numbers (although unfortunately not noted at the applicable points in the text itself, which would have been helpful). There is also a very helpful Pronouncing Glossary listing every name mentioned in the book, with a pronunciation and a short description of who it is; this helped a lot in keeping the names straight, especially in The Iliad where there are so many more of them.

I bought The Odyssey and The Iliad as a boxed set, and the quality of the paperbacks and their bindings was very good. The covers are durable, and the sturdy spine and glued pages look secure enough to withstand many readings.",1520294400,5
7626,518,191,"Misfit teen Meg Murray, her genius-scary little brother Charles Wallace, and her newfound boyfriend Calvin O'Keefe, with every encouragement from three very strange ladies, set out to find Meg's father, the missing Dr. Murry, on a faraway planet reachable only through A WRINKLE IN TIME.  This innovative and occasionally challenging sci-fi novel involves teen angst, a classic search-and-rescue plot, references to universal religious spirit, and no small amount of good ol' adventure.  Best read alone by kids ten and older, indeed kids of any age as I found upon my successful third reading yesterday.  Highly recommended.  The Murrys, O'Keefe's and their descendants went on to figure in seven more Madeleine L'Engle books, collectively called the ""Kairos"" series.  This one is soon to be a major Disney motion picture with real-life actors, though I for one found the news that the movie dispenses with most-if-not-all religious reference highly disconcerting.

I highly recommend WRINKLE to exploring spirits of any age, as well as to those who value, as an earlier generation would have said, a ripping good yarn.  Let me mention that Madeleine L'Engle lived from 1918 to 2007, was born in New York City, attended Smith, but spent most of her life in rural Connecticut. She is the author of over 20 books, about half of them novels that belong to two series: this one (Murry-O'Keefe or Kairos), and the less ""fantastical"" Chronos series involving the Austin family. Many people find that after their first exposure to Meg and the other Murrys in WRINKLE, they want to go on to read the other seven books in Kairos as well.

7630,970,1838,"I received this book in free for an honest review, which in no way sways my judgement.

I loved this book immensely. How much? Enough that when I think about it I get this big dopey and dreamy look on my face.  Never have I found a fantasy book that hit ALL. THE. THINGS. I. LOVED. Seriously, Ross has a way of making a soft floaty book never dull. What does the mean exactly? Well, when you read fantasy or epic adventure type stories there is always a part where it either drags or the author seems to have written themselves into a corner and has to do a huge plot twist/super bad thing to the main character to move the story along. Which I hate. I hate being invested in a character and there be bad things repeatedly happening to them. I get so, so sad. In the Queens Rising I was left struck by the age old Oh no, something bad HAS to be coming up. The story is moving too easily for Brienna. Yes, there was small road blocks but not the type that are overused. Also, the fact that Brienna isn't the end all chosen one in the grand scheme of things but a small part in the rebellion really hammered home how well Ross can create a story. I was never pushed into feeling like Brienna needed to be more. She simply does her best and helps everyone while being strong and independent on her own.

For once, we have a fantasy book that goes according to plan. Things go off without a hitch and until I finished this book I never realized how much I wanted this. This story proves how even when an adventure isn't fraught with constant struggle its still possible to create a stunning, addicting book that never dulls. And the writing! Oh the writing! It was so visually stunning and imaginative everything about the world Brienna lived was lush and beautiful and I yearned to step onto the page and experience it myself. I honestly do not even know how to describe it because nothing will do it justice. From this point on no matter what Ross writes she is an instant buy author for me.

Im not going to give anything away but the romance in this book is so fluffy and cute and just *dreamy sigh* paired with the epic quest of someone who is not the chosen one, this book is a must buy and read for everyone.",1520294400,5
7631,889,1922,"Okay, real quick, Im going to do a little PSA, since I think a lot of you might need it:
Bisexuals who are with boys are still bisexual. Bisexuals who are with girls are still bisexual. Bisexuals who are with people who identify as nonbinary are still bisexual. Bisexuals who have never been with anyone are still bisexual.

And the fact that I still have to say this, in 2018, is why Inkmistress is now one of my favorite YA Fantasies of all time. We need books, of all genres, that normalize sexuality in every aspect. But you all might not realize how rare it is to read a book about a bisexual girl ending up with a boy and still seeing her bisexuality beautifully on display. This book moved me to tears. And I believe with my whole heart that this book is going to be one of my all-time favorites.

You would never hurt anyone on purpose, Asra, and that is both your strength and your weakness.

Inkmistress follows one of my new favorite protagonists, Asra, who lives her life secluded away in the mountains. She lives her life in hiding, only traveling down to the village below when weather permits it, to help them with births and other medicinal needs. Yet, some people still view her as a witch. But what Asra really is is so much more powerful.

Asra has the power to change the future, present, and past with her blood. Yet, at a cost. To be able to wield such power, it takes from her lifeforce and ages her. But we soon learn that there isn't anything she wouldnt do for a girl who has accepted her when no one else has.

Also in this world, people come into adulthood when they are able to manifest, or bond with an animal by being blessed by the six gods that truly do control this world. Obviously, some animals are more powerful than others, but the most important thing is to just be able to manifest.

Asra feels like she has no other choice but to grant the girl, who she loves more than anything in this world, her wish: to finally manifest. And manifest Ina does. Into something more powerful than Asra imaged. Unfortunately, it is not the happiest of celebrations, because Asra learns again that it is a very scary thing to wish for something, and there will always be consequences of shaping the future.

From there we are sent on a journey and an adventure, where Asra is trying to do the right thing, while also trying to learn who and what she really is. And I promise, it is nothing short of amazing. And we get to meet so many wonderful side characters. Even though Im very biased towards Hal, who is a PoC who stole my heart completely. I instantly loved him. And let me tell you, the Romance in this book is everything Ive ever wanted in my life, seriously.

Love was the way he made me laugh when I least thought it possible, and the way our voices came together to sing a tavern song inappropriate for most company. Love was the way he kissed me until I knew without doubt that anywhere he was would be home.

This book has such an important discussion on unconditionally love, and how you are always worthy and deserving of it. We see unapologetic heartbreak in this book, and its not easy to read, but its so important to read. Very rarely is your first love your only love, and sometimes you figure that out in a very hurtful way. And just in general, nothing hurts worse than when someone you love hurts you, betrays you, or chooses to not love you anymore. Learning that it is okay to love again, and that you are worthy of love, is something that so many people struggle with, myself included. And in case you need a reminder, from a random book reviewer: You are deserving of love, always and forever, you are deserving of love.

In these dark and lonely moments, did she think of me as I thought of her?

And I see people saying this feels info-dumpy? But I honestly didn't feel like that at all. Maybe it is because I read so much Adult High and Epic Fantasy? But I easily understood and fell in love with the world and the world building. I thought it was super easy to understand, yet I was completely mesmerized at every new development. Like, I truly think this world was close to perfect in my eyes.

And this is completely irrelevant to my rating, but I still have to shout it from the rooftops: This book has one of my all time favorite names! And you all know Ive read a lot of books, and this was the first time I have ever seen it printed in a story. And Im not that big of a tease to not tell you all; the name is Garen, and I first fell in love with it back 2011 when I first installed League of Legends. Well, its 2018 and it is still my all-time favorite, so I couldn't resist gushing. Also, to further prove that the universe perfectly aligned to put this book into my hands.

And this book is truly a blessing. It had everything I like to see in my Fantasy: Girls with hidden powers, blood magic, herbal healing, gods, tyrant kings, traveling from city to city, secret societies, swoon-worthy romance, friendship, motherhood, twists, turns, betrayals, and dragons. Honestly, I know Im not even near considered a teen anymore, but I feel like I was completely targeted by this book. And I think so many of my Adult Fantasy reader friends would love this one, too.

The writing is beautiful, the journey and adventure were perfection, the messages are so important. I was living for the feministic themes, I was swooning over the romance, I was crying over the reveals. I will carry this story with me forever, I will recommend this story to every fantasy lover I ever meet, I will always consider myself blessed to have been privileged enough to open this book.

The only negative thing I can even think of saying is that Im kicking myself that I haven't read Of Fire and Stars yet. I feel like this book did such a wonderful job hinting at what is to come, and I am so excited. I am 100% obviously telling you that you can read this first and completely enjoy the story, but I bet youd get a lot of enjoyment if you have read Of Fire and Stars.

Overall, this was everything to me. It means more to me than I can say, or any word combination my fingers could type for you. I loved this. I truly loved this with the sum of my being. And the more I think about it, the more I fall in love with it. I just hope you all give it a try and fall in love with it, too.",1520294400,5

7633,322,125,"This is just a fantastic book  one of my long-time favorites.  Of course, Ray Bradbury, generally, is one of my long-time favorites!

My hubby read this book to me while I was recovering from eye surgery.  Just before starting this book, he finished reading me a current popular book, and was trying to read this book with the same rhythm and pacing  which gave him some trouble.  I said, Just read it.  Dont try to impose a rhythm.  Let it wash over you.  Bradbury is his own music.  Wow!  After that (only a couple of pages in), the story flowed like Bradbury always does for me.  Bradburys writing is magical, dancing, lyrical, visual music.

To give an example, I just now opened the book to a random page.  Here, in two sentences, is where our hero, Montag, finds his wife after she has taken too many sleeping pills:

Her face was like a snow-covered island upon which rain might fall, but it felt no rain; over which clouds might pass their moving shadows, but she felt no shadow.  There was only the singing of the thimble-wasps in her tamped-shut ears, and her eyes all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.

In two sentences, not only can I picture this scene vividly, but I am with Montag, noting the details clinically, yet feeling the horror, and disappointment, and almost fruitless love he feels for her.

Completely outside the wonderful writing, this is a terrific story.  We are in the future, in a world dominated by visual media  most of which says nothing at all but which is inescapable, chattering or yelling or whispering to the masses.  Books have been banned as containing too many dangerous ideas.  The government does not want people to turn their eyes from the TV or to think past the messages contained there.

In this world, Montag is a fireman  someone who burns any books that are discovered still in existence.  This is how it happens:  A call is received that a neighbor might have a book, the alarm sounds in the fire station, and the firemen race out with their kerosene-filled truck, and burn the house to the ground.  Our firemen wear patches displaying 451  the temperature at which paper burns.  One day, Montag incomprehensibly rescues a book about to be burned, drawn to find out about the danger within.  Then, he meets a neighbor girl who, strangely, avoids the ubiquitous television.  Instead, she talks, she questions, she thinks.  As you can imagine, Montag is now lost, seeing his world through different eyes  proving, I suppose, the danger of books

I haven't read this book in probably a decade, but I remember thinking then how presciently Bradbury had envisioned this possible future  especially given he wrote it in 1953.  I must say, on re-reading now, it seems even more visionary, and therefore, frightening.

I don't suppose I need to say it, but I will.  This book is, in my opinion, a must-read and very highly recommended!",1520294400,5

7635,278,1916,"""Our goals at NASA remained the same: to push the boundaries of space and find a new home for human life. That doesnt change when something bad happens.

First of all my ranting. Nowhere in the promos for this book or in the description of this book does it mention that it is the first book in a series. Nowhere. So you can imagine just how happy I was when about halfway through the book I realized there was no way that all the loose ends would be tied up by the final page. AND you can guess how really happy I was when the book ended in a cliffhanger ending.

Okay, so why did I rate it five stars? Because it's a great book -  characters I could identify with (I wanted to be an astronaut as a young girl and I was a science geek), believable storyline, scary world building.

24 teenage young men and women from around the world are drafted to participate in the International Space Training Camp based at Johnson Space Center. Six finalists will be chosen for a manned flight to Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, where they will terraform and start a colony so more people of Earth can follow.

Oh yeah, Earth is in the process of destroying itself with most of it underwater at this point.

The story is told in two points of view - Leo from Italy and Naomi, an American of Persian background. Both have reasons they do not want to go or just can't wait to go.

I liked the book a lot - enough to overlook that it's a series book.

7638,235,1923,"4 beautiful, character-driven stars to All the Beautiful Girls!    

I was three quarters of the way through before I put it together that Elizabeth Church, the author, also wrote a book I listened to last year, The Atomic Weight of Love. All the Beautiful Girls is such a departure, I am still wrapping my head around both books being written by the same author. I actually preferred All the Beautiful Girls.

Lilys family is killed by a mysterious man called The Aviator who will play a big part in Lilys story throughout her life. Lily is a sympathetic character from the start. I was rooting for her and hoping she would find her way to a happier life; however, her hard times were very hard. Her childhood was dark with an uncle who abused her for years.

The settings were atmospheric: Kansas in the 1950, Las Vegas in the 1960s, and New Mexico in the 1970s. At first glance, thinking of a woman desiring to be a Vegas showgirl, choosing that over her own education, one might make judgments that this story is lacking substance; however, Church presents this in a way that exposes abuses and the objectification of women based on their looks. While a Vegas showgirl might be glowing and beautiful under the shiny lights, there can be tragic story behind that lipsticked smile. There was for Lily. Will she ever escape her past?

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Lilys story and processing all the underlying messages in the stunning prose.

All the Beautiful Girls will be published on March 6, 2018. Thank you to Elizabeth Church, Random House Ballantine, and Netgalley, for the complimentary copy.",1520294400,4
7639,277,1923,"All the Beautiful Girls by Elizabeth J. Church is a standalone novel.  I did not know what to expect when I decided to read this book, and I was totally surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  All the Beautiful Girls was a different type of read for me, but I am glad I read it.

Lily Decker is our heroine, and we meet her at the age of 8 years old. Her parents and sister were killed in a car crash, and Lily was sent to live with her Aunt and Uncle.  Her life changed drastically, as her Aunt was very strict and not very loving.  Her Uncle was a nightmare for Lily, as he sexually abused her.  Lily would look for a friendship with the Aviator, a man who survived the accident that killed her family.  Though he felt responsible, Lily knew it was an accident, and soon he would become a friend who would make her life bearable.  The Aviator would send her books, as Lilly loved to read, and also paid for her to go to dancing school.  When she reached 18, Lily leaves her home in Kansas, to find a job dancing in Las Vegas.

When she arrives in Vegas, Lily changes her name to Ruby Wilde, and loves the bright lights of 1960s Vegas and showgirls galore.  Not knowing where to go, Ruby will luck out meeting the father of a girl who is a showgirl, and soon Ruby will find two friends (Rose & Vivid) who will teach her the ropes. Life as a showgirl in Vegas, turns Ruby into a successful entertainer, with all the costumes (noted in description above: costumes  dripping with feathers and rhinestones, five-inch heels, and sky-high headdresses).  She learns to become strong, independent and know how to handle men, without being sexual. Rubys success, enables her to make a lot of money, and her friendship with Rose and Vivid becomes a bond between the girls.  This part of the story we very well done, as we got to see life on the stage, and all the stars of those days; Sammy Davis, Tom Jones, and others.  I really enjoyed all the glitz and glamour.

Despite her happiness and contentment, Ruby still has a sense of loneliness, and when she meets someone she  feels is true blue, Rubys life will change, as things will unexpectedly turn for the worse.  Though her friends are still there for her, it is the Aviator (who she continued to keep in touch with) who will be there for Ruby again.

Lily Decker will move  to New Mexico, as she recovers from the sad end of her Vegas career.  Lily will finally find peace, especially as the Aviator (Stirling) and Jack are both gay lovers, and she learns to love both of them as family.  Finally, Lily has people who love her for who she is. Stirling and Jack were totally awesome, and I also loved the time she spent living with them. Lily will heal over time, and explore her love of designing, which will eventually lead her into a sweet happy life.

All the Beautiful Girls was a very good book, with some excellent characters, both good and bad. It is a story of loss, survival, healing, tragedy, innocence, forgiveness and love.  This  was also a fun story, with some intense and sad moments.  I loved Lily/Ruby and throughout the book, I found myself rooting hard for her.  Elizabeth J. Church has written a story that was so very well done.  I wholly suggest you read All The Beautiful Girls.  It is a gem.",1520294400,5

This is one for those who enjoy good stories- stories that sometimes aren't easy to read and sometimes go a tad over the top.  Ruby's struggles as a woman in the 1960s and early 70s will ring true, as will her self destructive tendencies.  She doesn't always make the best choices but she's always sympathetic.  There is hope and positivity here, not only as she finds her way but also as she finds first the Aviator and then Jack and learns that not all men are like her uncle.

7648,185,359,"Can Scarlet trust Wolf?

Scarlet has a good life living with her grandmother on a farm in France. She loves living in the country and working the land. Everything changed the day her grandmother disappeared, and Scarlet is the only one who suspects foul play. When a mysterious man named Wolf claims to have information about her grandmother, Scarlet is skeptical. Desperate to find her grandmother, Scarlet and Wolf form a fragile partnership. As Scarlet digs deeper into her Grandmothers disappearance, she realizes her grandmother has many secrets, secrets others will kill for.

Scarlet is a great heroine. Shes smart, determined, and fiercely loyal. Even though the odds of finding her grandmother are slim, she never gives up. Her strength and persistence are admirable. Shes also very kind. Scarlet is the kind of woman who gives people a chance. This is especially true with Wolf. She has no reason to trust him, but Scarlet sees something good in him.

I must admit I find Scarlet and Wolfs romance a bit strange. Understandably, it took them a while to warm up to each other. However, once they did, they seemed to have an instant, powerful connection. At first it didn't feel very realistic to me, but I was warming up to the idea by the end of the book. Im curious to see how their relationship will develop as the series progresses.

I enjoyed seeing more of Cinder in this book. She is slowly adjusting to the idea that not only is she Lunar, but also Princess Selene. A bit more of Cinders history is revealed, and it is heartbreaking. So many people risked so much to save her. Thats a lot of pressure for a young girl to live up to. I believe Cinder is up for the challenge.

I absolutely must mention Cinders new friend, Carswell Thorne. Cinder and Thorne find themselves stuck together in rather unusual circumstances, but they make a good team. He is thoroughly entertaining, and always knows how to lighten the mood. I cant help but like him, and I look forward to seeing him again in the next book.

Scarlet is an excellent addition to this series. I really enjoyed following Cinder and Scarlets plots, and they came together beautifully at the end of the book. The switches between viewpoints are very smooth, and it kept the pace moving and the tension steadily building. By the end of the book I was racing through the pages. I will definitely be picking up the third book immediately!

7651,983,440,"Gigantic 19th century Russian novels are, by now, an acquired taste - too long, ponderous, complicated, philosophical, with too many unpronounceable names and patronymics and place names, and on and on and on...for these times. Yet they top the lists of ""10 NOVELS YOU MUST READ BEFORE YOU DIE"" (I know: if they don't kill you first). And patient, persistent readers discover, by Gyorgi, that these books are soap operas!  Loaded with archetypal heroes and villains, fascinating secondary characters, and filled with vivid lives as they're lived out.

And here, a contender for the greatest of them all, is the story of the ill-fated Karamazov brothers - Dmitri, Ivan, Alexi - and their thoroughly sleezy, utterly unlikeable (except that he's hysterically amusing) father, Fyodor Pavlovich, together with the women who provide much of the story's dramatic tension: Agrafena Alexandrovna Svetlova, known as Grushenka, a ""woman of loose morals"" who attracts the adoration of both Dmitri and his father, and her noble narrative counterpoint, Katerina Ivanovna Verkhovtseva, jilted by Dmitri, loved by Ivan, and saintly...until she's not.

The complex tale Dostoyevsky weaves is at once majestic, timeless, profound - pick a superlative. (Don't say ""excessively slow"" or ""uncommonly boring."" The big Russians have their detractors.) And if you're disinclined to read the entire 700+ pages (in the very small font Dover Thrift edition I read), you ought not wait to read the justly famous chapter, ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" as a stand-alone that continues to astound with its tightening, Bolero-like grip, provocative thesis, and startling conclusion. (In other words, don't wait 50 years for ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" which I read about as an undergraduate but never quite got to.)

Know, however, that every word Dostoyevsky sets down is most assuredly *not* sacred. That is, although some readers may find his superabundant verbiage endearing - I place.myself in this camp -  he's a ceaseless overwriter and a sometimes tedious over-observer. This in turn translates into punctilious overdescription...of locales, feelings, sensations, the behaviors of stray dogs and cats and other critters that wander in and out of scenes, and so on. (But I should qualify this, after all, as overwriting of a superior caliber.)

And, forgive me, I prefer to read fat Russian novels in the generally felicitous translations of Constance Garnett, who knew Tolstoy and wrote in the high style of late 19th-early 20th century English writers. I've read the criticisms of Garnett - nuances of individual authors' styles that melt into a single Garnett English, too many Anglicisms, too fast a worker.and thus getting nuance or details wrong - but the graceful accessibility of the prose and a fearless, yet sensibly assured management of the often Byzantine complexity of these books makes her an easy.choice over other translators. (Moreover, it's the public-domain aspect of Garnett's translations that make her a favorite of publishers like Dover, who pay no use rights, and audiobook producers. And while I'm at it, let me give a shout-out to the late, golden-throated, voice-shifting David Case, aka Frederick Davidson and other aliases, Mellifluous Narrator of the Big Russians Extraordinaire, another automatic choice.)

Please do not be put off by Dostoyevsky (or, for that matter, any of the great Russians). He may not be for every taste, but he has surely earned a place on your literary bucket list - as a storyteller, a close observer and perceptive psychologist, a precursor of existentialism, and a deeply religious writer who has made sense of Christianity - even to an atheist like me - and puts a warmly attractive face on it. There's an entire world here, a 19th Century, self-consciously self-referential Russian one you won't know and cannot imagine, that begs to be explored, and one in which you'll find the full range of human types - beginning with the thickly described Karamazovs themselves - and emotions that, despite vast cultural differences, hum with universal resonance.",1520380800,5

7653,816,1919,"This must be a week for new-to-me authors, as this is another new one for me. Though I have had Linda Howard on my TBR for a really long time, I just haven't found time to fit her in until now. And now I want to go back and read the whole back list! This was a great romantic suspense!

The premise revolves around GO Teams, a secret sect of the government sending highly specialized and trained teams out into dangerous situations to address whatever situation is needed. Unfortunately the teams, and their leader, Axel McNamara, have an enemy in Congress who wants to see them fail in the worst way. So there was suspense and danger at ever angle in this novel.

Jina ""Babe"" Modell loves her job working communications for the secretive GO Teams, until she gets reassigned to be a full fledged team member and learns that she will have to start going out on missions. As somewhat of a girly girl, albeit it with a smart mouth, this is the last thing in the world that Jina wants or is ready for. I loved it when Jina showed up at the training facility and her training was taken over by her big bulky hunky testosterone-filled teammates. They totally kicked her ass and pushed her beyond her limits, and Jina never gave up. I respected the hell out of her, and so did all the guys even if they didn't show it. There were lots of moments in this book where I admired Jina. She took on an almost G.I. Jane sense of determination and grit, and its hard to find fault with that. However I think my favorite aspect of her character was her plucky snarky attitude, particularly when she was cursing under her breath about what nutjobs the guys were.

Levi ""Ace"" Butcher is our team leader and neither he, nor his team, is too keen on being saddled with the sole woman in the program. Levi was extremely tough on Jina, but the dangerous situations they encountered didn't allow for liabilities and it was his responsibility to make sure she was up to par. Levi was a good team lead - he was willing to make tough decisions and always put the team first, even above himself.

This was a slow burn romance as Levi and Jina had this whole forbidden attraction thing going on. They both lit up around each other, but they couldn't cross that line being teammates. This led to quite a bit of prickly and awkward behavior, and it got to the point where they couldn't even look at one another. But the tension was there and building throughout the story, so you knew when things sparked off, they were going to be explosive.

About the first half of the book is spent on Jina's training and conditioning, and damn if it didn't sound fun. I wish I had 6 huge guys to force me to get in shape whether I wanted to or not... so this part was somewhat motivating. Then when the team starts going on missions, the varying dangerous situations kept my interest piqued and advanced the plot nicely. I liked how the building chemistry was intertwined with the action, and some emotional moments were even thrown in as well. Overall, this was a romantic suspense and I'm glad I've finally delved into the world of Linda Howard.

7657,318,1924,"An emotionally charged roller coaster of a read, this book had me going through all of the book feelings! Restore Me is the book I knew was coming, after I read Ignite Me. It is the inevitable storyline that I have been looking to getting my hands on. It's the book I've wanted to read, and didn't want to, all at the same time, because I feared what I thought might happen would come true. Does it ever, and more so. This book is definitely a mixed bag of emotions, and I mean that in the best possible way.

Tahereh Mafi does not hold back in this book. I was torn between wanting to curl  up in the fetal position, yelling 'How could you', and screaming 'No' all at the same time, mixed in with a few 'Yes"" comments as well. To counter making me go through the emotions I knew Mafi would make go through, but didn't want to admit, she also threw in laugh out moments, plenty of hot character chemistry moments, and so much more. Kenji is to thank for the hilarious, laugh out lines, Warner and Juliette some sexy time scenes that may make you blush, and there a few scenes that will either shock you, or have you wanting to doing a fist bump with the characters. Oh this book. It does not hold back, and emotionally spares no reader nor character.

Picking up right after Ignite Me ends, and Mafi waits no time thrusting her readers deeper into the Shatter Me series world. This world is one that is full of shocking secrets, deception, intrigue, danger, and makes you realize that every character is a pawn in a deadly game. The first three books in the series barely scratched the surface of all that's revealed in this book. My word, just WOW! I wasn't prepared for all that or that deadly twist. While some things may be easy to see coming, you can't predict the turn of events that end up taking place. I need the next book!

Writing this book from both Warner and Juliette's points of views, Mafi allows her readers to see the raw vulnerability and just how emotionally and mentality broken down these two characters are. It's sadly no surprise given all that they've endured leading up to this story. It was so incredibly easy to be emotionally sucked into their both their individually journeys as well as their relationship one. They have no many hurdles they've yet to get over, and this book is their realizing just how much stands in front of them. They had me rooting for them to make it through all that transpires in this book. I love how together, they mend the darkness for each other.

This book bridges the gap between a lot of the info that's been hinted at through out the Shatter Me series, and the deception that's already taken place. It introduces readers to a bigger cast of characters we've not yet met before, but who's homes (sectors), we've previously heard of. Their being apart of this story not only links previous withheld history, it uncovers missing links we've previously not had. It also gives readers a stronger history on their ties to Warner, and Juliette. Though I may not be a fan of all of the characters, I liked their roles in this story, and the over all series. There is a purpose for them being in the story.

Oh my word, that ending! I was not excepting that what so ever at all, though I should have. It's SO good! It's completely surprising. I had to re-read twice just to make sure that what I read actually just happened. I need the next book in my hands already. This book is an emotionally packed read. It's one I'm so glad Mafi wrote, and one that definitely fits perfectly into one of my all time favorite series. I need more! On a side note, I love this cover, and the pages of this book (which aren't defective like some reviews have said. They were done that way on purpose; it's called deckle edge).

I didn't have a clue that I was in for such a raw, honest ride about how religion impacts children and how detrimental it can be to try keeping a teen from blossoming into their own bodies and sexuality. I know The Poet X is a love story to poetry, but as someone who was raised in a sheltered, religious home, terrified of my own body and the things it wanted, this is a love story to those kids, too.

""I am the baby fat that settled into D-cups and swinging hips so that the boys who called me a whale in middle school now ask me to send them pictures of myself in a thong.""

 body acceptance 
Every teens path has a few major obstacles, and Xiomaras are her body, and the ways people view her for it. At 15-going-on-16, shes a tall Dominican girl with a thick figure, and she laments the different struggles it causes her  whether its boys (and men) giving her unwanted attention, or her mother blaming her for it.

""When your body takes up more room than your voice you are always the target of well-aimed rumors, which is why I let my knuckles talk for me. Ive forced my skin just as thick as I am.""

 rape culture 
Xiomaras young, but shes already so painfully aware of what rape culture does to the society she lives in. She constantly is harassed, whether its a cat-call on the sidewalk or a strangers hand on her curves, but her experience is depicted so honestly. I think an unfortunate number of women, of all ages, will read this story and relate to the nauseating mixture of guilt and anger brought on by these words and gestures we never, ever asked for  unless breathing in a womans body is asking for it.

""Trying to unhear my mother turn my kissing ugly, my father call me the names all the kids have called me since I grew breasts.""

 love and self-love 
Meanwhile, throughout the struggles of living in this rape culture, Xiomara wants to live, and be happy, and find love. She has a sweet, understated blossom of romance with Aman, a classmate from Trinidad, and even explores the ways in which she can become comfortable in her own skin: learning to see her body as beautiful, not oversized, and discovering what she wants and needs. (By the way, can we please get more books normalizing teen girls who explore their own bodies like this one does? Weve tried this whole girls don't crave sex like boys do approach in YA for way too long, and its clearly not getting anyone anywhere.)

""And I knew then what Id known since my period came: my body was trouble. I had to pray the trouble out of the body God gave me. My body was a problem. And I didn't want any of these boys to be the ones to solve it.""

 abuse 
The other big struggle in Xiomaras life comes in the form of her family, and her mothers religious views. If you are uncomfortable with religion being portrayed in a candid and sometimes negative light, Ill go ahead and say that The Poet X may be one you should go into with caution, as Xiomara does raise a lot of questions about the church, scriptures, and God. She has a hard time coming to terms with the devout beliefs of her loved ones, and the gap between her religious views and her mothers come to blows (literally) throughout the story. There is an honest depiction of parental abuse in this story, and her mothers excuses are consistently rooted in her religious beliefs, which I know may make some of my religious friends uncomfortable, so I wanted to offer fair warning on that.

""When Im told to have faith in the father, the son, in men  and men are the first ones to make me feel so small.""

 religion and women 
Theres also quite a lot of discussion regarding how girls are raised in devoutly religious households, and how common it is that they are taught that their bodies are a stumbling block for the men in their lives. Xiomara finds herself frustrated by the idea that she is expected to carry the full burden of what men do to her body, and muses a few concerns about how absent she feels that God is from the objectification and abuse she faces. Theres also a bit of talk about how queer individuals are treated in the church, as Xiomaras twin brother is gay and closeted, and the siblings feel a substantial amount of terror regarding how hes going to be treated if he is outed.

""And I think about all the things we could be if we were never told our bodies were not built for them.""

 final thoughts 
At its core, The Poet X is a story about overcoming the ideals that our families push upon us, learning how to know who we are and what we want, and loving ourselves when the world doesnt make it easy. Its about family, and the ways that we try to make situations work, and the desperation with which we must remember that, at the end of the day, we have to keep ourselves happy and safe  no matter the relationships it may cost us. Its about body positivity and loving the skin that were in, and fighting back against a society that reduces us to cup sizes and the length of our skirts. It is a beautiful, empowering, diverse, feminist tale, and I will undoubtedly be recommending it to everyone, but especially to any young girls who need to hear that they are whole, they are good, and they deserve happiness and freedom.

7666,1075,764,"I read Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West to fill the prompt of a book that is also a stage play or musical for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge.

This book started slooooooooow. It ended in a bit of a madcap rush, which was odd since the author spent some 400+ densely packed pages between the two points dithering on topics such as social castes, religions, politics, and the nature of evil.

Wicked follows the life of Elphaba, the green-skinned wicked witch, from birth to death. Maguire presents an interesting twist on the familiar story of Oz, but I don't feel like the book ever fully lived up to its potential. There were too many political/social issues that were never fully addressedwhy spend 20 pages writing about issues you're only going to skirt around and never deal with?and many other topics that seemingly only served to distract from what could have been a much more streamlined, straightforward story. Even for an allegorical novel, this seemed like a page-padding ploy.

Also, Maguire seemed to be channeling Lewis Carroll, and taking every opportunity to use obscure words when simpler ones could do (this was even jokingly referred to by a character in the text, who explained that yes, he knew what that word was and that he was using it correctly because he had looked it up). The one redeeming feature of the book was the slightly twisted sense of humor that was present throughout.

I really, really wanted to like this book a lot more than I did, and I can honestly say Ive never more anxiously anticipated someone being doused by a bucket of water so I could finish a book.

This was read to us as children and seemed exciting then. However, the experience as an adult was that I lost interest and struggled to around two thirds of the way through before giving up.

Bilbo Baggins is a Hobbit. His peaceful, lazy life is rudely interrupted when Gandalf the wizard hosts a tea party for dwarves at his home. They are given an assignment; to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the dragon. First, though, they have to find him. So begins an adventure filled with the usual dangers and snares, toil and trouble as they journey to their destination...

Although I enjoyed the earlier chapters and scene setting, I lost interest in the purpose of the journey. The amount of trouble they encountered along the way and the amount of time it took to get out of each situation meant that the thread of the story was lost. It reminded me of a point and click adventure game and felt a bit like the end would never be reached, without cheating.

Apparently, it was the children's version I enjoyed as a child (perhaps, not surprisingly) and not this one. There is nothing harmful here, it is just dull, sorry!",1520380800,2

7671,902,1926,"Allow me to introduce you to my first MUST read book of 2018. If you're a crime fiction fan you absolutely cannot miss this book, its extremely fast paced and exciting, the twists and turns are executed flawlessly and the serial killer is one of the most terrifying Ive ever read about. If you're at all hesitant please share your concerns with me because I promise you, if you start this one I don't think youll regret it for one second.

This is the fourth book in a series following Joona Linnea but you can definitely read it as a standalone as I did as each book in the series seems to follow new cases with reoccurring characters. Speaking of characters, this book had some of the most complex, interesting characters Ive ever encountered. Theyre all multilayered and have fascinating histories, I fell a little bit in love with Joona and Saga. Jurek scared the daylights out of me, I probably shouldnt have finished this at one am when my entire family was asleep but no way was I about to put this one down before I finished!

Much of the story takes place inside a high security psychiatric institution, talk about a creepy atmosphere! There were so many intense, heart pounding scenes that took place inside those walls and they were so well written that I was scared myself. Between the extraordinarily crafted setting and the crisp, precise writing style, I just could not get enough of this one. Ill close by urging you once again not to miss this one, its outstanding!

7675,302,27,"If I Die Tonight by Alison Gaylin is a highly recommended novel of psychological suspense.

Late one night in the town of Havenkill, a washed up 80's pop star, Aimee En, stumbles into the police station claiming that she was the victim of a carjacking. She claims that a teenage boy stole her car and then ran over another teen boy who tried to help her. Liam Miller, the high school football star who tried to help, is hospitalized and fighting for his life. Wade Reed is a school outcast and the number one suspect. As Liam obtains cult-like status, the rumors about Wade increase.

Everything doesn't quite add up, however, and it might not be exactly what it seems to be. The police have some concerns about Aimee En's version of events. There are also questions about Liam and his friends, in spite of the fact that the teenage social-media-finger-pointing-and-shaming-storm is in full swing and after Wade. The story unfold between the viewpoints of multiple characters, including police officer Pearl Maze, Wade's mother Jackie, his younger brother Connor, and Aimee En.

If I Die Tonight opens with a Facebook message from Wade saying that he will be dead by the time people read the message. This sets the tone for the story, since you know that the end result will be this message. The overriding question is, though, is Wade guilty? He's not talking and not defending himself. He was out of the house, smoking, and wandering who knows where that night, but why were the other boys also out in the wee hours of the morning? Why would Aimee be driving around on a cold night with her car window open, and was that alcohol Officer Maze smelled on her breath?

The writing is great and the characters are well done in this character-driven drama. I especially liked the thoughtfulness and logic from Officer Pearl Maze. Jackie was fiercely protective of her boys and this was clearly well-established and depicted realistically. The fire-storm of teens on social media jumping to erroneous conclusions, overstating the facts, following the crowd, making a deity out of Liam, and in general being all emotions with little logic was perfectly captured. And it's not just teens who can be illogical and reactive in this small town.

The plot was relatively fast-paced after the initial set up. Gaylin carefully reveals more clues and information as the story continues and works its way through several contemporary problems and social issues. Astute readers might be able to guess where it is going, but the journey is worth reaching the final conclusion.

But Gilly will never be a media/ book darling and its because she doesnt give the public what it wants and thats one of the reasons I adore her. Its hard to even classify what genre to put her stories in; theres no big reveal or surprise or drama at break neck speed; its more like taking a walk in the woods and admiring each and every leaf and tree and blade of grass that makes up the woods and just enjoying the flow. She writes about subjects that are uncomfortable ( race, inferiority, games people play inside their own minds) and Its done so well; I genuinely admire her work.
This involves two boys Noah and Abdi, Noahs terminally ill and some people see what they think is Abdi rough housing with him one day and pushing him into the water. Detective Jim Clemo is on the case and investigates what really happen that day. I always show my husband a few new books and ask him to pick my next read and he bypassed this one twice I asked why he said looks boring and that is precisely what is so worrisome to me. I think the public might view the title or even the blurb boring when nothing could be further from the truth Gilliam MacMillan writes about what is real; she writes close to the heart and I am forever a fan.

7683,881,1928,"Fast-paced, totally addictive suspense fiction that draws you in from the first lie until the final terrifying twist. Written from Finn and his missing girlfriend's point of view, you learn their past and current thoughts, without slowing down the story.
Finn is troubled he has a shady past that occasionally resurfaces with devasting results, his obsessive love of Layla his missing girlfriend makes him an obvious suspect in her disappearance but his well-placed lies and excellent legal advice leave him free to rebuild his life.  Twelve years later, Finn has moved on, but random events collide to make him believe the past has not done with him yet.
Focusing on Finn, his current girlfriend, a longtime friend and ex-girlfriend, the cast of this sinister thriller is small. As the menace escalates, Finn cannot trust anyone, and this sense of isolation builds his anger to boiling point.
The gripping final chapters reveal an unexpected twist, with horrific consequences for the story's major players. I guessed this before the end, but even then, the ultimate revelation is not quite as I envisaged. For me, part of the enjoyment is trying to foresee the outcome before the story's end.

What Worked For Me
Coming Out  Speak No Evil is many things, but at its heart is a boy, Niru, coming out to a girl, Meredith. The two had long been friends, had dated here and there, and Meredith very much wanted their relationship to be more than just friendship. Niru, afraid, but no longer able to stomach the pain his rejection caused Meredith, admitted to her that he may be gay. There was much to Nirus coming out, most of it painfully sad, but I loved the moment these two shared after his secret first emerged.

She holds me as she murmurs, Im right here. She says, Im with you. I start to cry. Im overwhelmed by the sound of my own pain. She tries to slow things down the way our track coaches slow us down. Count your breaths, Niru, she says. Follow my voice, Niru. And I follow for a moment, but my thoughts are strong and I choke on a mixture of relief, embarrassment, and fear. She pulls me closer and rocks with me. She drapes an arm over me and clasps my hand. She says, Ill always be here. I say, what do we do now?

Clash of Cultures  Niru, born in the United States, had for the most part led the life of any other privileged American teen. He went to an elite prep school, had already earned an early acceptance to Harvard, and enjoyed the usual circle of friends. Niru also appreciated many aspects of his Nigerian heritage. Both parents were born in Nigeria, but had immigrated to the U.S. to build very successful careers and give their two sons privileges they hadnt enjoyed. It seemed he had it all until his father discovered Niru was gay. To his parents being gay was an abomination that had to be exterminated at almost any cost. This clash of growing up in city, in a country where people need no longer be ashamed of homosexuality and a culture where it was completely unacceptable led the reader through a sad and powerful chain of events.

Dual Narrators  Speak No Evil has two narrators, Niru and Meredith, with Niru telling the bulk of the story and Meredith picking up the last third. Much of what happened to Niru in the first half of the story Meredith had little knowledge of and so couldn't speak to. After coming out to Meredith, Niru lost control in his life and to some extent blamed her. The middle of the book was exclusively Nirus story, but Meredith emerged again later and picked up Nirus journey as only she could. Both parts were told in first person which gave the entire story authenticity. From their own vantage points the themes of culture, sexuality, race and ultimately, friendship unfolded.

What Didnt
Formatting  Uzodinma Iweala, like many authors today, chose not to use quotation marks in his book which had quite a lot of dialogue in it. I am used to that now and it doesnt bother me nearly as much as it once did, but Iweala also didn't have line breaks in conversations. As an example, I didn't in any way change the format of the passage quoted above. The lack of line breaks sometimes made for difficult reading and seemed a little lazy.

{The Final Assessment}
Coming-of-age stories are one of my favorite genres, so Ive read many and am always on the lookout for those with a unique twist. A boy coming out in itself doesnt sound all that different, but Iwealas story truly was much more than Id expected. He packed a lot into a slim volume. Both heartbreaking and memorable, Nirus story is one I highly recommend. Grade: A-

In the Red Queen we discovered a world where people are valued based on their color of blood. Either you are a Silver with some sort of elemental magic, or you are a Red with no power. Reds are the largest part of the population but are treated as lowly slaves.

Mare Barrow has red blood, but she is far from ordinary. In book 2 she continues to defy the people who would oppress her and her people.

Was it good?

Ugh. No. I very much did not like this book because Mare was such a self-centered drama queen. A word that rhymes with itch would be an accurate description.

7693,282,1916,"A few years back I read Alexandra Monir's Timeless series and fell in love with the world she created. So it's no surprise that I loved The Final Six, the first book in Alexandra's new series. Combining secrets, life-and-death stakes, and romance, The Final Six is an enthralling journey from start to finish.

The setting and world building were two of the most fascinating parts. I appreciated the level of detail Alexandra put into describing the storms, the challenges the world faced because of them, and the training camp. The setting was eye-opening, chilling, and even a tad stomach churning, because while our climate change isn't nearly this bad yet, it could very well be this bad in the coming years. Honestly, books like these should be a wake-up call.

The Final Six introduces Leo and Naomi, two teenagers from opposite sides of the world brought together by the International Space Training Camp. Leo and Naomi are strong, tactful, and passionate. I found them likable as well as relatable. I also liked that they both had such different feelings towards the training camp and the possibility of being part of the final six.

From the start, Leo wants to be picked. He views it as his second chance, and the thought of not being picked, of being forced to return to his country, makes him even more determined to come out on top. I admired his ambition and positivity. I also loved that while he wanted to win, he didn't distance himself from his teammates. His friendship with his roommate was one of my favorite parts of the book.

Naomi, on the other hand, views being chosen as a death sentence. She doesn't want to be torn away from her family. She also doesn't like the risks the camp is willing to take to make this new planet home. Something doesn't feel right to her, and she's determined to find out the whole story. I'll admit that Naomi's constant stirring of the pot got on my nerves; however, I also could understand why she was so desperate to find out answers, to challenge everything. I'd probably be the same way in her situation, and I did give her props: the girl had some major guts.

The Final Six mostly focuses on setting up the world as well as the training and final selection for the mission. Everything starts of a little slow, because Alexandra does spend a decent amount of time setting up everything, but it never felt boring or nonessential. The training camp provided so many thrills and chills. I loved all the science parts, and I also liked the different authority figures presented. Some of their actions were so incredibly shady, and I was constantly questing their motives.

The only aspect that I didn't outright love was the ending. It felt somewhat rushed and I didn't like how perfectly everything aligned. Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the outcome, but it just didn't seem ""realistic.""

Regardless, The Final Six is an enjoyable series opener, and given the emphasis on climate change, it's also a timely book.",1520467200,4
7694,274,1916,"World leaders have called a state of emergency between humanity and the environment. A plan called the Europa Mission is created to send young men and women to terraform Jupiter's moon in the hope of developing a future home for mankind.

Leo is a survivor of a catastrophic flood in Rome that took his entire family. It is one of many recent apocalyptic disasters affecting cities all over the earth. After losing everyone and everything he cared about, he's lost motivation to go on. However, he's been drafted by the European Space Agency (ESA) to train alongside twenty-three other teens at the International Space Training Camp (ISTC). Only six of them will be selected to take part in the mission to colonise Europa.

Leo believes this will be a chance for him to do something important with his life. While he is excited for the opportunity, Naomi, an American high school student, has a completely different outlook. She has a family and doesn't want to leave them behind, especially her younger brother who she is very close to. She is devastated to have been chosen and horrified by the thought of never seeing them again.

Picked for her scientific genius, Naomi is particularly worried about the logistics of the trip. She questions a delegate from NASA about the Athena - a previously failed mission to Mars, as well as rumours of intelligent life already existing on Europa. The delegate is quick with assurances that there is no cause for concern and tries to assuage Naomi's fears with explanations that sound rehearsed. There may be more to the Europa Mission than is being revealed.

There are many diverse characters in the book and they are thoughtfully written. They have unique abilities and skills which make them highly important to the ESA and the mission. Although Naomi and Leo have different backgrounds, they both come from close-knit and loving families. They have an immediate connection and build a relationship that is integral to the narrative.

The story is fast paced and suspenseful. It depicts tragedy, heartbreak and hope amidst cataclysmic events and the high tech setting of the ISTC. The protagonists are in an unpredictable situation and must take dangerous risks which could lead to either dire consequences or the survival of the human race. The Final Six revolves around a profound and currently relevant subject. This is the first book in a series and I can't wait for the sequel!",1520467200,5
7695,275,27,"Opening with a heart wrenching prologue, If I Die Tonight by Alison Gaylin is a spellbinding mystery about a carjacking that leads to the hit and run of a popular high school student.

Jackie Reed is a single mom raising her  two sons, seventeen year old Wade and thirteen year old Connor, in the small town of Havenkill, NY. Over the past several months, Wade has drastically changed and he is now secretive and a bit of  a loner. Despite these changes in her son, Jackie has complete confidence her son would not do anything to harm anyone. However, suspicion falls on Wade following the carjacking that leaves her sons classmate, popular and well-liked Liam Miller in a coma. Jackie never wavers in her faith that Wade has nothing to do with what happened to Liam, but the other people in their small town are not as willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Police Officer Pearl Maze is on duty the night Amy Nathanson, a washed up musician, reports her vintage Jaguar has been carjacked. She is also a witness in the accident in which Liam was struck by the car thief, but Pearl has doubts about her story. When Pearl uncovers information that proves her intuition is correct, Amy revises her explanation, but is she telling the truth?

Jackies belief in Wade is never shaken but she is frustrated by his refusal to tell her where he was the night of Liams accident. She is already concerned by a puzzling text that was sent to him but she also wants to respect his privacy.  But as the situation becomes more dire since everyone in town is out of blood and Wade is the easiest target, will Jackie try to find answers to the questions that are troubling her about her son?

Younger brother Connor is also deeply affected by the unfolding events. The antipathy toward Wade spills over onto Connor and he is forced to deal with bullies and out of control gossip fueled by social media. He wants to protect his brother and when he becomes a social pariah, Connor makes a decision that he immediately regrets but is unable to take back.

Written from multiple points of view,  If I Die Tonight is a slow burning yet incredibly engrossing mystery. The characters are richly developed and multi-dimensional. The storyline is quite riveting and realistic.  While some elements are somewhat easy to figure out, Alison Gaylin does an outstanding job keeping the truth about who is responsible for what happened to Liam and the perpetrators identity cleverly under wraps until the novels conclusion. A suspenseful and fascinating novel that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy.

Well now I have read it, I can honestly say I absolutely loved it, easily five stars - I read it in one sitting, with a hot drink, chocolate and a big don't disturb me sign!

The pace was brilliant, it gripped me from the outset and I raced through the pages as I NEEDED to know what happened - a great story, well planned with exceptional writing which I have now come to expect from this author!!

Five stars from me - loved it, such a brilliant book and already looking forward to the next book from this excellent author!!",1520467200,5

7702,279,1897,"I really enjoyed Hello Stranger. Ive been dying to know these characters better for a long time. Garrett is one of the first female doctors practising in England and she takes her job very seriously. Ethan is a detective/spy/undercover operative and he takes his job very seriously. Because their work is so important to them, they have both written off the opportunity to find their happy ever after with the one they love. Funny thing about attraction, though, sometimes it cant be denied.

Lisa Kleypas is one of my favourite historical romance authors. Her stories delight my senses and gives me the step back in time that I crave. Its obvious that she does her research and Im fascinated with her mix of facts with fiction. I will admit, there are times I think the heroine is a little too ahead of her times, but I guess, well never know if that is what women thought and felt back in the day.

I loved seeing the strength in both Garrett and Ethan. Garrett uses her mind and confidence in her abilities to show her strength. Ethan uses his physical strength and ability to blend in, to get the bad guys. Both Garrett and Ethan are admirable in their protection and healing of people. Station in life plays no part, they want everyone to be safe and healthy.

One of the highlights of Hello Stranger would have to be West Ravenel. His humour and kindness make him lovable and quirky. I hope we get more of him in the future, Im even guessing that he might be up next.",1520467200,4
7703,923,594,"The first in a trilogy I am eager to read more of, Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy begins boldly with ANNIHILATION.

I still have yet to see the film version, yet have read nothing but stellar reviews.  One thing I can piece together is that Alex Garland's film seems to have much more action and potentially a different ending.  Not a bad thing, as this novel is very introspective and haunting.  What I found most original about the novel is the fact that none of the lead characters use their proper names, just their titles.  For instance, the narrator is 'the biologist'.

There could be a number of reasons for this.  Perhaps the coolest and most chilling is that the current characters are members of the 12th team about to go on the expedition into the unknown and alien territory that has settled on our planet that is referred to merely as 'the shimmer'.  The previous expedition, those who survived, all came back very 'different' and were dead within in weeks of returning. In fact, there is only one living member of any prior expedition this being the biologist's husband.  Being a sci-fi geek and astute reader, I knew that the husband might not really be the same person who left for the eleventh expedition.

Whatever is going on in the portal world the shimmer --- breached only by the appropriately named Tower --- is something out of either a Kubrick film or H.P. Lovecraft story.  The fact that nothing much is explained in the novel makes it that much more intriguing to dive into the rest of the trilogy.  This is smart sci-fi at its finest with deeply layered characters, rich atmosphere and enough scientific mystery to keep the pages turning in sheer wonderment.",1520467200,5

7706,1150,540,"This was my first Francesca Zappia book and I found the story amazing and emotional and the characters touching and relatable. I found myself at a loss for words when I knew I had to write a review because there are some books you can't sum up in a large or small amount of words. The best books make you feel something, even if the book doesn't speak out about impending issues, even if the story itself is just so beautiful you can't help but love it.
Eliza and Her Monsters was one of those stories, I came out of it feeling something. Eliza was such a strong character, very real and very relatable. She overcame some really tough obstacles and faced a lot of pain and came out the other side amazing.
This story seems like it would be about the romance, or a guy swooping in, but it's about a girl with a passion who, in her own way, saves herself.
The romance is very cute and very wonderful and VERY shippable. Wallace has his own flaws but they really loved each other and I loved how even the relationship wasn't perfect. It had its flaws, but at the heart they bother really loved each other.
Gimme a sec her because we have GOT to talk about Emmy. She's apparently 14. IN COLLEGE. And also she's basically a BADASS yo. She's everything I want to be. Like seriously. BEST CHARACTER (maybe) (idk bc they're all amazeballs)
The world felt very real, and I feel like a lot of that was due to Wheelhouse Turn. It definitely added a little character to the town which helped the story SO MUCH.
also I feel like this was extra relatable for me, because I spent ages 9-13.5 dedicating all my free time to an online forum and honestly those were some of the best friends I ever had. It helped me through a really tough time of transition where I moved to a new continent and the people on the forum were all the friends I had. Even though I don't go on the forum much anymore, I still check in, and honestly I don't even know if I'd still be alive right now without that forum carrying me through and pointing me to where I needed to really fall.
SHEESH, THAT GOT DEEP Y'ALL.
Eliza and her Monsters was delectably written, with badass characters, and a story that really hits home

I don't think Ive ever read anything quite like this book before.
It really pushes the limits of the genre, introducing things that are quite alien yet feel of home.
While this book is action-packed, and follows a great storyline, it also focuses heavily on relationships.
I loved the relationship between Bea and Nadim and Zara, as well as the relationship that you could slowly see forming between Nadim and Zara.
Its definitely a book that left me thinking for awhile after finishing it, because its new and different yet beckons of what the future of books have to offer.
This was not just a trailblazing book, however. It features a diverse cast of characters, amazing female friendship, and an unusual romance. The book was entertaining as well as something thoughtful. It balanced the two well.
Its definitely a strange story, but it works. Overall its definitely something Ill come back to, and something Ill be willing to continue in the next installment.",1520553600,4

Oh my. If you read this book you are definitely in for a treat. It's dark and twisted and romantic and complicated and just so, so good. I loved nearly everything about it, from the dynamic of the sisters, to the gifts and familiars and poison.
This book is just so well written and the character are 3D and every word just leaps off the page.
Also---this has multiple POVs in it, alternating between the three sisters. Unlike a lot of books, this was confusing, but actually enhanced the reading experience.
The romance in this story just kept throwing curveballs and I loved that. Honestly the book kept throwing curveballs. Every time things started going well, or just when they calmed down, SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEN NOTHING IS OKAY.
so what I'm trying to say is this book destroyed me so go read it.
But seriously. It's like so good. And if you still aren't sure, EpicReads has a trailer that is amazing so yesssss

7711,455,1836,"Jennifer Egan's 2017 novel, Manhattan Beach, was set during WWII, and a big part of the story took place at a war factory, filled with women contributing to the war effort. The novel garnered great acclaim, deservedly so.

Janet Beard's The Atomic City Girls will appeal to fans of Manhattan Beach as it tells the fictional account of men and women who worked at a real munitions factory in Oak Ridge, Tennesee.  An entire city was created out of farmlands, and hundreds of people were brought there to work on a top-secret project- creating an atomic bomb.

Very few workers knew what they were working on; only scientists like Dr. Sam Cantor, a physicist from California, knew the true extent of what was going on. Sam found himself attracted to a young farm girl, June, whose grandfather had his land taken by the government for this project. June and Sam dated, even though Sam was a good ten years older than June, and much more sophisticated in the way of the world. He was also an alcoholic, and had a temper.

June's roommate Cici was a farm girl too, but she passed herself off as a society girl, from a good family, there just trying to help the war effort. What she really wanted was a rich husband from a prominent family, and she would do anything or hurt anyone to accomplish that goal.

The most compelling character for me was Joe Brewer. Joe was a black sharecropper who left his loving wife and three children behind in Alabama to go to Tennesee to make enough money for his family. Through Joe, his young protegee Ralph, and the young activist Ralph falls in love with, we see a different side to this great society.

The white workers have decent housing, and good food. June is impressed with the food, it's better than she had at home. The black workers lived in cold, damp huts, and they ate rice and beans for most meals.

Buses would pick up the workers and bring them to the work compounds, but the black riders were frequently tossed off the buses to make room for white workers. White married families were able to live together in houses, black families were separated, men in one hut, women in the other. The black workers on construction crews built the homes, but they were not allowed to live in them.

The Atomic City Girls (the title may be a misnomer, we get the male point of view here as well) is strongest when it shows the reader how the war effort worked in Oak Ridge. Workers were constantly reminded not to talk about their work with anyone, and not to write to their families about it. Letters home were read by government officials, and people were encouraged to turn in anyone who violated these policies.

I liked learning about this project, and the photos from the Department of Energy that are  interspersed throughout the book are fascinating. I was less interested in the love lives of the characters.

People who enjoyed Hidden Figures will also find The Atomic City Girls interesting. I recommend it.",1520553600,4

7713,1150,958,"YALL SLEEPING ON THIS BOOK, LIKE WHAT EVEN. I have heard ABSOLUTELY nothing about it yet I cried five million times and it has AMAZING diversity rep.
I just yall. This book tho. I cant even.
I find myself constantly astounded by the books Robin Benway writes. ALSO KNOWN AS was hilarious and adorable. EMMY & OLIVER was hilarious and adorable and beautiful. this one? Hilarious. Adorable. Beautiful. Amazing. Wonderful.
Im not going to say a ton about the rep, as I am a straight, white girl, but I felt it was extremely well written. There are several romances in this story, but it wasn't all romance. I feel like a lot of contemporaries focus so much on romance that we forget that there are other stories to tell. I was promised a hard-hitting tale of what it means to be family and thats what this book delivered, with fascinating characters and many, many tears.
As with most contemporaries, this was a character-driven novel and thats what really shone out to me. From chapter one, they grabbed me and pulled me in. This book made me cry for the first time before I was even 4% in,
I just cant even put into words how hard-hitting this book is.what I love about it is the feeling it gave me while I read, the characters I laughed and cried and grew with, and the victory of watching them grow.
Adoption is something so dear to me, because without it I wouldnt have the best little siblings ever. Its a way I someday want to give a home to a child who needs it. And this book doesnt just show the good side of Adoption, or even just the bad. It shows both and paints a beautiful picture of three different families, what it means to be a part of a family, and how it feels to watch one fracture. This is a book I can guarantee Ill be gifting my siblings someday, because it is so important.
But first, lets talk romance. While it isn't the focus of the story, it is a little side plot which I am a HUGE fan of. We have three main characters, so three main love interests. Mayas girlfriend Claire, Joaquins ex Birdie, and Grace has well she has Rafe, who is my favorite. He was respective and funny and adorable and tbh Im stealing him if thats allowed. All the romances were extremely different, but all very well-written and SO shippable.
Theres so much more I want to say, but I cant find the words to voice how strongly I love this book. You won't understand unless you read it. GO. READ. IT.",1520553600,5

7715,902,27,"THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS THAT PULLS YOU IN RIGHT FROM THE START, IT HAS A POWERFUL PROLOGUE AND THEN FLIPS BACK IN TIME FIVE DAYS EARLIER. ITS TOLD FROM A HANDFUL OF PERSPECTIVES BUT I ENJOYED HEARING FROM JACKIE, MOM TO TWO TEENAGED BOYS AND PEARL, A POLICE OFFICER THE MOST. JACKIE WAS RELATABLE TO ME AND I COULD FEEL HER ANXIETY AND FEAR FOR HER SONS, IT BROKE MY HEART TO PIECES AND THE AUTHOR DID A FANTASTIC JOB AT SHOWING A MOTHERS WORST FEARS. YOU GET A SPRINKLING OF POLICE PROCEDURAL AS WELL WITH PEARLS POV AND SHE WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF COP I LIKE READING ABOUT, FLAWED AND DAMAGED WITH AN INTERESTING BACKSTORY BUT STILL HAS A HEART OF GOLD.

This book scared me and I don't mean that in the traditional sense of the word, it scared me in a realistic way as I can easily see this sort of thing happening in real life. Wade is an outcast at his high school, hes a social pariah and really has no friends. Whens hes the main suspect after his super popular classmate is hit by a car, what little dignity and solitude he had is shattered. Social media played a huge role in this book, much as it plays a huge part in all of our lives daily and showcased the dark side of it and how powerful it really can be. The gossip, speculation and rumors after the small town of Havenkill are rocked by the accident is unreal, the author likens it to a virus, a disease and thats such a great comparison as these vicious rumors infect the whole town and impact so many peoples lives.

This was my first book by Gaylin and Im really impressed, she weaves a compelling story and one that kept my attention the whole way through. This would be a great book club read as it tackles many relevant and current issues such as peer pressure, metal health issues and the negative effects of social media. Recommended for fans of authors like David Bell and Harlan Coben.

Thrust book is a chosen one story, but its so well done you don't even realize it until the end, it has a KILLER slow burn romance.
I keep trying to think of things to say about this book, so you all truly understand how amazing it is, but Im lost for words.
I will say it took a few tries and about 20% for me to really get into this book. But heres the thing: once you get into it, you won't want to stop reading. This has a lot of my absolute favorite tropes. Chosen One(done well), forbidden romance, forced betrothal/marriage to a creepy guy(that makes me sound weird. Idk, I like seeing the heirones get out of that situation)
Also the romance is ridiculously good. Its slow burn, like super good slow burn. Like sit the romance in the back burner to simmer and come back tomorrow slow burn. So. Good. Ansnkxksnhxjksmsnsh. I loved it so freaking much, the relationship is absolute GOALS. G O A L S.
This book went kind of slow, but even the slower parts were very interesting, and then the last 40% is like BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM. Like you won't be able to put this book down. Prop open your eyelids, youll be reading nonstop until you finish the book.
This book has DRAGONS, yall. DRAGONS. and the way they're incorporated is so inventive, and a play on the whole dragon taming trope which I LOOOOOVE. There are a ton of tropes in this story, but somehow it takes a little bit to even recognize them as tropes. They seem very original and were obviously very well thought out and they were just so different!! So good!!
I loved all the mystery and the fantastical little bits, the old stories, and the different ways those came into the story, and how at the end everything connected, it was just so amazing.
I will admit I was confused a lot during the story, mostly at the world and some other things, because I often get confused with epic fantasy. The worlds are so big, and theres so much information, and they are long books, and Im super forgetful so I got kind of confused at several parts, but I did figure it out after a little bit, and the book does explain things really well.
Honestly, this book remind me of one of my all time favorite series, the Tales of Goldstone Wood. This book is an A++++++++ fantasy. its got all the essentials. Slow burn romance, DRAGONS, evil dudes, tropes reimagined in amazing ways, crazy good plot twists, and an absolutely enthralling story world.",1520553600,5

As a conservative and Republican, I wonder if Frum still maintains a receptive audience among those readers. I wonder how many Trump supporters will read this book.

7720,455,1794,"What first attracts you to Marisa de los Santos's novel I'll Be Your Blue Sky is the gorgeous cover- a red butterfly against a blue sky backdrop, with a green plant on the bottom left corner; it's striking.

The story opens in June of 1950 on Edith and Joseph's wedding day, as they enter their beautiful home. De los Santos reveals the home in loving detail, and you can close your eyes and picture each room as Edith describes it, and even smell ""the sawdust and lemon oil and reckless salt wind.""

The home is in a beach town in Delaware, a busy place in the summer, but dreary and desolate in the winter. They have a happy life together, canoeing, photographing wildlife, and enjoying each other's company.

Flash forward to the current day, Clare Hobbes' wedding day. Clare is marrying Zach, a man who appears to be her perfect match. But something is not quite right, and after Clare encounters an elderly Edith on a bench at the wedding venue, she realizes she cannot marry Zach, which at first confuses, then enrages, him.

A few weeks later, Clare gets a letter from a lawyer- Edith has passed away and left her large home to Clare. Why did this happen? Clare only spoke to Edith briefly. Since she at odds, and getting away from her life might be good for her, Clare goes to the house, called Blue Sky House.

Clare learns that Edith used to run a bed and breakfast at Blue Sky, but abruptly left in 1956 after a murder occured in the town. Did Edith have anything to do with the murder? When Clare finds two sets of ledgers hidden in a cupboard, she enlists her childhood best friend Dev to help her investigate.

At first glance, I'll Be Your Blue Sky seems like a typical chick-lit book, two women in different times telling their stories, but it is so much more. De los Santos surprised me with Edith's story, and I found it engrossing and couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

I loved Edith's strength and courage, and her relationship with the town's sheriff was touching. I admit to be a little lost with Clare's family story, there seemed to be so many people to keep track of that I was confused. When I discovered that they were all introduced in de los Santos' previous two books, You Belong to Me and Love Walked In, I immediately went to my Goodreads page to put them on my Want to Read list.

I hope that de los Santos gives us another book with more of Edith's backstory, she is truly one of the more fascinating characters that I have encountered in awhile. If you like novels like Christina Baker Kline's The Orphan Train, give I'll Be Your Blue Sky a try. I recommend it.",1520553600,5

I probably need several more days to properly process what the freak just happened but I THINK I LOVE THIS BOOK MORE THAN THREE DARK CROWNS IDK IDK.
I feel like THREE DARK CROWNS spent a lot of time setting up the characters and the story and the world, whereas ONE DARK THRONE was able to dive in and murder me with feels and amazingness. It didn't have to take time to set things up.

7722,660,1181,"Some readers might overlook this collection because they aren't into short fiction but this collection includes four complete novels and trust me, youll forget you are reading short fiction once you get into each story.

This is a really excellent collection of stories. I hate to compare Joe Hill to his pop (Stephen King) but he has a very similar sense of humor which comes out in his writing. Not surprising really.

I enjoyed all of these novels but my fave is probably the one titled Loaded. A mall cop is hailed as a hero until the full story is revealed. It has plenty to say about gun control and with everything currently going on in our world, this story is timely.

Although I shy away from short fiction, I couldn't help but fall into these stories. Hill delivers realistic characters and has a knack for pacing. I never felt like the stories were too short which is how I sometimes feel with short fiction.

Strange Weather is a good example of short fiction which is also very satisfying to read.",1520553600,4

Shes looking for adventure and figures Wyoming will provide it. But their first meeting didn't go well. After the stage was set upon by robbers, she got out her rifle and took care of them. When she sees more riders coming she shoots at them, too. Unfortunately, the man she hit was her intended

Ms. Jenkins always writes a good story and this one is no exception. Her words flow well and she creates conflict as well as love in her stories.

The doctor was expecting a lady from back east. She was hoping for a love match. No one lied in their letters but meeting each other changes expectations. He has no interest in love. She wears denims and can do much more than household duties. Even worse, she has her own money.

Her husbands mother-in-law hates her and has browbeat the young daughter. Another woman in town wanted him for herself and shes very critical of Regan. But Regan can hold her own.

One of my favorite lines was when the girl asks her new momma if she and daddy were going to jump around on the bed like her friends parents did. Sure, thats what they were doing

With lots of odd relatives and friends, the two grow closer together. Its great fun to watch how they respond to the challenges.

7726,1150,657,"From the start to finish, this book was impeccably written. So much seems to have gone into it and it has turned out a masterpiece.
Beauty and the Beast retellings are hard to write. Books are hard to write. The problem with the Beauty and the Beast is that, if written wrong, can be construed as a Stockholm Syndrome-esque romance. Yet this book turned out, well, amazing. This story is a vibrant, slow burning romance that is unlike any other book I've read.
It's hard to explain without the aide of spoilers, but trust me; you want to read it. The characters fly off the page and the plot and story will keep you reading long after midnight. The tale that Meagan Spooner spins has the darkness of other worlds, the whimsy of a fairytale, and an inventive spin on a tale as old as time.
The beauty and the beast has always been one of my favorite fairytales. I think what always drew me in was that it featured a princess of intelligence. One that didn't get where she was with her looks. She was selfless and well-learned and brave. All of these qualities transferred well to the Beauty in this story. She was willing to do anything to save the people she loved. Face anything, kill anything, live with anything. And while she was beautiful, I think her intelligence was what really made her beautiful.
We need more heirones with the beauty of intelligence.
PSA: THIS BOOK WILL BREAK YOU INTO A MILLION PIECES AND GLUE YOU BACK TOGETHER WITH HAPPINESS AND WILL ALSO GLUE YOUR HANDS TO IT BECAUSE IT WILL NOT LET YOU PUT IT DOWN AND ALSO YOU WILL LOVE IT BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING AND WONDERFUL AND WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE GO PREORDER IT AHHHHHHHH

Having really loved this author's previous two books, I was very excited when I saw she had a new one out. I was even more excited when I managed to snaffle an early review copy. I cleared some space on my TBR and dove right in. All was going swimmingly and I was really enjoying it until about half way through when I paused and said to my brother that I thought I knew where it was going and that I really hoped I wasn't right. I put it aside and carried on regardless. Sadly I was right and even with the author's explanation which satisfied a few of the niggles I had about the outcome, it just wasn't enough for me to really believe in what I had been reading. In fact, I even called the red herring that the author also slipped it, I was actually hoping that this was going to be the real reveal! Looking at other reviews, I appear to be in the minority and I admit that maybe my early guess may have skewed my later feelings and things could have been very different for me had I not seen it coming. But that's how it was and I have to write my reviews with honesty or I am not being true to myself as a reader/reviewer.
It wasn't all bad though, as I said, I was really enjoying it up until I had my moment of clarity. the characters were working well for me, the story was interesting and kept my attention nicely. Actually, the story kept me interested throughout as, ignoring my feelings about the way the book was going, it was still interesting how we would eventually get there and what would happen when we did. Niggles aside, I though the actual ultimate ending was very well done.
It's hard to write much more about the book without being able to qualify my thoughts and feelings. I have tried to put a few things down but invariably they either don't make sense without further explanation, or hint too much about things that are best left unsaid. I will just end on a positive point though. Everything aside, it was a very readable book. I absolutely flew through it - both before and after my epiphany. So I guess I can't feel too hard done by. It also hasn't skewed my feelings about the author and wouldn't stop me reading any of her future books.
My thanks go to the Publisher and Netgalley for the chance to read this book.",1520553600,3
7733,231,234,"Great to finally read this one, Ive read/heard nothing but good about it, and I agree: a fun but scary ride, told as a woman remembering her time before and during the USAs breakdown, as society takes a strange course. Her loneliness and fear, worried about surviving in such a bizarre and brutal environment - it was tense and brooding throughout. Lots of loss and grief here. Some great writing.",1520553600,5

7736,434,1928,"As a major fan of B A Pariss previous two novels, especially The Breakdown, I pre-ordered this months ago, and couldn't wait to devour it as soon as it showed up on my kindle. I was really enjoying it but then at the 70% mark it suddenly hit me what was going on, and I was almost certain I was right, as my theory explained everything, with no loose ends. From that point on things were well and truly spoilt for me, and I struggled to finish, and found it hard to enjoy the remainder of the book. A small part of me still hoped I was wrong, but sadly I wasnt.

But I still give it 4 stars, since if I hadnt of guessed correctly, it would have been a 5 star read. Although I do wonder if there were too many clues, and not enough false leads, and will be curious to see how many other readers figure it out. I do like how in all her books, including this one, the characters who deserve to, do get their comeuppance in the end. Still a fan through-and-through, and will be reading her future books, just hope they're more like her first two, rather than this one.",1520553600,4
7737,784,5,"This is a book club review, with very little summary of the book itself. Our book club read this book as our February book club. Our book club rates books on readability, likability, quality, and of course, discussion merit. Eleanor Oliphant ended up being in our top favorite book club reads of all time, hence the five star rating.

Eleanor Oliphant is a dark comedy about a woman's  journey into finding her path, to opening up, and to facing her emotions/head/past. It's difficult to give a summary of this book that does not include spoilers, which I believe could take away from the beauty of this book. However, due to the dark nature of this book, there may be triggers here for some readers (please see very bottom note with spoiler triggers).

As a book club read, this book rated very high, an 8 of out 10, because of the amount of discussion that came from it. We were truly invested in this discussion - members shed tears, laughed, hugged... it was a wonderful book to discuss. We talked for hours and hours, and eventually ran out of time. We rarely have so much discussion with books that is so deep and meaningful. And everyone agreed that the book was likable despite the dark subject matter. The book is so incredibly funny and sweet, that it makes the hard topics just a bit easier. As far as quality, the book is far from flawless. Individual ratings were the book in general were about a 6, so a bit lower. But as far as a book club selection, the book was a great deal of fun and very worthy of a group discussion.

The book takes place in Scotland, which made for a fun and lively theme, and a Scottish potluck. This book, surprisingly, has a LOT of food mentions, so there was plenty of recipes to select from. Everyone enjoyed eating the foods that Eleanor and the other characters mention in the book.

Overall, this book is recommended for book clubs!

***SPOILER TRIGGER WARNINGS*** I so often get asked for triggers, I just share these for book club reviews now. After all, what may be fine for the individual reader is not always great in a book club/group discussion. But, of course, triggers are also spoilers, so please do not read on if you do not want that. I will also add the disclaimer that none of these triggers were an issue for our book club, and no one had any problems with the subject matter. We include these strictly as a warning for other book clubs. Topics included: Childhood abuse and trauma, murder, death, suicide topics, alcoholism, and mental health issues.",1520553600,5
7738,395,38,"Ahoy there me mateys!  This was an audiobook that I picked up for two reasons: 1) the author previously won the Newbery Medal and 2) it has a giant cat on the cover.

The cat was supposed to be both invisible and magic.  I had assumed that the story would be lighthearted and that the cat and little boy would get into all kinds of adventures.  This book had a way more serious tone.  It was about a struggling boy named Jackson.  His mom lost her job and his dad has MS.  They are poor and about to lose their home . . . again.  His parents continue to treat every situation with an upbeat attitude.  Jackson knows the problem is serious and doesn't know how to make his parents tell him the truth about their circumstances.

Like how Harvey the rabbit is a sign of alcoholism, Crenshaw is a sign of troubled times.  One of the more interesting points of this book is that Crenshaw doesn't magically fix things.  He is more of a sounding board and a solid presence in Jackson's life.  A friend.  Only, in the beginning, Jackson thinks he is going insane because why should he be seeing a giant talking cat that he thought was an imaginary friend he left back in kindergarten.

I enjoyed the fact that Jackson is going through self-discovery and that the cat doesn't magically fix the parents' situation.  The cat is a background personality for the most part and much of his involvement is through flashbacks.  I loved that Jackson had loving parents who did want the best for their children.  I loved silly Crenshaw.  This was a wonderful story, dealing with the effects of poverty, friendship, family, and resilience.  I will certainly be reading more of Katherine Applegate's work.

Side note:  The narrator, Kirby Heyborne, did a wonderful job!",1520553600,4
7739,122,1920,"The Poet X is a standalone Young Adult novel told in verse.

The narrator is almost 16 year old Xiomara. She lives with her parents and twin brother in Harlem.

Her mom is very religious and she makes her do a lot of church stuff. But all Xiomara (pronounced C. O. Mara) wants to do is write poetry in her notebook.

This is such a unique way to tell a story. But I was not sure if I would like it. But the story was very meaningful. And I could definitely understand exactly what the story was about.

Xiomara goes through a lot of stuff that I'm sure a lot of teenagers deal with. And I loved how she expressed herself through poetry. The book is also about slam poetry, which I loved.

The book is a much quicker read than the 368 pages would make it seem.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed this book. Xiomara's mom was definitely extremely tough on her. And that bothered me. However, I thought that Xiomara's teacher was wonderful. And I was fascinated by everything to do with the slam poetry. The book does feature some romance. And that was a nice part of the story. I also really enjoyed Xiomara's brother and her best friend. This is a very original and different way to tell a story. I really liked it!

7740,688,1510,"This was an easy read for me, but I kept hating Angela. I would actually say I cant stop reading this book but I want to slap the main character so bad. I just cant stand weak, trusting women. However... somehow the author managed to pull the plot out of the free fall it was on and save the end. I didn't end up hating it and liked the twists at the end. Still a little unsettled and feel like the conclusions could have been stronger but a good read.",1520640000,4
7741,730,1924,"While its been four years since the last book, Restore Me takes place just 16 days after the events of Ignite Me. We are put back into this world in the midst of Juliette trying to establish her rule as Supreme Commander. This requires her to balance relationships between herself, her friends, Sector 45, and the rest of the world. Unsurprisingly, Restore Me is beautifully and eloquently written. Tahereh Mafis way with words has always been a huge selling point for this series.

The last book ended in a series of rapid events which, I felt, left a lot unresolved. So I really enjoyed the fact that the beginning of this books focuses on resolving some of those issues. This also allows for some much-needed development for certain characters and relationships. This book also features a level of hilarity that can only come from a bunch of teenagers trying to run the county and I am HERE for it.

Unfortunately, Restore Me also brings back one of the aspects of the original trilogy that I loathe. That aspect is Juliettes attitude. Juliette still makes me want to shake her because she doesnt listen! Her actions in this book remind me of why I honestly didn't enjoy Shatter Me. Yes, she was mistreated but so was literally every other character in this book! She always acts like a dramatic spoiled brat and thinks everyone is deliberately plotting against her and it's infuriating.

Overall, I am so excited to be back with Juliette and crew. Im dreading having to wait a year for the next book because this ending is insane! Props to Tahereh Mafi for making it feel like we never left.",1520640000,4

7743,915,704,"I have read all of Anne Hillerman's books written to date and read all of her father's books and I have to say that this is not her best.  I found the assignment given to Chee, guarding a mediator at a conference regarding a development at the Grand Canyon, to be as boring as the conference must have been.  I'm also not happy with the way the characters are developing.  For instance, spirituality and Navajo culture were extremely important to Chee who, at one time, contemplated becoming a medicine man.  This aspect of his life is no longer even mentioned.  It also appears that Anne's books will feature Bernie as the main character but Chee and Leaphorn should not be relegated to lesser positions as they were in this book.  I miss the depth of their wisdom and hope that future books emphasize them and flesh them out.  I do believe that Anne is doing a good job of showing Leaphorn's rehabilitation from the brain injury he suffered in an earlier book which may explain why he appears flat as opposed to three dimensional.

Yet she stays and he staysdrawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him. Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair. Still, each holds something back from the otherdangerous, even lethal, secrets.

  Then someone dies. Was it an accident, or part of a plan? By now, Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each others lives and lies that neither one knows how to get awayor even if they want to. Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them?
  Somethingor someonehas to give.

  Which one will it be?

My Thoughts: From the very first page of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunburn-A-Novel/dp/B0727T88KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunburn: A Novel</a>, the reader is drawn into the mysterious connection that seems to develop immediately between Adam and Polly.

Circumstances brought them together, but desire and the slow burn of secrets and lies would keep them connectedfor one long hot summer and beyond.

Who is Polly? We learn bits and pieces of her life and her past as the tale progresses. Their alternating narratives fill in the story over time. Is she a con artist bent on destruction? Or is she someone with a plan and unexpected goals?

Additional layers revealed complexities I didn't see coming until the very end.

Fascinating story with interesting characters, some of whom were evil and destructive. But I liked both Adam and Polly and rooted for them. Would either of them get what they wanted from the relationship? Would they abandon their original goals? Or would life and someones manipulations throw too many curves for either of them to win? A stunning leap near the end of the story brought some of the answers. 5 stars.",1520640000,5

I can feel the difference in Chee, Bernie and Leaphorn but they are still well written and likable characters.  I didn't like this story as well as I did Spider Woman's Daughter but nevertheless enjoyed the book.  I felt that Chee's assignment in Monument Valley with the movie crew was rather contrived and I was not happy that he and Bernie were working from separate substations.  I hope that future books don't end with Bernie in a life-threatening situation or Bernie and Chee working at opposite ends of the Navajo nation but I will continue reading about the characters I have come to love.

7774,601,1558,"Robert Harriss An Officer and A Spy is a great example of a book that defies a key generality and a personal prejudice.

By definition a novel of historical fiction must be written and read from the understanding that everyone knows the ending. The Titanic will sink, Pearl Harbor will get bombed and Napoleon and the Roman Empire will eventually fall.

Most of us know the broad facts of the Dreyfus Affair. A decade before World War I, the French Army uncovered a spy, what we might now call a mole, within the Army. A Jewish officer, Capt. Dreyfus was found guilty of being this spy, disgraced, sent to a tiny tropical island, Devils Island to suffer a horrendous isolated imprisonment. Later he was exonerated and restored to his rank. Antisemitism as much as any evidence would prove to be the driving force behind his conviction and somehow a letter published by Emile Zola would force France to reconsider the charge. All of this is fairly widely known but very few of us know anything about the specific details. History itself is the spoiler to the plot of Officer and A Spy.

As to my prejudice. Robert Harris has written a meticulously researched version of the people and events leading to Dreyfus reversal of fortune. We are assured that even minor characters existed in reality and were to some degree how they are portrayed. My problem, and it is mine, is that I now know an entertaining version of the events. How much is entertainment and how much is factual? When I do choose to read the actual record, which am I going to remember, the prosaic, unemotional truth, or the dramatic and entertaining fiction? It is to Harris credit, that he will becloud my mind even should I seek to learn the facts.

To some degree the dramatic flow is flattened out by his determination to keep it real. Within this limitation he has written a page turner. Spy is a mystery rather than a spy story. In mood he is compared with the works of Alan Furst. Fursts Night Soldier novels compare in terms of representing good people who accept that they are going to fail, but refusing to stop being good people. The comparison is therefore apt. This is more of a procedural and therefore more like the Le Carre Quest for Karla Novels.

Yes we know the outcome, Harris lays out for us the logical progression that a reluctant, but honorable Col. Georges Picquart, newly promoted and posted to head of French Army Intelligence follows in what becomes for him a search for justice. His every move places him against the interests of the top command, and his reporting Army seniors. The question becomes are these people more worried about their career plans, or in restoring the honor of the Army.

How much of this process is history? We can either do our own research or accept that this is a well told tale. I did have some quibbles about the ability of an Army Intelligence Chief with nothing else to do but to focus on this injustice. Harris makes it clear that there were a number of competing intelligence priorities for his department. But this is a quibble and like my prejudice only my problem.",1520640000,4

7776,532,1073,"A Piece of the World by Christina Baker Kline is a novel which tells the story behind one of Andrew Wyeths iconic painting Christinas World. Ms. Baker is a prolific writer with several best sellers.

Christina Olson lives in a small coastal town called Cushing, Maine. Christinas home is an old farm which has been in her mothers family for generations.

Christina has an unknown disease which increasingly degenerates her muscles, but she fights against it with every fiber of her being. For more than 20 years, the Olson farm has been the subject of artist Andrew Wyeth, a family friend.

I am familiar with the painting Christinas World by Andrew Wyeth, but cant say I have given it much thought. When I heard about A Piece of the World by Christina Baker Kline , I thought it would be a subject Id be interested in, and anyway I enjoyed the book Orphan Train which the author wrote.

This is the story of Christina Olson, not Andrew Wyeth. The artist is a minor character in this story and the famous painting is a culmination of Christinas life and the artists understanding of how she views the world.

This is a charming book, it brings forth the difficult life of an intelligent, but handicapped girl, then a woman, in the 1920s and throughout her life. Combine that with the difficult life of living and working on a farm, a back-breaking work for even the healthiest of people and one sees the painting in a whole new light.

The only call out Id make that after reading The Wife Between Us,  - this is a very similar story line: rich man, beautiful girl, intrigue, deception, etc. However The Last Mrs. Parrish is better executed in my opinion.

Amber Patterson is tired of being an invisible woman who blends into the background. She deserves a life of money and power like the blond-haired, blue-eyed Daphne Parrish takes for granted. In the exclusive town of Bishops Harbor, Connecticut, Daphne who is a socialite and her real-estate developer husband - Jackson, are perceived to be the perfect couple.

The first half ofThe Last Mrs. Parrishis told from Ambers perspective, and while we know that she is manipulative and has a big plan, one that will take her to the new life she wants, there are also hints of a life of secrets she left behind.

When it looks like she is right where she wants to be, things turn around and we see life from the perspective of Daphne... who is not quite the happy woman she appears, in fact her secrets and what she has done to keep them hidden make everything about this story the page turner it is.

The Last Mrs. Parrish is actually confusing at times, as it jumps around a great deal it still works well as a psychological read. The characterisations are strong yet there is just enough mystery and intrigue to keep you wondering...
Be warned: this is no sleeper, be prepared to finish in a couple of sittings or less.

7778,69,1926,"When twenty-three year old Mikael Kohler-Frost, dazed, feverish, and painfully thin, escapes from a captor who held him prisoner for thirteen years, the authorities are stunned.  How did this young man get away when so many others, including his sister Felicia, disappeared, never to be seen again?  The answer can be found in the mind of a demented but crafty villain, Jurek Walter (""he has committed the most heinous crimes of any serial killer in Swedish history), who is confined in a secure psychiatric facility in Lwenstrmska hospital.  He is considered to be so dangerous that he is not permitted to receive visitors or correspond by mail with anyone. One of his most frightening characteristics is his uncanny ability to brainwash anyone foolish enough to listen to his hypnotic voice.

Hoping to find Mikael's sister before it is too late, Detective Inspector Joona Linna and his colleagues decide to send the stunningly beautiful, strong, but emotionally fragile Inspector Saga Bauer undercover. She will pose as a tormented and dangerous mental patient; her superiors hope that Walter will be intrigued enough by Saga to reveal some of his secrets.  ""The Sandman,"" by Lars Kepler (the pseudonym of married couple Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril and Alenxander Ahndoril), translated by Neil Smith, is a tale of sadism, revenge, and unspeakable cruelty.  As long as Walter is alive, no one whom he targets is safe from psychological and physical torment.

Jurek Walter may be a sociopath, but he is also insightful and intelligent.  He knows all too well that when a family's loved ones are suddenly snatched away, those left behind will probably never be whole again. Kepler writes extremely short chapters (this gets a bit irritating) and frequently moves back and forth in time.  The authors also alternate points of view, allowing us to observe plot developments through the eyes of various individuals, including the victims, police officers, and psychiatrists.  As the body count rises, the detectives fear that they may have underestimated their adversary.  This is a graphically violent novel about a superhuman mastermind  at war with law enforcement professionals who, unfortunately, lag behind in their efforts to outwit him.  By the time Joona Linna understands Walter's motive and methods, it may be too late to undo all of the damage that this fiend has inflicted on his victims. Scandinavian thrillers are frequently dark and depressing, but when it comes to brutality and gore, ""The Sandman"" is in a category of its own.  This book will appeal to fans of complex, unsettling, and dark works of fiction.",1520726400,4

7780,923,1510,"Based on the reviews I expected (and wanted) to like this a lot more than I did.  **SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**

This really wasn't anything 'new' as far as plots go.  In fact, I felt at times that I would be better off watching a rerun of ""The Good Wife"", which this novel clearly is mimicking.  Angela and Jason Powell have a rocky marriage at best, made worse by reports of his philandering at work.

The first case is with a young intern and there is no hard evidence and can be brushed aside as 'he said, she said'.  That is until the big bomb drops --- sexual harassment that turned into rape.  Jason has to confess that the woman involved in this separate case he had a brief affair with.  Just when it looks like the NYPD Detectives and Prosecutor have Jason right where they want him --- the woman disappears.

The novel is well written and includes some twists (although one was taken right from a Scott Turow novel).  What I liked best was the use of modern things such as social media which allow cases to be tried on-line and virtually in the court of online opinion well before they make it to any courthouse.  However, the second woman comes up so abruptly on top of the first claim that it was distracting for me.  As the first case is brushed aside in favor of this higher profile one I felt cheated as I wanted to see where the first case might have gone.  If you got my Scott Turow reference then the ending of the novel should be no surprise to you much as it was with me.",1520726400,3

McNamara  With her True Crime blog was a big part of this world and her obsession, shared with many others, to solve the 40 year old crimes of the Golden State Killer is simply fascinating. To say nothing of the techniques used to solve the crimes, the key players involved and just the creepiness of whoever the killer is/was. McNamara is a moving writer and this book will stand as a testament to her and the test of time.",1520726400,5
7783,138,1510,"It seems like the ideal marriage. Success, handsome financial genius who vets companies serving the most disadvantaged in the world and who espouses a business philosophy of success through equality. An attractive wife, a once successful caterer out on the Island, who now prefers life at home caring for her husband and their son. Even, yet, an actual house with a yard and garage in Manhattan. What could possibly be more perfect  in fact, the perfect lie?

Angela is married to Jason, who by all accounts seems like the perfect catch: rich and getting richer doing so by ensuring others in business do the good they promise; a man who married her though she had a child, Spencer; a man who married her though she brought something of a painful past to their marriage. Angela is happiest keeping a low profile, done in defense of her past that involved kidnapping, sexual abuse, and worse. So, shes not entirely pleased when Jason, founder of his own company, prof at NYU, author of a New York Times bestselling non-fiction blockbuster, manages to turn the spotlight on himself. Then, one day Jason drops what at first is a firecracker. A young intern, Rachel, at his firm, also a student of his at NYU, accuses him of inappropriate behavior toward him. Jason professes innocence, which turns into, well, maybe I did something and didn't realize it, which morphs into, perhaps I was caught in my underwear by her while dressing in my office. Angela wants badly to believe in him, wants it so badly shes willing to throw up reasons on his behalf while suppressing her doubts.

Then Kerry steps forward to bring charges against Jason for rape. Kerrys a VP at a firm engaged in water projects in underdeveloped countries. Jason defends himself to Angela by claiming that Kerrys company is guilty of nefarious practices, billing for services not rendered, that he was working with her to bring to light, that somehow she has turned on him. In others words, its all just bad business. And still Angela wants to believe, but finds it harder to do so, and finally impossible when a startling revelation about Kerry and Jason reach her ears and pierce her heart. Then inappropriate sexual conduct and rape devolve into murder when Kerry turns up dead. By this time, NYPD detective Corrines interest becomes ever more intense as she tries to unravel the sexual and homicidal crimes.

Alafair Burke has quite the credentials: daughter of James Lee Burke, former prosecutor, currently a professor of law, and the author of several crime novel series.

She feeds readers information slowly and evaluates the various bits though the eyes of Jason, Corrine, and Angela. She gives only Angela her own voice in first person, thus the title, and readers will be justified in wondering why.

I am really enjoying this series! I love the world, the writing, the characters--everything. Marissa Meyer is very good at what she does. I'm not usually a fan of retellings, but these are amazing! The subtle references don't overpower the story, and you can see how Meyer took a thread from an old fairy tale and made it something new and entirely her own.

Also, the narrator! I know I've said this about her before, but Rebecca Soler is WONDERFUL.

Cinder was about Cinder, and Scarlet was about both Scarlet and Cinder. We see everything unfold from various perspectives, so we know what is happening in multiple places at once. There are so many different layers to these books; hidden nooks and crannies that are not fully realized until all of the pieces fall into place. I cannot stop listening once I start (which isn't good for getting things done).

I loved Scarlet and her no-nonsense personality. She was straightforward and determined in her efforts to find her grandmother. I admired her capabilities (she had no issues pointing a gun at someone's face), but thought she was a tad too eager to throw herself into dangerous situations.

Wolf was an interesting character, and I would love to know more of his history. I think I might get my wish in the next book, if how it ended is any indication.

I loathe Levana. She's vile, vain, and virtually untouchable.

I feel like everything is building toward something catastrophic, and I cannot wait to find out what that is! I'm so happy there are still more books in this series to read!

7799,711,1933,"At the opening of his new novel, CENSUS, Jesse Ball includes an authors note that immediately raises the stakes of the narrative that follows. He dedicates the book to his older brother Adam, who, he recounts, had Down syndrome and died in his mid-20s. Ball writes of his tangled memories of his brother, and of his childhood conviction that he would some day be responsible for his older brother, even though the burden of that responsibility never truly came to fruition. Continuing to imagine that now-impossible future, Ball writes, was the genesis of CENSUS.

The books unnamed narrator is an older man, a widower and successful surgeon whose professional colleague breaks the news that he has a terminal heart condition. Knowing that his time is finite, the narrator quits his job and instead signs on as a census taker, driving north with his developmentally disabled son through a series of towns named after letters and arranged alphabetically. When he reaches Z, the narrator knows his life will be over, and he has arranged for his son to travel back south, to be cared for by a family friend now that both of his parents are deceased.

The towns and landscapes through which the narrator and his son drive in their aged car are dramatic and, at times, hostile. One town boasts a huge rope factory whose workers suffer multiple serious accidents --- sometimes fatal --- daily. Another has been shuttered following a mine disaster. Between towns are marshes and mountains, forests and fields --- strange and sparsely populated territory studded with these small and sometimes unfriendly settlements.

The census itself bears little resemblance to the standard questionnaires with which we might be familiar. Its purpose is unclear, and the census taker is required to tattoo or brand every inhabitant as a way of marking their participation, their very existence. Some, as you might imagine, are fearful or reluctant, while others greet the narrator and his son with hospitality.

As for the census taker, he views his new profession as an opportunity to practice the kind of awareness and observation that was a hallmark of his late wifes personality. She was a performance artist, an unconventional kind of clown, trained at an equally unconventional school --- and upon the birth of their unconventional son, she made it her lifes work to make his life as bearable, as meaningful, even as joyful as possible. I here and now give you permission to live an examined life, the census trainer tells the narrator about the importance of the work he undertakes, beginning now with this moment in which I ask you a question and you, poor soul, may examine your life in the light that it sheds.

CENSUS is a book that resists easy categorization. Its dramatic design and modern, sparse layout seem, at times, at odds with the almost fable- or fairy tale-like quality of its prose. But, in the end, the novel transcends both, becoming an elegiac yet ultimately hopeful story about a mans intentions for his final days and about his wishes and dreams for his son following his death. The sons limitations, the cruelties with which the world has at times pummeled him, make this narrative even more poignant than it would be otherwise. But even though these particulars (heightened by Balls opening story and the family photographs that are included at the end of the book) intensify the emotion, in the end the story told here is a universal one --- about parents and children and families, and finding ones purpose in the wide, at times unforgiving or uncaring world.

Admittedly, I wasn't ecstatic about reading this book. The plot didn't grab me - I thought it sounded too similar to ""The Girl on a Train"" - and yes, it had ""woman"" in the title. There are too many books out there with ""woman"" or ""girl"" in the title for me, all with similar plot lines.

In ""The Woman in the Window,"" Anna Fox is a child psychologist turned recluse after a traumatic event involving her husband and young daughter about ten months ago. She spends her days indoors, spying on her neighbors, taking photos of them, and watching old noir thrillers. Her days also consist of mixing prescription pills with copious amounts of wine, something I found tiresome after a while. It was mentioned one or two times on every page, and I didn't need the repetition.

One day, the Russell's move in next door. Alistair and Jane Russell with Ethan, their teenage son. To the outside, they look like a picturesque family. One evening, as Anna watches them, she sees something she is not meant to see, setting off a chain of events? Did she really see what she thought she did? Or was it a figment of her imagination?

It took me a while to get into this book. I kept powering through because everyone I know insisted that it was a great read. I feel like it wasn't until page 300 that I became to feel invested in it. I didn't feel much for the characters and Anna was, well, she was annoying. I couldn't tell you if I liked the novel but I'm glad it's done, which I feel isn't a good sign.",1520812800,3
7801,674,17,"Ash is convinced no woman will ever want him or love him, who wants to be intimate with a monster? He has convinced himself that his physical scars will repulse everyone, especially any potential love interests. Emma sees the man behind the horrific scars and finds herself falling for the stubborn aristocrat.
Emotional attachment isn't part of the deal though. Not according to the deal the two of them have agreed to. It includes an heir to the dukedom, a lot of teasing, and definitely under no circumstances shall there be any kissing. Not an easy task when you're in the throes of passion.
The Duchess Deal has an equal amount of passion and playfulness, including a house full of scheming staff invested in Emma and Ash, and their very peculiar relationship. At the same time the read is hotter than a chilli pepper. An excellent balancing act of charm, wit and desire.

Lovers of Regency romances want to experience the moments of illicit passion, the moments when there is a sharp intake of a breath just before the feisty beautiful woman is kissed passionately by the debonair gentleman. There are some authors who also manage to infuse the wicked and the saucy with a sense of humour, and that is the core essence of a standout Regency novel. Tessa Dare certainly knows how to combine the hot and heavy horizontal tango with a quick witted humorous dialogue.
Instead of relying on all of the usual clichs and the sometimes stuffy repertoire of this genre, the author has fun with the characters and the plot. This sense of adventure and joie de vivre can be felt throughout the book. Tessa Dare elicits amused snorts and accelerated heartbeats in equal measure.

My wife and I always spoke of making a trip together to show our son the country, but it never came. For one reason or another, it never came, and so I felt when my wife passed, when the idea rose in me about the census, I felt finally it was time to take out the Stafford, to drive the roads north. In her death, I felt a sure beginning of my own end  I felt I could certainly not last much longer, and so, as life is vested in variety, so we, my son, myself, we had to prolong what life we had by seeing every last thing we could put our eyes upon.

Census is the seventh novel by American poet and author, Jesse Ball. In his introduction, he explains the dedication to his older brother, Abram Ball, who had Down syndrome and died, aged twenty-four, in 1998. The surgeon and his son travel north in their (unnamed) country from City A to the town of Z in their Stafford Carriagecar, taking the Census.

In that role, they meet a large number of people, many of whom are welcoming and hospitable, whilst some others are quite the opposite. The surgeon asks his questions and hears many stories, some first-hand, others more removed. Most are kind to his son but: It is easy for humans to be cruel, and they leap t it. They love to do it. It is an exercise of all their laughable powers.

The father notes that his sons behaviour is not always easily explicable, but I have never sought to change what is essentially to my eyes, a basic resourcefulness that finds at any moment something profound. My wife was of the same opinion, but surely we did suffer for it. The long apologies we would have to give to the legions of helpers. But strangely, no one was ever angry about it. People became fond of him very quickly, and that has always helped.

A couple with a now-deceased Down syndrome daughter told him: There is a kind of understanding that can grow in a place, and then everyone, every last person can be a sort of protector for them. This is a thing she can confer on others  a kind of momentary vocation, and that is a real gift Some people were cruel to her, but here, something grew. It was a fine place for her to live, and when she died, she was missed

There are no quotation marks for speech, which may annoy some readers, although any speech is usually apparent from the context. Similarly, for almost three quarters of the book, characters are not given names, and are distinguished only by descriptors: my wife, my son, a boy, the man, the doctor, an old man. In a way, it reflects on the anonymity of the census and is partly explained by the fathers musings on our desire to name things.

Where Ball has the father saying we felt lucky to have had him, and lucky to become the ones who were continually with him, caring for him it could not be clearer that this is what he and his family felt for his brother. This is a wonderfully moving tribute to an obviously loved sibling.",1520812800,5

7805,464,1892,"When introduced to Sophie, life as she knew it is changing, dramatically. Granddaughter of a Viscount, she is being left at a school as he wants nothing to do with her, but family obligations require him, as her guardian, to see to her. Having spent all of her life to this point with her parents and hearing only negative things about her fathers family after his marriage for love to the French opera singer, shes seeing the worst of her fears come to light in her grandfathers anger, brusque nature and dismissive treatment.  The school did, however, bring her two friends who hold her secrets closely, support one another, and meet regularly for tea and catching up. In fact, it was one of her friends connections that found her a position as a companion right out of school, and a small bequest from that lady allowed her to set her plan for self-support and independence in action.  Now, some 12 or 15 years later, Sophie is making her living from gambling: carefully calculating odds, using her skills to quietly build toward a nest egg that will allow her an annuity or an enticing dowry.

Jack, Duke of Ware inherited the title at just twenty-four, and felt the weight of expectation, his mothers censure and his brother Phillips intractability since the beginning. Measured, near anti-social, and wholly consumed with the responsibilities and requirements of his position, yet another debt that Phillip incurred and cant pay while gambling at Vegas, a private club known for members discretion and the surety of debt repayment.  Since Jack won't allow the censure or talk, he pays off Phillips debt, and demands he not return to gamble.  But, Phillip isn't about to be told, and his fascination with Sophie brings him back  demanding she pay attention to him and gamble against him. Finding Phillip satisfactory as a friend, but wholly unsuited as more, including a gambler with his reckless disregard of skill and odds, no one is more shocked (or frankly, threatened) by Wares outrageous demand: a five thousand pound wager if she wins, a week with Ware should she lose.  Of course, shock, anger and the little devil on her shoulder tweak her into taking the bet, and soon she is being whisked out of the club with the Duke, and driven out of London with nary a word.

Oh these two are lovely! Wares first love used and abused him badly, so hes convinced that while marriage is necessary, his will be one well-made with all thoughts to convention and a proper Duchess, not entertaining thoughts of love.  Sophie has kept her ties to the Makepeace name a secret: her parents married for love, but shes hoping for esteem, stability and security: she wants to marry but those concerns come first.  Shes never thought of herself as desirable to a Duke or other member of the ton, in fact a solid middle-class opportunity would suit her perfectly.  But the chemistry between them sparks something between them: soon Jack is seeing the world through her eyes: her quick wit, her intelligence and her pointed questions all have him reeling. More importantly, hes unable to not wonder about her, think about her.
Together, the two are electric, and moments between them shine until the return to London with a vow to never see one another again.

Sure enough, not a full week has passed before the temptation is too great: neither was happy alone, and while Sophie doesnt believe that this affair will lead to more than her broken heart, the comfort, excitement and enjoyment in her time with Jack (and his with her) have them spending more time together.  Surely when Sophie reveals (to one of her best friends) her love for him, and his meddling mother again tries to bend him to her will, the heartbreak is eminent..

A wonderful start to a new series, with a lovely tease for the next title that features one of Sophies best friends.  Love, obligation, choices and family lost and found all play in nicely with a moment where Sophies reactions come solely from her hurt and heartbreak, nearly tearing the two apart forevermore.  The growth of Ware from the tamped-down unemotional man wholly consumed with his responsibilities and title to his emotional awakening and recognition of the need for balance (and Sophie) in his life is wonderful, even when he missteps, his willingness to take a chance, seek advice and ignore his pleading and meddlesome mother are brilliantly shown and made this a read in one sitting title that has me anxious for the next.

7806,711,1901,"ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK is a true crime classic for the 21st century. In a gripping 328 pages, Michelle McNamara chronicles a sprawling list of heinous crimes committed in California during the 70s and 80s by the Golden State Killer, a moniker coined by the author. At least 50 rapes and 10 murders have been attributed to this individual, who to this day has never been caught. Aside from trauma, loss and shattered lives, the responsible party left little behind --- nothing more than a few cryptic, tantalizing clues that have stymied investigators and amateur sleuths alike for decades. And despite a rap sheet that rivals some of the United States most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer remains relatively unknown. Until now.

With ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK, McNamara has converted years of painstaking research into a compulsively readable account of the people whose lives were transformed by a monster, and the race against time to bring him into the light.

His identity matters not a whit to me. I want him captured; I don't care who he is. Looking at such a mans face is anticlimactic; attaching a name, even more so. We know what he did; any information beyond that will inevitably feel pedestrian, pale, somehow clich. These words belong not to McNamara but to author Gillian Flynn, who has written the  introduction to ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK. What I found so particularly striking about this statement is just how well it sets the tone for the book, encapsulating the pathos McNamara brings to the investigation. This is not to say that she isn't consumed by the mystery that surrounds the killers identity. Quite the contrary: she is so consumed that she confesses her anxiety over her all-encompassing obsession with this case to the reader multiple times, worrying over it to the point that she remarks on how certain aspects of her hunt for the Golden State Killer mirror his inability to control his urges to stalk and terrorize.

The very premise of the book hinges on unmasking the villain. However, the empathy McNamara has for the victims and those who have dedicated their lives to investigating the Golden State Killer weaves a humanizing sensitivity into horror that, in less capable hands, could be easily exploited for shock value. Of course, the focal point of ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK is solving the great whodunit, but the books true significance lies in its treatment of the people who find themselves connected to the perpetrator, whether by choice or by circumstance. The end result deglamorizes the myth of the serial killer and helps deliver at least some power into the hands of those who want him to see justice.

ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK is very nearly perfect, and if McNamara had lived to complete it, I can only imagine just how incredible it would have been. Sadly, she passed away unexpectedly in 2016, and it was left to her lead researcher and a close colleague to take on the daunting task of finishing her work. Though they do an admirable job overall, its hard not to see these posthumous chapters as lacking. I missed McNamaras effervescent writing style and found the density of some pages difficult to engage with. Still, her collaborators manage to maintain the spirit of her investigation, which happily carried me through the book until its end.

I absolutely loved ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK. Its a must-read for any true crime fan. Upon finishing, I only wish that the world could have been fortunate enough to have received more work from this brilliant woman. But perhaps with this book, she has given us one final gift: the chance to one day see the Golden State Killer behind bars.

7807,145,1639,"Kate Andersen Brower was once the White House correspondent for Bloomberg News.  While there she got invited to a luncheon of First Lady Michelle Obama's and noticed the butlers quietly moving about in the background and became interested in them and them and in the rest of the staff.  Getting former staff to talk to her (she only got one current member of the White House residence staff to talk to her) proved to be a difficult task.  They were fiercely loyal even after all these years.  Some refused to say a bad word about any of the first families no matter what.  But Brower would get them to open up and once they found out that others were talking it made it easier for them to talk.

The resident staff is the utmost in efficiency. This is most evident when moving one president out and one president in.  The outgoing president has the House until noon on Inauguration Day and the new president will be back at the House at around five o'clock. In this amount of time, they will have moved out the old president and arranged everything of the new president's according to the president decorator if he has one and overseen by the social secretary.  The  Obamas would be the first to hire a man for the position of social secretary in 2011.

Other firsts include the first African-American Chief Usher which went to former Coast Guard Admiral Stephen Rochon in 2007.  In 2011, the position became another milestone when the first woman and second African-American held it.  The Chief Usher oversees all of the over 90 executive resident staff.  Each office has its own head, such as Head of Housekeeping, Maitre D' who is the Head Butler, Head Florist, Head Chef, plumber, electrician, painter, etc...  You don't apply to get a job at the White House. You get recommended by someone who works there.  There are generations of families who have worked there.

The staff lives to serve and become exacerbated when the First Families won't let them.  However, they understand and enjoyed when Chelsea wanted to learn how to clean and cook on her own and looked to them to teach her.  First Lady Michelle Obama insisted that Malia and Sasha make their own beds and do their own laundry and her mother wouldn't let them anywhere near her unmentionables so she did her own laundry too.

Basically, the George H.W. Bushs were looked upon the most favorably. They seemed to truly care about the staff as people--asking about their personal lives and insisting they go home at an early hour so they could spend time with their families.  Nancy Reagan made the Head of Housekeeping quit for a while because she couldn't handle her angry tirades and her strict perfectionism and nearly impossible requests.  The Clintons drove the Curator nuts because they kept moving furniture around and it has to be recorded at all times.  There were also some heavy fighting where there was blood on the sheets in the morning from when Hillary had clocked Bill with a book in the head.  Johnson had an obsession with the shower needing the pressure to be hard and the temperature to be hotter than hell. It caused one of the staff to be hospitalized due to a nervous breakdown he was having such a hard time making the shower just right for the president.  Pat Nixon didn't want the staff to look at them when they were in the room so they would have to turn their bodies away.

This book looks back at fifty years and ten presidents who came and went while the resident staff stayed on taking care of the House and its every changing occupant keeping their secrets.  Brower interviewed over a hundred resident workers, presidential aides, and first family members to write this wonderful and well-researched book.  I really loved this book and it's behind the scenes look at how the East Wing of the White House is run.  I found it touching how close the staff could sometimes be with the first family.  Doorman Preston Bruce was asked by Jacqueline Kennedy to be with the family at the funeral and graveside of John F. Kennedy.  Chief Usher West meant so much to her that she asked Nancy Reagan if he could be buried in Arlington and he was.  When James Ramsey, a favorite butler from the Carter administration to 2010 died in 2014 Laura Bush spoke at his funeral and letters from both Presidents Clinton and Obama were read aloud.  This was a fabulous read and I highly recommend it.",1520812800,5

If you like Greek mythology, The Lightning Thief is an amazing book written by the #1 New York Times bestselling author Rick Riordan and is based on Greek mythology. Percy is a twelve-year-old boy who has dyslexia, ADHD, and is a troublemaker. However, he imagines a lot of things. For example, he imagined his pre-algebra teacher, Ms. Dodds, when there is no teacher that has that name. Another key event is when Percys mom takes him to the same beach where his parents met, and something bad happens. A strong storms comes, and the Minotaur takes Percys mom. Percy has to try saving his mom, and killing the monster by going into the water, and using the lightning bolt. The problem is that he is by himself trying to fight the monster. The moral of this story is that with every choice you make, you become more like yourself. According to the text, it says three days later, he wakes up in the infirmary of Camp Half-Blood, where Grover and Mr. Brunner tell him that he is a demigod, half-mortal and half-god. I think this book is an excellent and interesting book to read. I think that because there is a lot of descriptive details and fascinating information that makes you read on. I would recommend it.

For her to survive on this island she has to do everything on her own but you are going to have to find out what happens to see if she survived on her own.

7812,711,1923,"Elizabeth J. Church has a real talent for developing memorable female protagonists, whose personal journeys of transformation and self-discovery play out against vivid historical backgrounds. In her first novel, THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF LOVE, she depicted an aspiring scientist whose career aspirations are stifled by her husbands work at Los Alamos during the era of developing the nuclear bomb. In her second book, ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, Church again brings to life the American Southwest in the middle of the 20th century. This time, however, the backdrop is not the isolated canyons and secret labs of Los Alamos, but the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas in its heyday.

Churchs protagonist is Lily Decker, who, when readers first meet her, is a child growing up in Salinas, Kansas. Following the horrific death of her parents and sister in a car accident (from which Lily walked away unscathed), shes being brought up by her emotionally withholding aunt and her sexually abusive uncle. Lilys only trusted adult is, surprisingly, the man who killed her family, a military pilot she calls simply the Aviator. He fosters Lilys love for books and, especially, her passion for dance, at which she excels. As high school graduation approaches, Lilys dance teacher supports her decision to forego college in favor of a dance career, and she advises Lily to bypass New York or Hollywood and head straight to where the action is: Las Vegas.

Its 1967, and Las Vegass glamour and bright lights offer ordinary folks an escape from the mounting tensions of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. At first, Lily is entranced by Vegas, but she soon grows disillusioned when her first two auditions result in a quick dismissal. One producer pulls her aside for some advice: with her looks and voluptuous figure, a career as a showgirl, not a jazz dancer, will be the road to success for her.

Lily soon overcomes her reluctance to dance topless, especially when she starts collecting her generous paychecks, not to mention the gifts from admirers. But even surrounded by friends and showered with money and adoration, Lily (now known as Ruby Wilde) feels like something is missing --- like her childhood has irreparably damaged her in ways she cant even fully articulate or comprehend.

ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is a novel that is sexy and enticing, with its lush descriptions of Rubys showgirl lifestyle and its celebrity cameos, but it also is full of issues to discuss and think deeply about. Vegass glittery faade masks so much, not least the significant historical events happening elsewhere in the country and in the world. The rift between fantasy and reality --- and how that divide affects Ruby --- is one underlying theme, as is the complicated relationship of women to their bodies and the tendency of abuse to resurface and recapitulate in various ways.

In the end, though, Churchs novel is uplifting, especially as it subverts expectations and shows that there is still, for Ruby/Lily, a chance for recovery and an opportunity to celebrate different kinds of love and different sorts of families. ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS sheds a different kind of light on a young woman whose value and purpose go far beyond her pretty face.

7815,1080,234,"This is my first Margaret Atwood book. For how short it is, it took me a long time to read, but with this book, I think its better that way. Its provocative and thought-provoking, and I know the messages in this book will stay in my mind for years to come.

In short, this novel follows Offred, a handmaid to a Commander in the Republic of Gilead. Her role is to bear the Commanders child for him and his wife, for if she cant, she will become an Unwoman. Handmaids are not allowed any freedoms once embraced by women: they are not allowed to have families, jobs, money of their own; they are only permitted to wear red dress; they cannot talk amongst other handmaids or secure friendships; they are not allowed to read or write; and it is forbidden even to think for themselves. The Republic of Gilead spawned from a world that used to be our world when the government tried to eliminate all of the immoral and sacrilegious acts from society, but the ramifications of that action were the abolition of many liberties that currently go unappreciated, including the independence of women.

I didn't have any idea what this book was about before I started it. I chose it at random from a list of all my unread books, and to be honest, I was a bit hesitant to read it at first. Literary fiction isn't usually my thing, and I struggle with books that are supposed to be read in school. This is one of those books that is rich with meaning. I do wish I could attend some kind of seminar that discusses this book in complex detail so I could delve further into its meaning and purpose because I want to know more about the concept behind this novel. I loved this book, and I want to share my ideas on it with others. I don't think Ive ever wanted to discuss a literary work more than I do with this book. My copy is pre-owned, and it came with highlighted passages in it, but no handwritten notes. I kept finding myself wondering why its previous owner highlighted some of these phrases, and what secrets do they hold that Im not able to see. I highlighted some passages of my own, but Im still curious what treasures this books previous reader found that I wasn't able to see.

Something I did notice was the significance of the colour of clothing. All the handmaids wear red, a colour of blood, of sin, of lust. All the Wives wear blue, a colour of elegance and status. All the Aunts wear brown, a colour of wisdom and maturity. All the daughters wear white, a colour of purity and innocence. All the Marthas wear green, a colour of subservience and cleanliness. And all the Econowives wear stripes because they have to fulfill the roles of Wife, Martha, and handmaid.

When I read a dystopian, the most important thing to me is to learn how and why the world got that way. I cannot read a dystopian and believe that a world without government or with a heavily corrupt government just happened. At the start of this book, I was worried because I was particularly interested in the why of this story, why the world was how it was, but I didn't think any of it would be explained in this short novel. I was wrong. Snippets here, pieces there, and by the end we have the whole backstory, the how and why of this society. I like how Atwood drops bits at a time, not info-dumping all at the beginning, still leaving the reader wondering from chapter to chapter. Another critical element of dystopian novels is that the how and why have to be plausible; I have to really believe that X, Y, and Z could happen to create this kind of society. And in The Handmaids Tale, the backstory is believable enough. I think its a solid and well-thought-out reason for 1985, when the book was published, but looking at it in 2018, it feels a little bit less reasonable, but just a little. With the progress weve made today as far as gender equality and equality in the workforce, Id really be surprised to see something like this happen. But I guess thats the point of a dystopian world, that its surprising and unexpected nonetheless. I did really like the reasons provided in this book, though, and they did help me to understand the world better.

Atwoods writing is very distinctive, probably indicative of her specific style, but I haven't read any of her other books to note the similarities. She has a way of capturing the nuances of the world, details that most people overlook but are a part of everyday life, and I love the way it almost slows down her storytelling, adding in extra bits of information that only add to the imagery of her novel, making the reader focus on specific items and memories. And her writing is in a stream of consciousness style. I don't know that Ive read too many books written like that, but I like it. My mind jumps around a lot, and I can appreciate the quickness that this stylistic choice gives the story, almost like an impatience to say everything on Offreds mind before its too late.

Something interesting is that much of the story is written without quotation marks. It seems like this dialogue is what Offred is thinking in her mind, or what happened in the past, and then when actual quotation marks are used, thats whats actually happening in the present. I wish I knew why Atwood chose to write like this because its a unique choice. I feel like not many authors could pull it off so effectively, so grippingly. Ive read one or two books before that don't use quotation marks, and I just get irritated that I cant tell who is talking and when. The Bible does that too, omitting quotation marks. I just don't like feeling confused about when dialogue is taking place, but in The Handmaids Tale, its evocative; it works without being confusing.

There are also countless comma splices in this book. I don't know how she was able to get all those misused commas past an editor, but somehow I think each incident was deliberate, a point of style. This technique almost never works without creating deep agitation within me, but here I liked it. Margaret Atwood is a writer unlike most, able to make stylistic decisions that other authors wouldnt dare try for fear of seeming unintelligent or uneducated. I don't know how she pulls it off so well.

The Handmaids Tale reminds me a lot of Orwells 1984, which I loved, and I think thats one of the reasons I enjoyed this book so well. I like the premise of a futuristic depressed utopian society thats controlled by the government, even down to peoples thoughts. Its as if the government is a cult. Its terrifying to think about, but thats what makes it so interesting to read about.

I would be petrified to live in this world, especially since I take a lot of pride in my virtue. I would be one of the women to prefer death to this lifestyle. I find it intriguing that all the ways for one to commit suicide have been eliminated in this society, yet the threat of death hangs over the citizens heads with every action. You cant kill yourself, but you can commit some crime and find yourself dead just the same. I love how Offreds every thought ultimately leads to suicide. Everyone is fooled by happiness in this world.

Hes said a forbidden word. Sterile. There is no such thing as a sterile man anymore, not officially. There are only women who are fruitful and women who are barren, thats the law.

This book made me angry, but not necessarily in a bad way. More like an angry that pushes people to take action. How can women be treated this way, perceived as naught but for bearing children, worthless, submissive, two-legged wombs, thats all? This book turns readers into feminists. How can it not? When you're forced to come face to face with the darkest issues that plague your society, you are forced to have an opinion on them. And any person who understands the value in all human beings will see how screwed up the world is in The Handmaids Tale, but they will also see how much it parallels our own world, even thirty years after its publication.

One of the best parts of this book was its ending, more specifically its historical notes post-ending. After the actual ending was left somewhat open-ended and left me wanting more, I read the historical notes on The Handmaids Tale. This fictional symposium transcript illuminated a lot of answers and details on the story, and it put the events directly happening to Offred in a bigger light spanning centuries. Readers were able to see the effects of this society on a later generation, and, most importantly, the events that led to the corrupted government rule present in this book. What was the most astonishing to me were the events listed that forced this society into creating the Republic of Gilead are events happening right now in our world. I cannot explain it even close to the way Atwood portrays it in her book, but the last ten pages of the novel were definitely the most eye-opening for me, and they gave the entire story a whole new meaning.

I cant wait to watch the movie and the new tv series. I hope they just expand on this world in a deeper way. I also am looking forward to reading more books by Margaret Atwood, who may be a newfound favourite author of mine. Im very curious to see how her writing compares across all her works because the writing was my favourite part of this book.

I avoid looking down at my body, not so much because its shameful or immodest but because I don't want to see it. I don't want to look at something that determines me so completely.",1520812800,5
7816,319,234,"I love dystopian future novels and this fits the mold.  What I really liked about it is that it didn't seem that wildly out there.  Pollution has made fertility rates go down?  Check, that is already happening.  Environmental disasters have made certain parts of the US unlivable?  That has happened to.  The government is overthrown by a conservative religious group that forces woman into subservient roles based on their uses to society?  It hasn't happened yet, but it eerily feels like it could.  The book seemed like it could happen any day, unfortunately even more now so in our current political climate.

This book provided a lot of discussion at book club and even better, most members actually read it this month! What I thought made the novel was the historical note at the end that discusses that the entire book were tapes that were found a couple hundred years in the future and give slight details to think about what could have happened after Offred is lead away at the end of the book.  Im usually not a fan of ambiguous ending, but the historical note really made the novel for me.

We also talked about how easy it would be to take away womens access to their finances and jobs these days, even more so than when the novel was written in the 1980s.  We also talked about how women were banned from reading and the Bible was locked up.  Its easy to take things out of context and force it on people when they are not allowed to read and think for themselves.
I thought it was very interesting that the wife in the situation,  Serena Joy,  was a very vocal advocate of conservative values that were adopted by the new regime.  Offred wonders how Serena now feels living by these traditional values and not allowed to go out and live life in the world like she used to.  Its an interesting thought  telling others to do something and then having to live it yourself are two very different things.

My husband and I started the Hulu series The Handmaids Tale and are about half way through it.  We have limited time watching TV with no kids around so we are very slow at making our way through adult programming.  From what weve seen the show follows the book very well and is very well done.  Any show watchers out there?  What are your thoughts?

I also liked the new forward by the author.  It gave great insight into the novel and also how it is still very relevant in todays society.

Favorite Quotes:

The street is almost like a museum, or a street in a model town constructed to show the way people used to live.  As in those pictures, those museums, those model towns, there are now children.

If its a story Im telling, then I have control over the ending.  Then there will be an ending, to the story, and real life will come after it.  I can pick up where I left off.  It isn't a story Im telling.

They show us only victories, never defeats.  Who wants bad news?

But who can remember pain, once its over?

Overall, The Handmaids Tale is a book that I will be thinking about for years to come.  It is a haunting look at a possible future that I hope we never see.  Its also a great book to use for discussion at a book club.

7817,1153,283,"A lot of interesting things happen in a gorillas lifetime.  You would usually hear about this in a third person point of view, but what if you read an autobiography of a gorilla in first person?
The One and Only Ivan is a story about a gorilla named Ivan, that lives in an animal exhibit at a mall.  Off of exit I95.  He lives with his friends Stella the elephant and Bob the dog.  You would see what the life is like through a gorillas eyes.
  Ivan the gorilla, the main character, is not your usual gorilla. He loves to paint, draw, and sometimes, he even tries to write.  Stella the elephant is Ivans neighbor and is a kind, wise, and gentle character.  Bob is a terrier who is very impatient and sometimes unkind, he doesnt care for small talk, acts like he is too good for anybody, and usually doesnt care or listen to your problems.
  The main moral of the story is to be aware of what other people and even animals could be going through.  Even though you don't know them, that doesnt mean that you know what their past was like, or that you can just judge them based on the way they look.
I would recommend this story to anyone who likes a heartfelt and emotional story of a domesticated animal.  Overall this book had its ups and downs of emotional twist and turns, it equally distributed the uplifting and depressing parts throughout the chapters.  The parts of the story that I have presented to you are just snippets of an extraordinary book.

7818,711,1926,"About three-quarters of the way through THE SANDMAN, there is a wondrous passage (in a book full of them) that uses trap nets and lobster pots as a metaphor for bad decisions leading irrevocably to disastrous actions. As much as I wanted to gallop through the last hundred pages in the same manner as I had the previous 300, I had to stop and dwell for a few minutes on the perfection of it and what had gone before. It was stunning, as is the plot and prose of this unforgettable thriller.

THE SANDMAN is the fourth installment in Lars Keplers series featuring Joona Linna, the taciturn Stockholm detective inspector. Many of you (but, I dare say, perhaps not enough of you) are familiar with the first three volumes: THE HYPNOTIST, THE NIGHTMARE and THE FIRE WITNESS. This trio will be republished over the next year or so with new translations (thanks to the extraordinary efforts of Neil Smith). But please do not wait to read this latest offering. Kepler does an excellent job of bringing newcomers into the tent while refreshing fans recollections. In any event, you don't want to delay or deny yourself one of the best reading experiences of 2018.

The novel commences in the middle of a precipitous railroad bridge during a nighttime snowstorm. It is there that a young man named Mikael Kohler-Frost is found, wandering and hysterical. The discovery would be unusual enough, but is made more so by the fact that Mikael and his sister, Felicia, had been missing for 13 years and was declared dead. Mikael, who is in the throes of delirium and is all but incoherent, insists that his sister is still alive and is being held captive by someone called the Sandman. Mikaels allegations are of particular interest to Joona. It was he who, years ago after making a major personal sacrifice, caught Jurek Walter, Swedens most notorious serial killer. Jurek, who is permanently ensconced in a maximum security psychiatric hospital, was thought to have numbered Mikael and Felicia among his many victims. Linna was sure that Jurek had an accomplice in his dastardly work, but was never able to prove it.

Mikaels reappearance changes everything. Linna is more certain than ever that Jurek had help, and that if Felicia is ever to be rescued, Jurek has to be persuaded --- or tricked --- into revealing her whereabouts and that of his accomplice. Linna concocts a daring plan to insert an undercover agent into the psychiatric ward where Jurek is imprisoned and to somehow gain his trust. It is the execution of this plan and its aftermath that unfolds during most of the books second half, and the suspense is nothing less than excruciating. The agent selected is Saga Bauer, a quietly damaged inspector who is tapped for the job --- and accepts it --- at the worst possible time for her. She finds herself under siege on the ward from adversaries expected and otherwise.

The most dangerous, of course, is Jurek, who is as frightening and nightmarish a character as you are likely to encounter in a book in quite a while. On the one hand, he is almost too much to take. On the other, it is nearly impossible to stop reading THE SANDMAN at any particular point. Its not that theres no good place to set aside the novel; its that there is practically no way to do that. Kepler keeps things moving with short chapters and frequent changes in points of view. As a result, the reader isn't drawn into the story so much as given to running into it, voluntarily and with abandon. There are many ticking clocks, as Linna and his team set out to rescue Felicia, Bauer tries to save herself, and Jurek does what Jurek does best. Remember the trap nets and lobster pots I mentioned at the beginning of this review? Anyone who starts reading the book will identify with the lobster, particularly during the multiple conclusions that speed the reader toward the final paragraphs.

Ah, those final paragraphs. THE SANDMAN is complete in itself, but anyone who reads it will be sitting on tenterhooks, waiting for the next installment (which already has been published in Sweden). Get the first three books in their new editions and read them while you are waiting. It won't pass the time entirely, but it will help.

Meg doesnt think they are normal but Charles doesnt seem to be bothered. However, one day Mrs. Whatsit says she can help find Megs father. Meg and Charles seem suspicious until they tell them they have magic. Calvin, a tall 7th grade boy is a friend of Meg and is summoned by Mrs. Whatsit to take care of Meg while they go on their journey. Meg reluctantly accepts along with Calvin and Charles to go with Mrs. Whatsit to find their father, and so their quest begins. Will they survive and find father, or will they all perish to a close person. Get A Wrinkle in Time to find out.

Overall this book teaches me that even if you don't feel you're a great person, that doesnt mean you cant change it. For example, Meg goes from being like an odd, quirky girl, to a brave heroine risking her life to try to save her father. I feel this book is great and I love how creative, emotional, and lively it is. I hope the movie is, too.

If you are imaginative and love to be creative, Id recommend A Wrinkle in Time to you. Even if its not your genre of choice, this book is still a classic! The perfection this book has mystery, creativity, and all the qualities for a great book.

7825,476,1921,3.5 stars. I don't have great luck when it comes to award-winning books. The qualities the judges are using are just not a great fit with my reading style and preferences. I liked the kids in the story (although the bully was truly awful - not for what he did so much as what he BELIEVED and how that made him treat others). But nothing about the story really spoke to me. It felt flat and slow when I prefer deeper character development and relationships and more movement and faster pacing. This just wasn't a good fit for me as a reader.,1520899200,3
7826,566,1934,"Maybe 3.5

This book started out at a gallop, then slowed to a trot and finally ended with a sprint to the finish.

Clara Mayfield is desperate, after helping her sister elope and dragging her family into scandal, she has finishing the season with no prospects until the vile Baron Rutherford asks for her hand. Clara would rather be a spinster than marry the Baron, but her nouveau riche parents long to be accepted by the ton and will not listen to her protests, leaving her no choice but to run away.

With the help of her maid she finds a position in the home of the reclusive William Halstead, the Earl of Ashworth. William has sequestered himself away in the county since the death of his father, older brother and brother in law. He suffers from flashbacks and panic attacks since the accident that claimed his loved ones and has no desire to be part of society. But when he meets Clara, while saving her life, he feels alive for the first time in almost two years. He walks away from her and is shocked and disappointed when she is at his home applying for a position in his under staffed household. At first he refuses to hire her, but finally agrees to a probationary period, he asks her name and she tells him her name is Helen.

For me the story really slowed down at this point, there is not a lot of interaction with Clara/Helen and William, it is mostly Helen the housemaid trying to fit in with the ""below stairs"" employees and her relationship with his niece, Rosa. While the scenes with William are sparse and fleeting, there is an undeniable attraction between them, but they never spent enough time together for me to believe there was any real connection between them.

The story progresses slowly and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but when the author begins to wrap up the story, it gains a second wind and takes off like a rocket. And when Clara's past finally catches up with her, will William be able to forgive her deceit?

I thought this was a decent debut, the writing is a bit on the wordy side and the relationship between William and Clara could have used a bit more development, there were also some inconsistencies and one glaring title error (which is not that bad considering there were several titled characters in the book). But overall, the story was good and I think with time this author will be a strong voice in the HR genre.

Throughout the book, I was mesmerized by the plot and by the fact that day-to-day life in the Utopian ""community"" was actually horrifying.  In particular, when a decision was made about the fate of a set of twins, I thought of my own twin toddler grandsons and could not possibly imagine selecting which one would live.  I was eager to discover the book's ending, but when it came, I said, ""What?""  I was sure I must have missed something, but after rereading multiple times, I Googled it and learned I was typical in not understanding it, and that Lois Lowry had in fact said it was open to interpretation.

7831,66,1892,"I seem to be swimming against the tide again in my reaction to another new HR release. I thought to try out Linden's new series, even though her previous Scandals books did not appeal to me. But this one goes into the same file as Kleypas' and Campbell's latest novels. It's competently written but Linden and the other two are not one third the wordsmiths of a Meredith Duran, Jayne Fresina, Elizabeth Kingston, Sherry Thomas, or Courtney Milan. Linden tells stories, but the way she writes never blows me away with its cleverness, lyrical prose, or great dialogue. And the plot of this one is predictable and derivative, with uninspired characters from Central Casting.

As heroine we have poor orphaned Sophie Graham, who has to struggle to make it on her own in the world, since her parents are both deceased and her grandfather agreed only to pay her education and after that she was not to count on him for anything. Fortunately, she learned her way around cards and gaming from her father (disowned by her grandfather because of his mesalliance with a French opera singer) and knows how to count cards and other card sharp tricks. With a goal of accumulating enough funds to retire within six years, Sophie frequents Vega Club, one of the few gambling clubs open to women gamblers.

Our hero is Jack Lindeville, Duke of Ware. Jack is fully cognizant of his duties and responsibilities as a peer of the realm and is a sober, reliable, perhaps slightly stick-up-his-patootie person. But there's a thorn in his side: irresponsible younger brother Philip, who has taken to losing scads of money gambling inexpertly at that Vega Club frequented by Sophie.

When Jack goes to the club to pay off Philip's debts, who should he find there but Philip, flirting with a lovely woman gambler. Jack is peeved, to say the least. First, Philip was not supposed to gamble any more and second, it appears that that hussy is encouraging him to lose more money. To discourage this, Jack makes a bet with her: 5000 pounds of his against her spending one week with him. She accepts. And loses. And that's pretty much the story. They go off together to one of Jack's lesser estates and are appropriately trapped there by heavy rains, impassable roads, and a broken carriage axle.

Naturally they have the hots for each other. Naturally they both know nothing can really come of it. She wants respectability and marriage. He wants her in his bed but knows she's not respectable enough to be his wife. But, of course, they cannot deny their great sexual attraction and continue their clandestine affair once they have returned to London. Then comes that predictable quandary: marriage or mistress.

There's also a minor snafu with a supposed longstanding betrothal of Jack to another young woman, something that did not need to be there except, I guess, because otherwise there would not have been enough pages in the book.

What little plot there was here did not entertain me. It was too been-there, done-that. And I had so many problems with the actions of these characters.

(1) Why on earth did Sophie agree to that wager? How could she possibly think that this would stay in the club and not get out into the gossiping ton? This wasn't Vegas, where what happens there, stays there. For a woman who needed to stay respectable, she wasn't very smart.

(2) Why did Sophie start out as such a strong female and then turn into a silly puddle around Jack? I dislike women who become weak around a handsome man. He wasn't even all that pleasant to her when she first felt this attraction.

(3) Why did the author feel the need to add in the plot line with Jack's longtime implied engagement? It was needless filler that produced a Trite Misunderstanding that added nothing to the plot but annoyed the heck out of me. And more to the point: Why didn't Sophie go to Jack to get this clarified instead of talking to that idiot Philip?

(4) Why was Jack so ineffectual in his dealings with his brother? How could he be so poor at controlling his gambling? And his plan to follow Philip around Vega Club was ridiculous.

(5) Why did we have that predictable bit at the end with Sophie meeting up with the new Viscount Makepeace? That watered down the whole ""I'm going to marry you no matter who you are"" from Jack.

And, as long as I am being such an annoying gritch here, I've got a couple lesser things to complain about: (1) Why not ""vingt-et-un""? Isn't that more correct than ""vingt-un""? and (2) Why would a duke use a hackney to get home from Vega Club? Wouldn't that be too vulgar and common? Shouldn't a duke move around in his own ducal carriage?

I was totally mesmerized by the story of Florrie and her little sister Rosie, poor orphaned flower sellers in London's Covent Garden in 1912. What a dreadful life those poor girls led. I enjoyed learning about Tilly Harper, the young girl who came down from the Lake District to work in the home/orphanage for the flower girls started by the benevolent Mr. Shaw to help the flower girls live a decent, productive life. I found myself fully transported to another time and place with Ms. Gaynor's wonderfully, luscious, descriptive writing.

Problems with this book:

The character development.......wait sorry, there wasn't any.

Unpredictable.....nope totally knew from ninth chapter what was going to happen.

Throne of Glass meets Game of Thrones; with the dull characters of Twilight and a pathetic attempt at X-Men origins. To the authors credit, she created a female main character no one will like. I found myself rooting against Mave and here brooding.

I found Prince Joffrey and Robb Stark have a lot in common with Maven and Cal. Bella and Mave have a lot of personalitytraits. Both plain and brooding. At least Hunger Games, Luna Chronicles, Throne of Glass series,  Shatter Me, Carnival and City of Bones have likeable female characters.

I enjoyed the concept and build up. But, I refuse to read another book in this series. If Victoria Aveyard ran with her story instead, it'd be worth the extra read. This book left me frustrated and annoyed. Hopefully other readers will learn from my mistake.",1520899200,1

7838,777,1910,"This book will be added to my all time favorite WWII list of books. Extremely well done. The setting is the small village of Vergers on the Normandy Coast of France. The story leads up to D-Day, June 5, 1944. The story seems so simple on the surface, but it is well crafted and deceptively profound. We meet the villagers all beaten down, suffering, and barely getting by under Nazi Occupation. The protagonist, Emma becomes the town baker when the Jewish man who was her boss, is hauled away to a concentration camp. She lives with her grandmother, Meme, who seems to be getting a bit senile. Goat is the name a man who Emma attended school with who now she can't seem to stand, though she allows him to live in her pig shed. Pierre is a farmer with the last few cows left in the village. Fleur and her mother are what's left of the veterinarian's family after the Nazis killed him as the village looked on. There are so many more villagers, the Argents and their baby Gabrielle (wealthy Parisians who own a large villa on the coast) Monkey Boy (who seems like a simpleton, but might be autistic) Odette (owner of the village restaurant stuck catering to the Nazis), Margeurite (owner of the tobacco shop), Maria (who might be the village tart giving favors to the Nazis) and the Monsignor (trying to save the souls of the villagers). They are all tied together by what they all have to offer and what they all need. The story builds to D-Day and we get to see it from the other side, the village watching from high on the hill as the troops come ashore. Quote: You came for us! I never thought you would."" - Emma",1520899200,5
7839,712,585,"Africa is a continent with a long, troubled history of violence, apartheid, colonialism, and poverty... and sadly, it's a history many outside Africa are all too willing to ignore or forget.  The Western world has not been kind to Africa, to put it lightly, and the countries and territories of this beautiful but treacherous land will bear the scars of occupation and exploitation for a long time to come.  Barbara Kingsolver's novel, ""The Poisonwood Bible,"" pulls few punches in describing just how Western interference has upset the lives of the people of the Congo (now two separate countries, one briefly bearing the name of Zaire for a time), and its characters come to Africa with the hopes of ""bettering"" the lives of the people... only to be taught harsh lessons along the way.  It's a powerful, gut-wrenching read, and one I'm glad I read even if it was horrifying at times.

""The Poisonwood Bible"" follows the Price family as the travel to the Belgium-occupied Congo in the early '60s to do missionary work.  Baptist preacher Nathan Price rules his wife and four daughters with an iron fist and expects to bring salvation and enlightenment to the village where he has been assigned... but Africa has harsh lessons in store for him and his family.  As the Prices face starvation, wild animals, the mistrust of their neighbors, and the sudden independence of the Congo that will plunge the newfound country into decades of violence and political upheaval, the quiet but determined Orleanna Price and her four daughters -- vain and sophisticated Rachel, devoted but studious Leah, physically handicapped but mentally gifted Adah, and young and curious Ruth May -- find themselves being deeply changed by the very country they've set out to civilize and tame.  But whether the changes are for the better or the worse -- and whether any of them will leave Africa alive, let alone unscathed -- remains to be seen...

Barbara Kingsolver tells a fascinating tale that weaves together five distinct different voices -- no small feat for a writer.  Every female member of the Price family has sections narrated from their point of view, and it's fascinating to see all their different takes on the events of the novel.  And while some characters are definitely more likable than others (Rachel comes across as a spoiled brat, while Adah's fatalistic, cynical outlook can wear down the reader), they all have their own unique outlooks on Africa and its people, as well as the trials they undergo.  And all five women are complex characters in their own right, flawed but with their own strengths that will ultimately determine whether they make it or not in this dangerous new land.  It might have been interesting to see a few sections narrated by the father of the family, as he comes across as a relatively shallow character by comparison, but then, it might have been difficult to fit in any more character viewpoints.

The book itself is set during actual historical events, and even if most of these happen in the background, they still ultimately impact the novel in powerful ways.  This book is not only a tale of struggling to survive and adapt in an unforgiving new world, but of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of another culture, and in trying to force our ways on a country and a people not suited to them.  It's a very anti-colonialism novel, and while that is bound to upset some people, one can't deny that they'll come away from this novel with some inkling of the damages the Western world has inflicted on Africa in the name of progress, and wondering if said damages were worth the outcome.

This novel left me angry at times, and saddened me... but ultimately it told a story I needed to hear.  And not only does it carry a strong message that needed to be told, it gave a compelling story about how one family undergoes dramatic and heartwrenching changes in a land on the cusp of a political and cultural revolution.  Highly recommended.",1520899200,5

7842,1153,292,"This book is my favorite from Rick Riordan. It is gripping from the start. The setting stays in the outskirts of New York. The Greek god, Apollo, loses his powers and falls to earth as a puny, 16 year old human.  He immediately comes into trouble because two thugs corner him in an alley. However, a girl named Meg saves him from the thieves trying to take his money.

From that moment, Apollo knew she was special and probably the  daughter of a god. So Apollo takes Meg and brings her to Camp Halfblood, with the help of Percy Jackson. The Jacksons kindly take them, they fall into many  troubles and fights, like with Karpos, and maybe even Megs father! This book flows well into the next one and the Percy Jackson series. I cant wait for you to read this book because, Ive been on the edge of my seat all of winter.

7843,773,991,"While at first glance Hollys inclusion as the first female member of her order showed promise for a favorable interpretation of women, the novel sort of undid this work the deeper it went. Hollys superior was tough on her because she was a woman, but she accepted that his unfair treatment of her was just because he wanted her to be great - but this arrangement still resulted in belittling and unfair treatment, instead of the two of them working as allies to overcome a sexist situation.

Then, Juliet Butler was described as attractive... a cook... obsessed with boys and her nails... and unexpectedly good at combat if not for her heritage. No reason was given for her being this way other than her being a girl - and she is depicted also as a character who is incompetent and in need of protecting. In this way she resembled a caricature of a female stereotype more so than an actual developed character with a personality.

By contrast, the most prominent male characters are conniving, aggressive, powerful, and all in some way in charge of the women. It was a really dissatisfying portrayal of women, and to a reader without a critical eye, I think this would reinforce an unfair and unequal concept of women.

Then, the holes.... how could a rough computer translation of an unfamiliar language come out with rhymes? If humans are so much worse at getting along with each other than fairies, why are fairies so often aggressive, rude, and at war?

Despite these critiques, I found the depiction of fairies unique and fun to explore, and the plot kept me reading. I enjoyed discovering this classic read for the first time, but I cant say I would strongly recommend it or reread it.",1520899200,2

7848,159,1505,"I'm on a real mystery/thriller kick right now and, I am delighted to say, there are a surprising number of highly anticipated books like this coming out this year. It's only March and this is my fourth such book so far...and I've got a toppling stack more to read. And so far they've all had that delicious ""unreliable narrator' that is so popular right now and I, for one, cannot get enough! Sometimes I Lie is a great example of this suspenseful and page-turning sort of novel, while also turning the genre on its head and making it wholly original and all its own.

 The story is told in three alternating timelines: ""Now"": Amber in a coma in the hospital but not remembering what brought her there; ""Then"": Amber talking about issues at her job and in her personal life, starting about a week before her coma and leading up to what happened; and ""Then"": diary entries from the 1990s that bring interesting insight into the terror and confusion unfolding in the present time. Through much of the beginning of the story the author keeps everything somewhat vague, with Amber talking about being an outsider at work, not having a lot of friends, and being somewhat invisible to everyone, including her family. Being that the synopsis plainly states that Amber lies I tried to take everything I read with a grain of salt while trying to figure out exactly where this story was headed. Being someone who is usually pretty good at figuring twists out I am so happy to state that I was completely thrown by the many (and I mean many!) twists this story took as the myriad of tangled truths and lies finally started to fall into place. At every turn I thought I was on to something and then was completely thrown off course by the truth. And the final pages...I had read in other reviews that they hold a shocking twist and that statement is completely true. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all!

 I can't really say too much more about the plot without giving something away, but I will say that the vast majority of the main characters introduced are hiding things from the reader and that all the various connections, half-truths and straight lies do come out into the light by the last page, which I appreciate as I hate when the dots aren't connected by the end. I will also say that my favorite parts of the story took place within Amber's mind while she was in a coma as these parts were so very creepy for a few different reasons. I have a tendency to get claustrophobic, so reading things about small spaces or someone being trapped tend to make me feel anxious, which makes even more of an impression for this sort of story. The sections of the story where Amber was able to hear and feel things happening around and to her made me so tense, especially when she's let us know some of her secrets but she can't communicate with the other characters to let them know. Add on to this some horrific nightmares she has that involve a little girl with no face who creepy-sings nursery rhymes to her and I was both completely horrified and completely hooked.

Sometimes I Lie is a wonderful example of the current trend in psychological thrillers where you can't trust anyone or even your own interpretation of what you're reading. Every twist has a turn and every character has a lie on their lips. If you, like me, are eating up this sort of story than you want to pick up Sometimes I Lie!",1520899200,5
7849,596,1505,"I really enjoyed this book.  I am actually a little surprised by how much I ended up liking it.  I decided to read this book because I was intrigued by the description.  It was that same description that had me worried that this book may not work for me.  I love the idea of unreliable narrators but I have had mixed luck with them.  Let me just say that this book worked very well for me on all levels.  I read almost the whole book in a single day and could seem to stop turning pages.  I am so glad that I decided to give this book a try.

This is Amber's story.  Amber is in a coma and can hear what is going on around her but can't respond.  I was immediately drawn into the story because I felt like I needed to know how Amber ended up in that coma.  I wouldn't really say that I liked Amber or any of the other characters in the story but I didn't dislike them either.  I had no idea who to trust at any point in the story.

The dual timelines in this book worked well.  Piece by piece, we learn the details of what events led up to her hospitalization as well as everything happening around her while she is in the coma.  I was really equally interesting in both timelines and thought that the story switched from then to now at just the right moments to keep the story moving forward.

This book was full of twists and turns.  It is really best to go into this book as blindly as possible which I was thankfully able to do.  As I read the book I quickly discovered that everything that I thought I knew about the story was completely wrong.  I was taken by surprise many times over the course of the story and sometimes had to take a short break just to process what I had just learned.  I quickly began to expect the unexpected and I still found that I was shocked by some of the twists along the way.

I would recommend this book to others.  I loved how this book kept me guessing until the very end.  I am really impressed with Alice Feeney's style of writing and hope to read more of her work in the future.

We see her life in the past and the present and the way the plot fits together, like a set of Russian dolls, is impressive. There are small clues throughout the novel that plant little seeds for what comes next. Once I read the whole story, it re-wrote itself in my head. The author played with my expectations and subverted everything. Since Amber is in a coma, she must be a clueless victim, right? Well, not to give anything away, but she may be hiding some secrets. Her husband Paul seems way too perfect, he must be a psycho, right? Again, I don't think I even imagined what was going to happen. All the characters break the usual mold of the psychological novels and surprise even the more jaded reader. This is an excellent, tight, well-built and perfectly paced novel.

7853,642,1505,"My Review of ""Sometimes I Lie"" by Alice Feeney

WOW! Kudos to Alice Feeney , Author of ""Sometimes I Lie"", for the riveting, captivating, intense Psychological Thriller. The timeline of the story deals with mostly the present and the past, and leaves one wondering about the future. Alice Feeney describes her characters as complex and complicated. Some are pathological, and even the narration is told in possibly  unreliable voices.

Amber Reynolds is in a coma in a hospital and tells you three things from the get-go.

""1. I'm in a coma"". 2. My husband doesn't love me anymore. 3. Sometimes I lie.""

The author goes to the past, and brings in diaries of  younger lives, and as we are in the present, we are with Amber as she hears the voices around her, not being able to do anything. How did she get here? Who's was she with? Why did this happen?

As the story progresses, so does the intensity. All of the characters seem to have secrets, and seem to be suspect. There are many twists and turns, and what you think, is questionable. From the beginning to the end, there is tremendous anxiety and tension.

Of course, at the end, I will just say, I said ""OMG!!!!!""  I would highly recommend this book for readers who enjoy a face paced exciting, thrilling, psychological mystery that is hauntingly very  engrossing. I received this Advanced Reading ARC for my honest review.

7855,75,1312,"We are not often blessed with persons of the amazing intelligence of Richard Feynman.  Even someone with just a smattering of science and math can appreciate this Nobel Prize winning,  bongo drum playing,  safe cracking denizen of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.  Here was a man of superior intellect who could yet relate to the world around him and who had a curious interest in many facets of human endeavor.  That is coupled with obvious tenderness toward his first wife,  who dies of TB during the Manhattan Project.  Even as Feynman writes about that in tightlipped fashion,  his deep love for her and sorrow for the loss  comes through.

The book is not tightly organized  but it is smartly written.  Guys like Einstein,  Feynman,  Carl Sagan will all wrestle from time to time with the non-scientific question of what preceded the Big Bang,  if only by asking fleetingly if there is some principle of causation behind it all.  Obviously I don't know if God exists or what it all means.  But it is hard for me to think that such a towering intellect encased in such a lovely witty and wise person results from mere accident.

7858,275,1505,"Weaving back and forth between the present, the recent past and diary entries from 1991, Sometimes I Lie by Alice Feeney is a twist-turny, suspenseful novel that is absolutely riveting.

Amber Reynolds is in a coma yet she is aware of what is occurring around her. What she is unclear about is the sequence of events that led up to the coma. As memories begin to come back to her, she is afraid of her husband, Paul, uneasy about her sister Claires presence and terrified of the stranger who keeps showing up in her hospital room. Unable to make sense of these confusing facts, Amber continues to try to remember what happened to her and who is responsible for the accident that left her in a coma.

In the present, Amber tries to piece together the wispy memories and her discordant emotions in an attempt to figure out how she ended up in a coma.  A variety of events taking place around her don't jibe with the facts she remembers so she is extremely puzzled about various happenings.  Her marriage to Paul is a bit strained so is that the reason she is afraid he had something to do with the accident? Claire and Paul do not like one another, so why are they spending so much time together in her hospital room? And even more troubling, why are they actually getting along? But most important, who is the stranger who keeps showing up in her room? Why is Amber so frightened by what he is saying and doing while he is with her?

In the week leading up to the accident, Amber is on the cusp of losing her job at a local radio station. Her relationship with co-worker and popular radio host Madeline Frost is fraught with tension. Luckily for Amber, her good friend Jo helps her devise a plan to tarnish Madelines reputation in order to prevent the disagreeable radio personality from making the threat of job loss a reality.

Already stressed over her job situation, Amber also notices a few inconsistencies with Paul that her make her very suspicious that he might not love her anymore. She is also rather troubled by a few discoveries that make her question whether or not Claire is up to something nefarious but Amber is uncertain whether or not her sister would do something to deliberately hurt her.

The diary entries are written from an eleven year old girls point of view. The young girls family moved around quite a bit but they recently located to help her grandmother who recently passed away. Her home life is quite unhappy due to her parents constant arguing and their excessive drinking. A bright spot in her situation is her recent friendship with a classmate but there are disturbing elements to their friendship that will definitely give readers pause.

Sometimes I Lie is an absolutely spellbinding and suspense-laden mystery that raises many intriguing questions. Is Amber a reliable narrator? As she lies in a coma, can she trust her memories? Can she trust Paul? Have Paul and Claire resolved their longstanding differences and if so, why? Who is the stranger who keeps visiting her and is she right to fear for her safety? As Alice Feeney brings this novel to a jaw-dropping and stunning conclusion, readers will be left wondering whether or not they can trust anyone in this twist-filled page-turner.

7859,1153,179,"Have you ever wondered how people survive in the big woods without a store right around the corner and having wildlife surround you?

The main characters of this story are a little girl named Laura, her sisters Mary and Carrie, and her mother and father. Laura is very happy and always has a positive attitude. Laura's family are pioneers, who live in a can in the big woods. Her family was part of the growing population of pioneers who at the time were beginning to explore and move to the west. Laura and Mary are very responsible because they help Ma with the daily chores. For example, they have to help make the beds or help set the table for dinner.

Their life can be very hard at times because they have to hunt and plant food. Pa goes out hunting at night, while Ma, Laura, and Mary clean up dinner and take a bath.  When Pa gets back from hunting, he plays his fiddle for Laura and Mary, or tells them a story, then they head off to bed. In the spring time, they make maple syrup and have dances at grandma and grandpa's house. They enjoy their life by spending time with their family and friends and by doing fun activities. Although, they enjoy their life they also wish they had a better life. They have to hunt for their own food and protect themselves from the wildlife. The message of the story is to not complain what you have, because others have worse. Don't complain because someone else has better.

My recommendation on this book is positive. I think it was in was interesting to read about how this family survives in the big woods, and still has fun with many fun activities. If you want to read more about how their lives, then read this book!

7864,749,1505,"This was an incredibly well-done novel that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Even though the unreliable narrator is made clear from the very start, I still had a very difficult time piecing together what was true and what wasnt. Ambers character is extremely compelling and its difficult not to trust her.

The novel is split up by time periods: the coma, the week before the coma, and childhood. The chapters are carefully crafted so that just enough anticipation builds up before the time period changes and the reader is left wondering what happened. This method really works with the story, allowing us to piece together just enough for the plot to move forward while still wanting more.

There were so many twists that I felt were truly surprising, I had a couple of literal jaw-dropping moments while reading. The end felt a tad rushed and I didn't quite agree with how everything went down, but overall it was a highly enjoyable read.

7869,530,234,"""When we think of the past its the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that.""

This is one of my favorite quotes from this book, and yet it's far from true.

The book is a recounting of a lone woman's tale in a dark, future part of the world. It's a merging of evils - environmental destruction, widespread infertility, discrimination by religious beliefs, all blamed on the wiles and evils of loose, liberated women and the men who allowed them to become that way.

Given the basics of world history, much of the tale rings eerily true, pulling different awful moments together to create this narrative. Slavery, the Holocaust, public executions, and the days before most civil rights combine to create a possible future that has been a must read for decades.

The narrator tells her story in turn, moving from her present to her past, seemingly amazed that they both coexist. She speaks to an unknown audience, apologizing for parts of the tale, and admitting when her imagination gets away from her, wishing for things that cannot be or cannot return.

While not the first time I've read this tale, I pull different things from it each time. Rather than earlier readings, feeling the raw emotion that it can inspire, I analyzed more this time, mentally tracking sources of inspiration and how the novel was woven together so neatly, complete with a sociologist's analysis at the end.

Could this world happen?  It already does - and did - on certain levels, in certain places in the world.  That's part of what makes it both ring true, and so compelling.",1520985600,5
7870,184,232,"Philip K. Dick is a prolific science fiction writer. The Man in the High Castle is his account of what life might be like if the Germans and Japanese had won WW II.  The plot centers around three groups and issues. The first involves Robert Childan who is the owner of a shop that sells memorabilia and his efforts at financial success. The second is political and includes Japanese and German officials and intrigue with people not being who them seem to be. The third focuses on a book The Grasshopper Lies Heavy that describes the world that would have been if the allies had won WWII.  The title refers to the author of this book, Hawthorne Abendson, who purported lives in such a place to protect himself from being killed by the Germans.

Dick portrays the Japanese as being somewhat more humane that the Germans who continue to kill Jews and now have a plan to drop nuclear weapons on Japan. The novel comes to an abrupt and inconclusive end.  I really found it quite strange with various characters consulting oracles and acting in other odd ways. However it might be interesting to people who wonder what the world would have been like if the Germans and Japanese had won.",1520985600,2
7871,730,503,"Well, here we are. 1500 pages and several months later, and all I have to say is poor Roger.

I do agree with the qualms that not much happens in this book because nothing major really happened. Aside from some major plot-advancing events in the last 500 pages, the majority of this book was filler. But, that is not to say that I didn't enjoy it. As opposed to the previous four books that I finished within a week or two, I took my time with this book and balanced reading it with other books.

As always, I treasured the moments between Claire and Jamie. They are the reason I fell in love with this series in the first place and will ALWAYS be my favorite couple. Moving up in the couples rank are surprisingly Roger and Brianna. I've always disliked Brianna and I still harbored anger and annoyance towards her for most of this book. However, upon reflection, I realized that my hatred of Brianna has lessened slightly. I still find her slightly selfish and annoying but I've come to accept her because she has developed some and Roger loves her. ROGER! He was put through trials and tribulations in this book but it warmed my heart to see him step up for Brianna and his family.

I even enjoyed Roger and Brianna's growing relationship(as annoying as she was in the last two books). Then, during the second part of the book, her actions completely infuriated me. Almost all of the events could have been avoided through communication, and if she just got over her stubborn selfishness. At this point, I think I will take a break from the series to settle my feeling, then determine if I will continue.",1520985600,3
7873,25,1936,"A difficult book to review.  Regrettably, I found it very tedious to read.  In fact, I resorted to skimming a number of sections, something I almost never do.  First, the positives:  author Bart Ehrman is clearly a biblical and early Christian expert. (I am certainly not.)  He fully discloses his beliefs (he has moved from an evangelical christian to a non-believer over his lifetime).  His writing is commendably neutral - he is good at keeping his opinion out of the factual story.  And I learned a LOT about the 300 to 400 years following Jesus's lifetime.  The development of Christianity is covered in detail.  Now the negatives.  For me, it boils down to drowning in repetitive detail.  After a while, the facts and repetition became overwhelming.  This book will interest some and probably anger a few.  I learned a lot, but cannot recommend it due to my difficulty in getting through it.",1520985600,3

7879,31,1895,"Confession time: I pretty much picked A Princess in Theory up initially because of the absolutely gorgeous color. There's no sense in denying that's what initially drew me to it. I've also been interested in adding some diversity to the romance I'm reading, so that made me want to read it even more. Once I actually read the blurb, I knew I absolutely had to read it. I'm so glad I did, too.

Who doesn't love a good royal romance? I know I do. There's something about the ""regular girl"" and prince/king/whatever pairing that just works for me. The added twist here of Naledi and Thabiso actually being betrothed while they were kids made it even better. It had a definite second chance(ish) feel to it and that's basically catnip to me. From the beginning when Thabiso was lying about his identity and pretending to be a commoner through the time spent together getting to know each other  and themselves, in some respect  again, I loved it all.

The characters were fantastic, too. Ledi was a totally kickass heroine. I'd be friends with her in real life in a heartbeat. I was girl crushing on her pretty hard after only a couple chapters. I appreciated her humor, drive and intelligence. She was so easy to relate to. Thabiso was so freaking swoony I almost didn't know what to do with myself. I'm a total sucker for a hero who is all in and only has eyes for one woman. He totally wore his heart on his sleeve and I loved it.

A Princess in Theory was a hit. It was fun and sexy and even delivered some feels. I can't wait to see what's next for the Reluctant Royals series. I've had heart eyes for the cover of A Duke by Default since I first saw it, but now that I know the words inside are just as fantastic as the cover, I have total grabby hands.",1520985600,4

7882,16,27,"If I Die Tonight is Alison Gaylin's newest release. This was a first read of this author for me, but it won't be the last.

Small town USA. An aging pop star who goes by the name Amie Em stumbles in the local police station, saying she was carjacked by a teenaged boy. Another boy named Liam tried to stop the theft and was critically injured. But her story keeps changing and there are gaping holes in her recounting of the crime. The finger is inevitably pointed at Wade - a high school outcast.

Gaylin mirrors today's society- much of the case is debated online in various social forums. The presumption of innocent until proven guilty doesn't figure into the diatribe.. A young man's life is irrevocably changed and the injured teen becomes a downed hero to the town.

But is Wade guilty? He refuses to speak about that night. His mother Jackie knows he is not capable of such an act. Or is he? Gaylin tells this story through many points of view, giving the reader options as to what the outcome might be. I felt for Jackie as she struggled to clear her son's name. Gaylin's depictions of her emotions and relationships with her sons was well done. But my favourite supporting character was Officer Pearl Maze. She has her own issues, but was the clearest thinking character for me. (And I'd really like to see her in another book.)

Gaylin provides red herrings and alternative outcomes along the way to the final whodunit. I admit to having my suspicions about one character, who was just a little too calm and helpful for me. And yes, they did figure into the final reveal. But, that in no way detracted from my enjoyment of If I Die Tonight.  A n entertaining read and I will be picking up Gaylin's next book.",1520985600,4
7883,464,1897,"I had every intention of reading the first three before this: but that (along with every other plan I made this month) went left and disappeared down the rabbit hole.  But, I didn't have to worry since I was able to follow the story without issues, and delight in the connections made within the book.  Garret is a wonderfully independent, rebellious and intelligent woman with zero care for convention or societal pressures.  Shes a physician with her own successful clinic and little time or patience for fancy society parties or the marriage-mart atmosphere. Shes not interested in marriage or other more traditional paths for women, but shed never thought that it was because she hadnt met the right man.

Ethan Ransom is a man without limits, with a nodding acquaintance with rules, even as he chooses to ignore most of them.  Headstrong, intelligent, capable and accomplished, his tenure with Scotland Yard is over, and hes finding intrigue and interest in a beautiful physician, one that spurns the rigamarole of society as vehemently as he does himself.  Now when the intrigue and danger for him have grown tenfold, hes finding that keeping all these secrets and staying aloof, particularly when Garett is involved and potentially in danger, doesnt seem quite so interesting or fulfilling.

This was a wonderful story of growth and self-realization as both Garrett and Ransom come to discover their attraction is far more than superficial, and that unexpected (and perhaps even once thought unwanted) connections are possibly the best things ever. Both of them are very similar in their disdain for the overblown affectations of society, preferring self-determination and effort to make their ways in the world. While Garrett tilted to the slightly too modern end of the scale for a woman of her time, she was consistent in her beliefs and actions, and her willingness to accept the changes that would include Ransom felt natural and possible.  For his part, Ransom is a wonderfully drawn character: protective, honest, intelligent and not afraid to accept or ask for advice from Garrett, and his moments where he shares his heart are lovely. He fits with Garrett, and she with him, in ways that make them both better people, while giving readers moments to swoon and enjoy.

7884,462,819,"Clearly, AJ Finn was inspired by Paula Hawkins', The Girl On The Train. Even the books' names are similar...The Girl on the Train and The Woman in the Window. Having personally enjoyed The Girl On The Train, I was very curious and excited to read this book, particularly when I saw the massive number of reviews, paired with the very high rating, on both Goodreads and Amazon.

My VERY first thought upon reading the first few pages was that Anna Fox, the narrator, reminded me very much of Sigourney Weaver's agoraphobic, hot-mess of a character, Dr. Helen Hudson, in the film Copycat--both alcoholics, both pill poppers, both agoraphobic, both prone to panic attacks, and both doctors. Crazy, right? Having said that, as the story progressed, I found myself feeling nothing but frustration for Anna. All these crazy things are occurring around her, but she's too gorked out of her head to make any type of difference in her circumstances. I just wanted to scream, ""Put down the wine bottles, quit popping the pills, and please stop freaking lying to every single person you come into contact with, you waste of skin!"" Obviously, Anna got on my nerves.

It wasn't all bad though. I enjoyed Anna's observations about her neighbors. I enjoyed her on-line life and the conversations she had there. I enjoyed the author's ability to bring Anna's confusion and disorientation into a very real light. And I totally enjoyed the super short chapters. It kept the book moving and didn't allow Anna's constant, confused ramblings to become tedious.

But then! Then something even worse than an annoying lead character happened. As I was reading page 236, the entire storyline became crystal clear to me. I knew what the ""twist"" was, I figured out the conclusion, and that, my friends, made me want to cry. I still had 200 pages left to read and I like surprises.

There is another ""big reveal"" about 2/3 of the way through the book. I suppose you could call it a plot twist, but it's quite obvious from the very first chapter of the book.

The Woman In The Window is a fun read, but there is nothing new or original here.",1520985600,3

I didn't like Jules. She didn't make sense because I actually don't know what kind of person she is. There is no real characterization, I couldn't tell you what she likes or doesn't. She was annoying, though. Moreover, she is a special snowflake, a trope which I find unacceptable.

The pacing of this book was so slow and nothing really happened, nothing exciting that swept me off my feet.

There is a cool plot twist but to be honest, it didn't impress me very much.

Also, quite a bit of info dumping.

What I did like was the whole time-being-a-currency thing and how throughout the whole book there was this undercurrent mystery feeling to it which bound me to the book. Minimal romance in this book, yay!

7886,302,1937,"The Flicker of Old Dreams by Susan Henderson is a very highly recommended lyrical novel about small town outsiders, prejudices, and expectations.

Petroleum, Montana, population 182, is a very small, dying town. It has been in decline for twenty years, ever since the accident that took the life of a local high schooler and shut down the grain elevator, the towns main source of employment. The younger brother of the victim was blamed for his death and sent to live with relatives.

Mary Crampton has lived in Petroleum for thirty years, her whole life, and during those years she has always been a social outcast. Perhaps it is because her father owns the mortuary, or because she grew up without a mother, but Mary has never belonged. Now that she is the embalmer for her father, she is even more set apart from the townspeople around her. She had dreamed of becoming an artist, but now she finds satisfaction in her job, trying to capture the essence of a subjects life.

When Robert Golden, the brother who has been blamed for the town's demise for years, returns to care for his dying mother, old resentments and condemnations return and are all directed at him. In Robert, Mary finds an unexpected soulmate who is also an outsider. Neither Robert nor Mary conform to the expectations of the towns citizens, but Mary's burgeoning friendship and relationship with him shock and dismay the town, while Robert's presence evokes anger and acting out.

The Flicker of Old Dreams is an exquisite, beautifully written, memorable novel. In fact, it is hard to comment on such a well-written novel that seems to capture the very heart and soul of two lonely people who have been considered pariahs by the town, yet are still expected to conform to the will and expectations set by the same people. These are finely detailed, well-developed, and wonderfully crafted characters. The town itself becomes a character, as the inhabitants seem to act as one.

Henderson has created an unforgettable character in Mary - heartbreaking and so tender, caring and loyal to her father and their dying town, even as it sucks the life right out of her.  Anyone who has ever lived as an outsider in a small narrow minded town or in a family of the same ilk will understand Mary's untenable position, where she can never be a part of the town and, really, must find the way to escape in order to truly live her life. Her father, and the town, expect so much from her, mostly to live up to their expectations, and yet give so little in return. The ending is perfect, presenting redemption and hope.

Lies and deception are commonplace for both, leaving the reader without a reliable narrator to anchor the story.  As a private investigator with enough information about his target to make any person wary, Adam nevertheless becomes involved way more than his real-life counterpart would.

7890,694,1923,"ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS by Elizabeth J. Church is a compelling story of a young woman, Lily Decker, who is emotionally damaged after a tragic car accident kills her parents and sister when she is only 8 years old and who is subsequently psychologically and sexually abused by the aunt and uncle that take her in after the accident.  As soon as she graduates from high school, Lily flees to Las Vegas, changes her name to Ruby Wilde and eventually becomes a well-known and highly sought-after showgirl.  Sadly, she learns the hard way that all the glitz, glamour and material wealth she acquires do not erase the scars of her traumatic past.  The portrayal of the Las Vegas scene in the 1960s and 1970s was very interesting, but there are very graphic descriptions of the sexual abuse Lily suffers at the hands of her uncle and a later boyfriend that I found very difficult to read. Despite showing the outright exploitation and manipulation of women during these times, the reader also sees the power of friendship, determination and resiliency in the books female characters.  This book is very sad and disturbing at times, but it also allows the reader to follow Lilys journey toward healing the wounds of her past and eventually finding love and acceptance in her life.",1521072000,4

Living through her subtle transformation feels powerful and satisfying.  I appreciated how the author made the land and landscape a virtual character, and captured the fierce loyalty that borders on paralysis of locals who stay in a withering town, no matter the consequences. Now, the embalming details. I know NOTHING about how this works, and found it fascinating to learn about the process. The book's descriptions will stick with me forever, as will my hopes for Mary (and her father and Robert, a local outcast and Mary'spossible love-interest,) hoping they will all find fulfillment.

7899,825,1505,"Amber wakes up in the hospital in a coma after an accident, which she cannot remember. She is paralyzed, unable to move or speak. She feels convinced that her husband, Paul, may have had something to do with it. Her visitors include Paul and her sister, Claire.

Well, this is an interesting one. The novel takes the unreliable narrator trope to the highest level. After all, Amber is in a coma, with memory issues. She also tells us, at the beginning of the novel, that she lies. Armed with this information, we are thrown headfirst into the story, trying to figure out exactly what has happened. The reader struggles along with Amber to learn what happened as she overhears snippets in her hotel room. It's quite the ride.

The novel is told in three parts: Amber's thoughts as she struggles to remember from within the coma, Amber telling events as they lead up to the accident, and snippets of childhood journal entries. The result is a confusing, suspenseful read that makes you instantly suspicious about everything and everyone. The novel is full of warning signs and creepy moments. It also features its share of impressive twists and turns. I was definitely shocked a couple of times.

I was, honestly, a little confused sometimes too. I have some weird feelings on this one. It's a great thriller. It keeps you guessing, and it surprises you. A lot, if you're me. I'm not sure I always enjoyed it, but I'm certainly impressed by it, if that makes any sense. No more details, as I highly recommend going in spoiler-free.

7904,464,1895,"Fun, funny and surprisingly layered with depth the story focuses on Naledi (Ledi) a grad student in epidemiology, and her single-minded determination to succeed in school, support herself and lock down her summer internship all by herself.  For alone is how she thinks it needs to be: promises from others lead to expectations, and a childhood spent in state care and too many foster homes to count have given her plenty of history on which to base that decision.  Strangely enough, the one person she considers her best friend is her polar opposite: rich, unfocused, rather careless with her words and life, and while shes always sorry after the fact, her behavior often makes her a friend that Ledi finds exhausting.

Thabaso, with his personal assistant Likotsi are in New York for a series of events, and his determination to meet Ledi and convince her of her history and her connection to him. Hes headstrong, occasionally tone deaf to the wishes of those around him, the only child of the King and Queen and a real determination to do the best or his country, all while being touted in the tabloids and feeling as if no one wants to know him, once they know hes the prince.  He devises a way (with plenty of cash and an unenthusiastic Likotsi) to infiltrate Ledis life and the two begin a tentative friendship.

From a gala to the lab, a chance to investigate and solve a mysterious illness that could claim the lives of her grandparents, a more than bitchy Queen whose husband finds Ledis responses and spunkiness amusing and a villain causing the illness that is not difficult to discover, Ledi finds herself with family, history and a new friend who finds Thabasos princely moments just as annoying in his assistant Likotsi. Clever and quick reading, the story holds plenty of emotion, heart and heat to please many with the romance and Thabasos determination to see Ledi cared for and happy no matter what.

7908,52,1686,"On December 6, 1917, two ships, the Belgian supply ship Mont-Blanc and the Norwegian ship Imo collided in the harbor in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The resulting explosion was the most powerful manmade explosion on a human population excepting Nagasaki and Hiroshima, a force of 2.9 kilotons of TNT. Over 3,000 people lost their lives, and many more were wounded. Huge swathes of the city were flattened, reduced to rubble and burying survivors beneath the destruction.
Mr. Bacon's wonderful book was recommended to me by my two sisters and my brother-in-law (his grandfather Ernest Barss is one of the people mentioned in the book). It is an amazing story of resilience and courage as well as the willingness of many to help the survivors. Boston, Massachusetts sent trains and boats filled with supplies and personnel to help; as a result, Halifax has every year since sent a Christmas tree to be erected in that city.
A blizzard came in the day after the explosion and just made it even harder for the survivors and those trying to help them. It was a truly astounding event and I'm surprised how little I knew about it. The book mentions how cruise boats today will visit the cemetery where Titanic victims are buried, but nothing is told to them about the Halifax Explosion. That was certainly my experience several years ago when I visited that lovely city. But I guess this book gives me a reason to go back and visit with new eyes.
The author has a very comfortable writing style with a good eye for the small details that enhance the story. His narrative doesn't take away from the horror of the event but also addresses the acts of courage that took place.  This is probably best exemplified by this quote from the book:
""Tragedy comes quick and loud, while the small acts of decency that follow come slowly and quietly.""",1521072000,5

Paris doesnt just cross boundaries, she creates them. Watch her drawing those lines in the sand, the lines others are going to struggle to replicate or mirror, as she runs rings around her readers with this intricate plot. Its a think outside of the box kind of read.
As a reader you think you have the plot sussed and then the author just whacks you up the side of the head with a completely different solution and scenario.
In this case the #ForgetSleep tag couldn't be more accurate because your Sherlockian skills and grey cells will be asked to work overtime on Bring Me Back. Is Finn a killer? Did he forget the crime? Is she dead? Or is someone screwing with his already slightly unstable mind?
Finn has spent a lot of time recovering from the dark cloud of suspicion he has hanging over his head. The majority of people think he killed Layla, and it doesnt help that the new love of his life is the sister of his missing girlfriend. Its weird right?
Over a decade later the traumatic disappearance is brought back to the surface when a very specific item turns up, something that was really important to Layla and only a handful of people know about. It makes Finn doubt everything, even his relationship with Ellen. Its as if an invisible person is slowly chipping away at the fake exterior and trying to expose the real Finn. The Finn with anger issues, the Finn who is controlling, and the Finn who lied to the police. Yeh, that Finn.
What happened to Layla is the question of the hour, and what kind of secrets Finn keeps hidden in the dark recesses of his mind. Paris plays with the tension like a predator with its prey. Meanwhile the prey is confused as to what its role is, hence the switch from potential killer to violent abuser to whimpering victim. Its a bold, riveting read with a surprising conclusion.

7913,873,53,"First I would like to start off by saying that the narration was fantastic. I think that Scarlett Johansson did a great job bringing this story to life. The story itself is very confusing at times and I find it hard to believe that children could possibly understand a lot of it. It is fun and whimsical which might be what children enjoy, but I think that for much of it they will be lost.
I also never realized how horrible all of the animals and people in Wonderland were to Alice. Even the Mad Hatter seemed rude and impolite. I think that my outlook on the entire story has changed and in some ways I wish that it hadn't. Wonderland is a place of contradictions, I mean the name even suggests that it is a wonderful place, but in all honesty it was a messy place filled with creatures who were quite horrible and unlikable.
Overall, it was not a bad story, just not one that I would probably read to children. There is also quite a lot of violence hinted at.",1521158400,4
7914,361,1697,"In Sempera time is precious. Time, when extracted from someone's blood, can be bound to iron, which is being turned into a currency that can be consumed to increase someone's number of years. However, for a lot of people this means they constantly have to bleed to pay their debts and therefore shorten their lives, while very few members of the country's nobility thrive and live for centuries. Jules and her father used to work at Everless, an estate owned by a noble family. For Jules Everless was home, until they had to leave because of an incident that made them outcasts in just a few moments. Now they're poor and Jules has to find a way to bring in some coins.

Jules's father has given a lot of his time away and is dying. Jules wants to save him, but the only way she can earn enough coins to make up for everything he's already lost, is finding work as a servant at Everless. She's several years older than the child that was sent away and hopes the problems of the past will be forgotten. Will she be recognized? When Jules is in Everless she discovers that her departure was surrounded by secrets. While her father warned her to stay away from Everless and the country's nobility, Jules is too curious to follow his advice. She knows she's in danger, but has no idea about the extent of it. What will happen when she discovers the truth? Will she still feel the same about the people who were once an important part of her past and does she have the strength to change her own future?

Everless is a fascinating and gripping story. Jules lives in a world where time is money, literally. Those who are poor won't live very long. I admired this creative idea and Sarah Holland's execution is flawless. Jules is a strong heroine, she loves with all her heart and she's incredibly generous. She will go far to save the people she cares about and I loved her fierce personality. She isn't afraid to put herself in danger if it means she'll get the answers she needs, which makes thrilling reading. I really liked Jules and was captivated by her difficult situation from the start. I read Everless in one sitting, because I couldn't wait to find out more about all the secrets in this amazing book.

Sara Holland has written a fantastic original story. I love her world building skills and was impressed by her beautiful descriptive writing that makes the story come to life in a terrific raw way. Jules lives in a twisted and cruel world and Sara Holland perfectly describes every aspect of her perilous and heartbreaking existence. She also knows how to divide tension, which makes Everless a fabulous story to read. It's a beautiful spellbinding book that kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.",1521158400,5
7915,594,1901,"For a decade in California, from 1976 to 1986, an unknown serial rapist terrorized more than fifty people. Initially, his victims were women. Later, his crimes would include couples. Eventually, sexual assault escalated to murder.

Dubbed the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker (EAR/ONS), the predator somehow managed to evade police, despite dozens of investigations spanning numerous jurisdictions. His elusive nature, combined with the senseless acts of violence that he committed against so many, prompted true crime writer and journalist Michelle McNamara to study the case years later.

The search for the EAR/ONSwhom McNamara named the Golden State Killerconsumed McNamara, who spent countless hours researching possible suspects, theories, and clues. She connected with the case on a visceral level. Fascinated with true crime since she was a teenager, when a neighborhood girl was murdered by an unknown assailant, McNamara dedicated much of her life to researching cold cases. She documented her work on her website, True Crime Diary.

Sadly, McNamara passed away while in the process of writing this book, which was later completed by her co-researchers as well as her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt. To this day, the Golden State Killer has never been captured.

It feels terribly wrong that McNamara didn't get the chance to complete the work that she was so dedicated tofinally seeing the Golden State Killer brought to justice. But her work lives on, and the compassion she felt for the many victims is a worthy legacy indeed.

I liked the characters of Vic, Wayne and Lou, they were the heart of the story while Charlie Manx added the horror. It was a very, very slow build but the last section was full of suspense and action. I liked how the author built a crazy tower of a tale and then in the last chapters gave a great pay off. There is a lot of violence and just a heads up for the squeamish, children are not given a pass, If you like your tales dark and suspenseful this one is for you.

7920,542,468,"I'm rounding up about half a star.

Andy Weir's latest novel has key elements in common with his debut bestseller The Martian: a highly resourceful  and entertaining character, facing plenty of crises to be resourceful about, with many scientific and technical details provided re both crises and solutions. The protagonist is quite different, at least in superficial respects: a young woman (though it took me a few pages to realize her gender), prickly and foul-mouthed, with firm if idiosyncratic rules for what lines she will and won't cross, entangled in the aftermath of what she freely describes as dumb life decisions. My feelings about Jazz transformed pretty thoroughly as the book went on, from (briefly) irritation and lack of sympathy to wholehearted hope for her success and well-being.

I enjoyed the book's approach to a dual timeline, with the present day alternating with her correspondence with (initially) her off-planet penpal.

The prose wasn't very complicated, making it easy to get through the book fast - however, some of the technical terms for the moon's industries and the space equipment still were hard for me to wrap my head around.

The character of Jazz gave me mixed feelings. I have a lot of respect for her as an interesting woman character, with a compelling backstory, and I enjoyed the counterbalance of her sketchy ethics to her strong sense of honesty and reliability. Even though she wasn't a ""good person,"" she was a good character. I also enjoyed how empowered she was by intelligence, quick wit, and being the leader of the smuggling industry on the moonnot a lot of female characters get such good portrayal!

However, I also didn't really.... like her? She is sort of a disparaging person who interacts with others primarily through brutal honesty, in the form of a lot of deadpan humor and sarcasm. She was almost funny, but a lot of my laughter was half hearted; the one-liners felt forced and unbelievable, and it was baffling for me how easily sheand the other charactersgot away with so much brutal honesty.

I am always up for a good grief and loss book, and The Midnights absolutely fit the bill. It was filled with the pain we associate with losing a loved one, and the ways one may going about trying to fill the hole left in their heart.

Pro: Smetana beautifully depicted the emotional pain experienced by the characters in this book. The grief and suffering was utterly palpable.

Con: I know it's realistic for some people to spin a little out of control when they are grieving, but I had such a hard time with the choices Susannah was making.

Pro: The music references were so awesome. I really loved being pulled into Susannah's musical world, and I was truly fascinated by her songwriting process, her performances, and the bands who influenced her life.

Con: The book was kind of long, and had some parts, which didn't really seem necessary to the story.

Pro: I have been keeping track of where books are set, and it seems like a ton of books are set in California. However, I really thought Smetana's approach to describing the setting was different and interesting. She often focused on the weather elements, and connected them to the musical elements, which was different and a welcomed surprise.

Pro: The Midnight sessions Susannah shared with her father were quite special, and I thought it was brilliant the way these different ""midnights"" kept popping up throughout the story.

Pro: I had quite a fondness for Susannah's grandmother. She was a tough lady, but she was wise, and I really appreciated the way she tried to help Susannah see things from a different angle.

Pro: I was really proud of Susannah towards the end, and loved that she grew up a bit over the course of the story as she healed.

But this is definitely not a Disney Beauty and the Beast style retelling, which was just the way I liked it. The story is told from two unique perspectives and creates an interesting reading experience. I seemed to fly through the book as the drama unfolded. And it is dramatic, since the relationship between Yeva and Beast is the definition of tumultuous. Yet at some points, they do have a chemistry that I enjoyed, just as I have in previous retellings. The only time I was kind of thrown out of the story were at certain slow points in the beginning and right before the climax. That said, I found that the story tied together neatly, though I would have liked to spend a little more time in the magical world. Still, those are personal preferences and I'm glad I got around to reading this book. This definitely read like a classic fairy tale, so I would recommend it to readers who enjoy classic retellings and are looking for a more adult and dramatic take on the tale as old as time.",1521244800,4
7927,170,998,"As a science fiction aficionado, you often find yourself mired in unrelentingly depressing apocalyptic plots, interstellar tales of inter-species genocide, and endless narratives about human technological hubris going awry.  The bulk of the better written and well-plotted SF novels, the ones with big ideas and unique points of view, often explore the darker side of advancement and discovery.  But every story need not plumb the depths of human (or alien) folly, and every novel need not be ground-breaking or award-winning.

Becky Chambers in this first of a series has instead chosen to write in the best tradition of Star Trek--optimistic, strength through diversity and understanding, and humorous.  The analogy bears out in that there is not one main and overarching story line, but rather what feels a bit more episodic with a handful of smaller climaxes that act to introduce us to the crew of the Wayfarer and the universe they exist in.  The captain and about half of the crew is human, but there are also three alien crew members and an AI.  The book opens with Rosemary, the newest member of the crew, on her way to rendezvous with the Wayfarer.  All we know is that she isn't entirely what she seems and that she is trying to escape her past.  As we progress in the book Chambers does an excellent job of fleshing out the crew with insights into their histories and personalities, and uses this as as springboard to also help us explore the Galactic Commons which many sapient races belong to.

While this is not a book that belabors ideas over character and story, Chambers still weaves in serious subjects.  There are discussions related to inter-species romance, respecting the customs of others, the rights of clones and AI, family and belonging, and friendship.  With that, there is action (though not overblown), romance, and hints at galactic political intrigue.  This book makes you wish for crew like that of the Wayfarers' and I look forward to the other books in the series (currently two published, a third due out this summer).",1521244800,5

With a cleverly plotted story line, the history and motives of all the characters are revealed little by little, but the reader is still left wondering who is manipulating whom right up to the shocking and unexpected conclusion. Secrets, lies, blackmail, murder, and revenge all factor into this gripping tale. The story is narrated from several points of view, but without it getting too confusing. The characters are complex and well-developed even if they are not particularly likable. I was drawn into the suspense and intrigue from beginning to end. I enjoyed this well-done psychological mystery and highly recommend it.",1521244800,5

7932,797,722,"Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows should really be renamed Erotic Stories of or from Punjabi Widows.

The story begins with meeting Nikki and her family in London. They are of Indian nationality and have tried to follow the customs of their nationality except that the father let his daughters make their own choices in life. Mindi wanted to try for an arranged marriage to stay with tradition and Nikki didn't know what exactly she wanted to do, but it was not an arranged marriage.

While she's trying to figure out her life, she works in a bar she lives above and also applies to teach what she thinks is a traditional ceative writing class. As it turns out, it is a class to teach older Punjabi woman, most of who are widows, to read and write English. Even though it is not what she thought she was sigining up for, she decides to give it a go only to be surprised that they really have no desire to learn English, but to tell their own stories. Erotic ones.

I will admit that I was not crazy about the first half of this book. It seemed as if the characters were a little superficial and there just wasn't a whole lot of ""meat"" to the story. Thankfully, the second half dove into the characters and the stories behind them making it a far more interesting read.

My favorite thing about this book is that we all have preconceived notions about certain groups of people and these women proved everyone wrong.",1521244800,3
7933,154,1940,"This is a dog book, about a breed of dog that I am familiar with. My sister used to breed Labrador Retrievers. She had the English style of the breed, and there is a difference. Her dogs were calm, did not drool and were easily trainable if you took the time. The dog in this book was hyper, drooled all over the place and challenged training. Still, he was a Lab which means he was a people dog. The book covers the entire 13 years of Marley's life, from his puppyhood to his ultimate death. As proof of his dogness, after his passing, his people got another dog, although not one quite like Marley.

7934,684,191,"This book was never assigned to me in school, so I am reading it for the first time as a middle aged woman with three kids of her own.  That did not affect my enjoyment of the story.  In fact, perhaps I was able to enjoy it even more than I would have if I had been 'forced' to read it.

To begin with, Meg is a very easy character to relate with.  I also very much enjoyed the relationship between her and her little brother.  All of the familial relationships were very realistic, as much as they could be at least within this genre.

I loved the names of the three women who help the kids along their way.  It was fun to read them and I can only imagine that it was fun to write them.  I also really enjoyed the characters met along the journey.  The bad characters were extremely evil, while the pleasant characters were easy to love.

7938,712,594,"""Annihilation"" seems to be the ""buzzy"" sci-fi novel of the moment, one that everyone is clamoring to read.  The premise looked interesting, but I normally shy away from the hyped ""it"" book of the moment until some of the fuss has died down.  But when I learned a movie based on this book was coming out, I figured I should at least read the novel before watching the film.  And... not only do I not see what the fuss is about, nor how anyone could look at this book and consider it movie material, but I can honestly say that I hated it.  Some interesting concepts were completely ruined for me by confusing and pretentious prose, a complete lack of characterization, and a seeming unwillingness by the author to actually explain what the heck is going on.

""Annihilation"" takes place in Area X, an area where some sort of strange event has wiped out the people living there and is slowly turning everything into lush wilderness.  Most of the expeditions sent to explore Area X and determine what happened have had catastrophe of some sort fall upon them, and the current expedition -- four women, known only as the psychologist, the surveyor, the anthropologist, and the biologist (our narrator) -- sets out in an effort to succeed where the others have failed.  The biologist immediately begins to suspect that the psychologist knows more than she's letting on, and that she's hypnotizing the team members for sinister purposes.  But Area X is affecting everyone, including the biologist, in ways they cannot fathom... and it turns out the biologist herself has her own secret ties to Area X, and her own reasons for determining just what happened here...

I was excited to dive into this book and figure out what was going on -- alien invasion?  Science or military experiment run amok?  Gaia's revenge?  Lovecraftian horror?  Don't expect any definitive answers if you do choose to read this -- the novel seems to deliberately go out of its way to not give a definite answer to anything.  Not to the larger mystery of Area X, not to what makes the characters act the way they do... nothing.  Things are hinted at, such as the ""moaning monster"" that stalks the campsite or the large reptilian creatures said to lurk here or a mysterious Tower (really a gigantic tunnel, but the biologist insists in calling it a Tower for some weird reason), but no answers are provided in the book.  I understand that this is the first volume in a trilogy, but come on, the reader expects SOME answers, SOME resolution, even from the first book in a series.

I could have forgiven the vagueness of everything happening had the characters been at all interesting... but no effort is made to make any of the characters relatable or to flesh out their characters.  The biologist gets some hints of characterization, as we do learn her backstory, some of her personality, and her motivation for coming to Area X... but the other characters might as well be robots for all the personality and characterization they get.  Perhaps this was intentional on the author's part to focus the reader's attention on the biologist or to render them unlikable, but it was a stupid tactic on his part... and the biologist herself was so aloof and erratic that I couldn't bring myself to root for her as I read.

Jeff VanderMeer's writing is pretty inconsistent as well.  There are some lovely descriptive bits, but the book alternates between good writing and wooden, stiff prose, often in the middle of a section.  And there are times when the description, instead of proving a clearer picture of what's going on, just serves to confuse the reader.

I honestly can't understand why anyone chose to make a movie out of this -- there's hardly anything here to make a decent film, especially when it seems to deliberately go out of its way to avoid answering any questions the reader might have.  And while I know this is part of a trilogy and some answers need to be saved for future books, baiting the reader into buying the next book by refusing to resolve anything in the current book is a huge cheat in my opinion.  I won't be continuing this series, and unless I hear from a reputable source that the film manages to construct something actually decent out of this bare-bones novel, I probably won't be watching it either.",1521244800,1

The language is a delight; my favorite sentence was this (describing a human): Her hair is thick and brown, the color of a rotten branch teeming with luscious ants.  On half the pages I was teary, on the other half laughing aloud.  After I finished the book, I became aware that I was walking around smiling for a long time, and I kept thinking I looked like a Cheshire Cat, but I couldn't stop.

7942,641,878,"Easily one of my favourite books this year and one of my top favourites by mega-author Neil Gaiman. It was charming, witty, unique, and a little creepy at times. I love the diverse characters in the graveyard and how they support and look after Bod in their own way. Bod is a great character and I loved watching him encounter both living worlds and the dead. There was actually a fair dose of action and suspense and a few twists, all of which lead to a bittersweet ending. The drawings in the book added to the moody atmosphere. All in all, I wanted to spend more time in this wonderfully creepy novel.

The addictive writing is very nicely done and the author presents the most unreliable narrator in recent memory: Amber Reynolds. The plot is compelling and tense, it reminds me very much of one of my old favorites Before I Go to Sleep.

However, I didn't love the ending and I wish to the high heavens that the cast of characters were more complex and illuminated. I'm so done with superficial, twisty for twists' sake and I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT!!! (Insert teardrop here.)

There are plenty of books that offer much more in the way of characterization and believable plot twists. The Flight Attendant, Unraveling Oliver, Sharp Objects The Kind Worth Killing to name a few.

7948,147,1563,"Friday is one of Robert A Heinlein's later novels (1982). The story concerns an AP or artificial person who was ""made"" rather than born. As such, she is enhanced (speed, strength, etc.), but without any legal standing as a human being or citizen of any country. She works as a courier for a secret organization. Her adventures involve both her job as well as her personal life as she struggles to find her place in a world that is largely fragmented, disintegrating around her, and regards her as less than human.

While the main theme of the story is society's approach to artificial people, Heinlein also explores various forms of human relationships, especially the concept of multiple partners engaged in a marriage with ever changing dyadic arrangements. Heinlein always seemed to come down on the side of more sex with more people as a positive improvement and he goes wild a bit with Friday. Along the way, he touches on genetic engineering as a profession, Earth governments fragmenting into smaller and smaller units, and rapid global transport. A faster than light drive is offered along with planetary colonization that features into the plot.

What is real? This question is the one constant of the book and is propelled by the evolution of Anna's character. The way that the author gradually reveals bits and pieces of the characters' lives adds both to the tension and the way that the story moves forward. By incorporating Anna's mental illness and possible delusions, Finn expertly creates a narrative that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. Oh the twists and turns this book takes!

In this book, the Earth is at war with its own environment.  Many of its major cities are already completely under water and many have died.  The best hope for the survival of humanity is to inhabit another planet, or as they decided for this book, Europa, one of Jupiters moons. Twenty Four candidates, between the ages of 16-19, from around the world are selected for specific strengths they inhabit to give the mission its best chance of success.  This number is narrowed down to the Final Six before the mission is to take place.  But all may not be as it seems, and one candidate in particular has many doubts about the true intentions of the space program for this mission.

This book was very interesting, if a bit predictable at times.  There was an adorable romance between two of the candidates and the  explanations about the mission and the condition of the Earth in this book were fascinating to me.  If you dig science fiction with particular interest in space travel I would definitely recommend this book.  It was left open for an obvious sequel.  I am certainly interested enough to read more in the series, though it may not be an auto pre-buy for me.  Overall I give the book 3.5 stars.",1521331200,3
7960,484,1756,"So. I have major beef with Maureen Johnson. I am a huge fan of her, and her writing, and her Shades of London series. I wait in anticipation for each and every new book to come out, and have been waiting year after year for the 4th in the series to be released, except it hasn't been and I don't even know if it ever will. I understand that she's been going through a lot, and of course, priority is herself and her health. My confusion lies in the fact that...well...she left that series unfinished and has now started writing a NEW series! Completely new series! And here's the other thing...it is very similar, in terms of plot and storyline, to the Shades of London series (boarding school, murder, mystery, group of kids trying to get the bad guy and solve a century old mystery?) (except we haven't encountered any ghosts...yet). So what does this mean for Shades of London? Is she done with that? I'd love if anyone who has or knows the answer would share it with me.

Now...to get on with this book review. I am a sucker for YA mysteries, and I do love Johnson's writing style, so obviously I immediately purchased this book. The mystery in this one is quite heartbreaking, involving a 3 year old child, which tugs at my heartstrings. This is a very intricately written book, with so many complex things happening and being built simultaneously. Moving between past and present, you are left in awe at how Johnson maneuvered all the events and put them together in a way that isn't too complicated for the readers to grasp, but still leaves you scratching your head.

The book starts with a prologue, where a student at Ellingham Academy is murdered. That scene is written so well that it made me think of The Lovely Bones and that suffocating scene where Susie gets brutally murdered. We then find out that the school's founder's wife and 3 year old daughter are also missing.

In present day, Stevie Bell enrolls into Ellingham Academy with one goal in mind - to solve the murder mystery that took place back in 1936. Now, I have to admit, I was rolling my eyes at this. A teenager is going to solve a mystery that went unsolved for almost a century. Really? Except, once I got into it and got to know the characters and got to know Stevie better, I didn't even care anymore. I suspended reality and decided to go with the flow, and was completely behind her, supporting her and rooting for her.

The book continues to alternate between past and present as the events of the past are slowly revealed and how the crime was never really solved and the child's body was never found, and how Stevie tries to put it all together in present time, while strange things start to happen mirroring the events of the past.

In the midst of all that, we get to know Stevie's flat mates, friends, family, her likes and dislikes, her insecurities, her love interest (of course) and all the usual high school drama. David is definitely an intriguing character, and I have to admit, I didn't see that one coming, although I should have probably expected it, but I didn't.

This whole book played out like a big set up for what's going to happen in book 2. It introduces you to the murder in the past, then sets you up with a new murder done in the same fashion as the one from the past with a poem by ""Truly Devious"" him/herself, then leaves you with, not one, but TWO killer cliffhangers so you basically have to bang your head against the wall in frustration as you wait until next year for the second installment.

I hope that this is one series Maureen Johnson will see through to the end.",1521331200,5

A very average book, with a very average ""mystery,"" and very average characters.

7964,1078,1838,"*Original review on Goodreads & My Blog*

  Magnalia House was the sort of establishment where only wealthy, talented girls mastered their passion. It wasn't designed for girls who were lacking, for girls who were illegitimate daughters, and certainly not for girls who defied kings. I, of course, happen to be all three of those things.

This book was everything to me! I loved it so very much. Was it full of action and fighting. No, not really and guess what? That's okay!

I have to admit when I first saw the beautiful cover I knew I had to have it and then I read the summary and thought it sounded pretty good and I took the plunge. I just wish I would have gotten to it sooner!

Brienna is brought to Magnalia House when she was ten by her grandfather. Brienna couldn't think why he would take her from the orphanage and bring her to this school. She had no passion she could think of but he wanted to tuck her somewhere safe. So he told the Dowager that she could do a little bit of all the passions: art, music, dramatics, with and knowledge. Well, it didn't go very good. You're supposed to have one passion and study it for 7 years and see if you can find a patron who will get you started in the world.

Brienna ended up going through all of the passions and ending up with knowledge for her last 3 years. Her master was named Cartier and he was a mysterious man. When Brienna and Cartier started talking about Maevana, things started to change. Maevana has a long history of Queens and magic, but many years ago some of the things that helped with this magic was stolen away and the Queen killed along with any survivors. And the King that sits the throne to this day will kill of any rightful heir he might find. They are the Kavanagh family and there is one daughter in hiding, waiting to take back the throne.

When Cartier gives Brienna a book about the stone and some more of the history, she starts having visions. And when everyone leaves the school and she's left without a patron, she finally tells the Dowager about her visions. To Brienna's amazement, the Dowager said she needs to get her with a patron that no one can know about. She can't write to her friends, her grandfather, or Cartier and let them know where she has gone. For she is going to Maevana where is it very dangerous and get that stone to get the rightful Queen back on the throne.

Brienna's patron is a man with the last name of Jourdain ad he takes her on as his daughter. It's all very cloak and dagger stuff, but it must be done and he's very kind to her. And will protect her with his life and he did on the road back home.

  ""One thing you should know about me,"" he murmured, nudging his empty bowl aside. ""If anyone so much as threatens my family, I won't hesitate to kill them.""

  ""I am not even your blood,"" I whispered, surprised by his steely resolve. I had only been his adopted daughter for one day.

  ""You are part of my family. And when the thieves tore apart your things, threw your books in the mud, threatened you . . . I reacted.""

  I didn't know what to say, but I let my gaze remain on his face. My embers of defiance and irritation faded into darkness because the longer I looked upon him, my patron father, I sensed that something in his past made him this way.

  ""Again, I am sorry you had to see such of me,"" he said. ""I do not want you to fear me.""

  I reached across the table, offering my hand. If we were gong to succeed in whatever plans we authored, we would have to trust each other. Slowly, he set his fingers in mine; his were warm and tough, mine were cold and soft.

  ""I do not fear you,"" I whispered. ""Father.""

  He squeezed my fingers. ""Amadine.""

They had to change Brienna's name to keep her in disguise just in case. So he named her Amadine. And she also has a new brother named Luc. They were all very kind to her.

Luc works with Brienna to help her figure out how to get her visions of her ancestors back. She does get more visions and knows where the stone is and how to get it.

She finds out who her father is and that's not a great day.

Brienna also finds love in all of this madness and revelations she never would have believed. She finds hope and a family. It was just wonderful. But you have to read it for yourself to see how you feel as I am but one person.

Happy Reading!

7968,913,1618,"This is another book on the Bill Gates reading list and I have yet to be disappointed.  That said, while I believe that the fundamental premise of this book is fairly intuitive (that violence has declined over the course of history), Pinker suggests that it runs contrary to popular wisdom owing to its glorification by modern media.  Consequently, he embarks on an ambitious and thorough examination of the history of violence through the ages.  The book is readable and informative but (IMHO) was not revelationary.

The book is divided into several parts:
. SIX TRENDS
  - the transition from the anarchy of the hunter / gatherer society
  - the birth of large kingdoms with centralized authority during the middle ages
 -  The age of enlightenment and reason during the 17th and 18th centuries that saw the abolition of socially sanctioned forms of violence
 -  the long peace post World War II as developed states largely stopped waging war
 -  the post.-cold war era where civil wars, genocide and the like have largely subsided
 -  the declaration of human rights, signed in 1948, that has seen a growing level of revulsion and refusal to accept smaller scale aggression and violence against minorities and other helpless parties such and gays, ethnic minorities and the like

FIVE INNER DEMONS
Notwithstanding my inner urge to wage road rage on incompetent drivers, mankind does not have innate urge to commit violence. However, there are certain environmental triggers that propel people to commit violent acts.
-  Predatory or instrumental violence committed as a means to an end
 -  The need for dominance and authority
-  the desire for revenge and the pursuit of justice, whether real or perceived
-  a sadistic pleasure in someone else's suffering
-  an ideology that justifies a violent means to an end.

FOUR BETTER ANGELS
Humans are neither innately evil or innately good but they are receptive to positive motivations, including:
- empathy
- self-control
- morality
- reason",1521331200,4

7970,532,1941,"Meet the Frugalwoods: Achieving Financial Independence Through Simple Living by Elizabeth Willard Thames is a non-fiction book where the author tells of her and her familys journey to early retirement by giving up much of their habits and saving a whopping 70% of their combined income.

As hard as we try, it is sometimes difficult to live frugally, can we try harder?
Absolutely, and it is always nice to get some tips along the way.

In Meet the Frugalwoods: Achieving Financial Independence through Simple Living by Elizabeth Willard Thames one gets some tips, even though many of them are extreme.
But how else are you supposed to save 70% of your income?

To be fair, the author and her husband had a leg up on most of America by graduating college debt free. That is something that 99% of the people I know cannot say.

Another benefit the author had was finding a partner who is equally frugal, with the same goals and the same state of mind. This is an important aspect of family economics and one that, to her benefit, she mentions several times.

Throughout the book there are some great suggestions, which you can implement or not, in order to live more frugally. While 70% savings is impossible for most people, there are many ways mentioned in the book (and some you probably have figured out for yourself, like I did) to make your savings grow.

I have read many investment and finance books, this one is probably one of the most readable and its nice that the author is 100% dedicated to living a frugal life and actually believes what she preaches. While I think my family would have a difficult time adjusting to life with consumerism (not this cheap bastard, but the cheap bastards teenage daughter), there are some good points about the consumerism culture and how its eating up family life and the planets resources.",1521331200,4
7971,292,1893,"While most of the plot elements have been in other recent books, Ashley blends them oh so smoothly in this story. I started it late last night, set it down reluctantly and grabbed it right after breakfast today. Just finished it and closed the cover with mixed satisfaction and anticipation. It ends at the perfect spot for a sequel to begin. Fans of Amy Kaufman/Meagan Spooner's Starbound trilogy will find this a great book to savor. Teens and adults liking a fast paced science fiction story with treachery, mystery and romance will be pleased. It's a great selection for any library to consider.",1521331200,5
7972,198,16,"Quick and readable, this book does a pretty decent job of presenting a teenage girl caught in the middle of a police shooting of an unarmed boy in the ghetto. Although there are a lot of stereotypes on all sides of the controversial issues, the story moves well and has a lot to say without being preachy. Complicated wrongs and rights are shown from several perspectives; there are no easy or pat answers. The violence comes in waves, and family loyalties (of all sorts) are tested to the max. I do wish, however, that an editor might have taken a stronger stance on some of the wasted, casual banter between characters that takes away from the developing tension. A little of that Fresh Prince kind of chit-chat is clever; too much begins to grate. But overall, for a first book, this is a good and thought-provoking one.",1521331200,4

Wow this book is intense! I loved the story line, suspense, and mystery but at the same time hated some of the graphic detail. Sometimes the book was really hard to read and I felt very uncomfortable which is why I didn't fall head over heels in love with this one.

I will say though the story line is absolutely fabulous! Definitely one of the better suspense story lines I have read lately. If your a suspense fan I would definitely give this one a try",1521417600,3

7981,282,1505,"Sometimes I Lie intrigued me as soon as I read Amber Reynolds's three things. Unreliable narrators always fascinate me, and I was curious to see how Amber's story unraveled...why was she in a coma? And why didn't her husband love her anymore?

The end result? Sometimes I Lie took me on a wild, twist-laced ride from start to finish. So many times I thought I had figured everything out; however, Alice Feeney always managed to be prove me wrong, and I was so incredibly grateful for that! I love a book that keeps me on my toes.

Sometimes I Lie is a difficult book to describe. It's one of those mind-twisting thrillers you just need to experience for yourself, but I'll try my best here to describe the reasons why I loved it so much.

For one, Amber is an incredibly compelling character. It's easy to tell that there's something off about her, that there's more to her story than what she's willing to offer. She's never exactly likable ; however, I still became incredibly committed to her story. I wanted her to wake up from her coma. I wanted her to face her demons. I wanted her to fall in love with her husband once again. The quality I liked the most about Amber, however, was her compulsion to lie. It made for an incredibly interesting read, as mentioned above, and it was also interesting to think about why she lied, why she felt that it was so pertinent to surviving.

Sometimes I Lie is split divided into three time periods- journal entries from childhood, now, and before. I thought Alice did such a fantastic job of interweaving all three timelines. Each blended beautifully together, and I always loved/hated when something in one timeline contradicted something in another one. It consistently made me wonder which timeline was true. The plot in Sometimes I Lie is also incredibly fast paced. I read this book on a plane ride to Florida, and I don't think I've ever had a flight go faster. Nothing could distract me from what was at play here - the coma, the lying, the conniving sister, and the scapegoat husband. One aspect I particularly liked about the plot was how Alice utilized relationships to drive things forward. So many events/problems originated from the messed up, codependent relationship between Amber and her sister, and it was juicy to say the least.

I can't end this review without talking about the ending! Alice Feeney BLEW my mind! The last chapter was so incredibly out there, and I couldn't have loved it more. It wasn't the ending I had anticipated and I had to read it twice just to believe it; however, I don't think there could've been a better option.

Overall, Sometimes I Lie is a stellar debut! Now that I've read it I can definitely understand why it's receiving so much praise - it's a must read for sure!",1521417600,4
7982,725,728,"It's been more than a decade since I last readGood Omens (full title: Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch), the collaboration between Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Since then, I've come to know and deeply love the work of Terry Pratchett, and I've become more familiar with the work of Neil Gaiman (who, at the time I last readGood Omens, had only had a couple of novels published). That's made it a perfect excuse to revisit the book, and see how it holds up as a work by two of my favorite writers.

The answer: it holds up perfectly and then some, representing some wonderful union of the best of each author's sensibilities, and creating something wonderful in the process.

Nominally,Good Omensis the story of the Apocalypse, brought about by the birth of the Antichrist. But, in typical Pratchett style, from the get-go, there are reversals and oddities, from the way that the Antichrist is raised by a family who doesn't know what their child is and simply raises him normally to the way the book follows an angel and demon as they attempt to prevent all of this from happening. And through it all, Gaiman fleshes out the mythology and imagination of the piece, playing off of Pratchett's wry social commentary and gleeful silliness.

The result is, first of all, laugh-out-loud, consistently, constantly hilarious, from page one until the end. From a hellhound trapped in the form of a little dog to four bikers who nominate themselves as the followers of the four true Horsemen of the Apocalypse (bikers who have given themselves names like Grievous Bodily Harm, Really Cool People, Things Not Working Even When You've Given Them a Good Thumping, and more), from the wonderful banter between a group of children to the running gag about how every cassette left in a car gradually turns intoQueen's Greatest Hits, Pratchett and Gaiman stuff the book with jokes and silliness, ranging from the profound to the absurd and childish. (My favorite throwaway gag involves a group of ducks that's uniquely attuned to international politics because of all the ""covert"" meetings that happen at their pond.)

But what makesGood Omensgreat isn't the sly parodies ofThe Omen or the wonderful silliness. No, what makes it great is what makes so many Pratchett (and Gaiman, to a different extent) books great: the way it uses the plot to get to something more meaningful and profound. What begins as a book about the end of the world becomes a study of human frailty (the demon Crowley's thoughts about how human nature trumps anything he can ever come up with ring as true today as they did when the novel was first written), but also what makes life worth living. As with so many books by these two, the final confrontation doesn't come down to an action sequence - it comes down to ideas, to optimism (or hope, perhaps) in the face of defeat and cynicism. That's something both men have always been fascinated by, and always brought out in their work - that the world, and people, are so often horrible, and yet there is something magical and essential about life that's impossible to ignore. ThatGood Omensturns that into the text of the novel is what gives is a surprising punch that hits home, even more than any scene of Crowley driving his rapidly disintegrating car or enjoying (what I assume is Gaiman's work) the novel's inspired modernization of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse (and, in one case, one that has never changed, and never will).

It truly is the best case scenario for a collaboration - something that brings out the best aspects in both authors and plays them off of each other, creating something that feels like both of their work and yet feels totally of its own piece. It's funny, it's imaginative, it's profound, and it makes you feel better about the world, even while we recognize the pain of it all. In other words, it's typically brilliant Pratchett and Gaiman in every way.",1521417600,5

7985,292,1838,"Important parts of Brienna's life are mysteries to her. She lost her mother at an early age and was taken in by her maternal grandfather. Every time she asked him about her father, she was told the man wasn't worth her knowing and that ended the conversation. When she turned ten, she was taken to Magnalia House, a training institute for what are called passions, of which there are five: Art, wit, music, dramatics and knowledge. She struggled through four painful years, failing at all but one of them. In her fourteenth year, Brianna was paired with Cartier, the handsome, but enigmatic teacher of knowledge. While her sister students all have seven years to perfect their passion, she only has three and must share Cartier with another student, Ciri. This leaves her both confused and, at times, intimidated. Even so, when it comes time for all the girls to be paired with a patron and receive their passion cloak, she believes she might still be chosen. When she's the only one not selected and Cartier goes on a summer long leave, Brienna feels abandoned and fears she'll never fulfill her destiny.
  However, her destiny not only finds her in the form of a disgraced lord who fled Maevana during a horrific conflict twenty-five years before, she learns, as time goes on, how many friends she has, what her role in the retaking of the Maevanian throne will be and who her father really is.
  Cleverly woven together, this first book by the author is a slower read than many I've enjoyed recently, but that's because of the richness of the details, the characters and the story line. There's plenty of intrigue, bravery, deception and action for teen readers who love fantasy set in a somewhat middle ages world. A good choice for most libraries.",1521417600,5
7986,301,16,"I really liked that the author wrote Starr the way she did. Shes spent just about half her life in some private school surrounded by rich white kids. Then at the end of the day she goes back home to Garden Heights. The way she was able to balance the two worlds was insane. Shed go from talking all prim and proper to her friends at school, to going home and letting her hair down. She never seemed to let those two worlds mesh until at least halfway through the story. Her own boyfriend of over a year had never been to her house. So, I really liked getting to see Starr blend her two worlds together. Heck, the two lives she was living was starting to feel suffocating.

This was seriously a book with a full cast of amazing characters. Everyone from Mr. Reuben who would give kids a free meal for bringing in their report cards, to Mr. Lewis who you thought was just a cranky old man, but was there when stuff hit the fan, Uncle Carlos who ends up in a tough situation when his niece is the witness in the car that his colleague pulled over, even Foty Ounce with his shopping cart full of belongings made an impression on me. All the characters in the story stood out and had a voice of their own. What I liked most about them was their sense of community though. They may all bicker and grumble about the other being nosy, they all seemed to pool together when it mattered most.

I really applaud the author for writing this story. In a time where it seems like theres this great divide, I think its wonderful that she wrote a story about something so monumental. I won't begin to try to understand what Starr and her family go through on a day-to-day basis. However, I can honestly say that seeing all these police brutalities happening lately is extremely upsetting. While I cant claim to know what its like to be Starr, the author was able to shed some light on the matter for me. I couldn't imagine being scared of someone whos sworn to serve and protect me. The fear of always thinking that they will shoot you if you accidentally sneeze or twitch. I just cant grasp what that is like. Sad thing is, this isn't even a fictitious story about unicorns and rainbows, this happens every day in the real world. So, the fact that the author was able to give me the same emotions that Starr had throughout the novel speaks volumes. Its so hard to wrap my head around this story and be able to write a coherent review. All I have to say is READ THIS BOOK NOW!",1521417600,5

7988,460,1892,"Why has it taken me so long to read Caroline Linden? This was my first read by her, and it was so fun. I loved the heroine, Sophie. She's a feisty, smart, independent woman. She is the granddaughter of a viscount, so she has aristocratic ties, but her father was a disowned second son, and once she's orphaned, her granddad dumps her at boarding school. (At school, she makes friends with two ladies, Eliza & Georgiana, who are mostly minor secondary characters in this book, but they'll get their own stories in the series.) Sophie used to watch her father gamble, and she's good at math/counting cards, so when she has to make it on her own she becomes a professional gambler.

The hero, Jack, is a great match for her. He starts off as the stereotypical stuffy duke who's trying to wrangle his worthless brother, but she softens him and really brings out his sensitivities and emotions. Also, it's clear that he likes that she's strong and smart, and he doesn't stifle her or try to change her.

This was a great start to the Wagers of Sin Series! I'm looking forward to Eliza & Hugh's story next, and hopefully Mr. Dashwood, the owner of the Vega Club, will find romance at some point, too!

7989,662,1510,"The Wife is a very timely novel as it deals with a seemingly happily married man, accused by two female colleagues of sexual harassment, and the wife who stands by him.  In one chapter Id be completely convinced of his guilt, in the next Id be sure the charges were completely trumped up, in the next Id be back to Guilty!!  And so it went until the very end.  Honestly, I never saw the end coming.

7990,301,1895,"I loved the concept of this story and the fact that when Prince Thabiso meets Naledi for the first time at her place of employment, she mistakes him for her new co-worker and puts him to work. Can you imagine a Prince catering an event himself? Picture dropped dishes, spilled drinks, and fondue a la blaze. Needless to say, he does not make a great first impression on Naledi. However, when he moves in next door to her, she finds herself warming up to him. She has no idea that his name isn't really Jamal (the kid who was supposed to show up for work that day) or the fact that he is the Prince that those annoying emails keep mentioning.

I found both of the characters both strong and annoying. You see, Naledi is always at the ready to write someone off. She has this hang-up from being a foster kid that everyone will leave you. So, she continues to hold Thabiso at arms length. Prince Thabiso goes to New York with good intentions but quickly takes a turn into creepersville. I mean, instead of correcting Naledi when she mistakes him for someone else, or even later when they are neighbors, he continues on with the ruse. He even goes so far as to sleep with her when she has no idea what his real name is. That really bothered me. So, I wasn't overly upset when Naledi freaked out and gave him the boot.

A Princess in Theory was a delightful read. I thought the story would just be the two of them building a connection under false pretenses but that was only half the story. I loved that the author took us on an adventure and made the story more than it seemed.",1521417600,3
7991,796,1933,"Census was a quick and somewhat unusual read  but, I liked it very much.

The story begins with an unnamed man digging his own grave. The man, a widower, a former surgeon is gravely ill and his concern is not what is about to happen to him but, what will happen to his son who has Down's Syndrome.

The man decides to take a job as a census taker for the government and father and son take to the road in an unnamed country, visiting various counties (A-Z). Each chapter is short and represents one of the counties along their journey and the individuals they meet, on what will be their final journey together.

7992,567,1897,"I'm shamefully behind on my Lisa Kleypas historical series (The Hathaways might have been my last reads from her?) but have good memories of them, so when I got a chance to read Hello Stranger with a doctor heroine and spy hero, I jumped at the chance. Though the fact that the heroine has a male name (neatly explained early on, but still...) continued to throw me for a loop all book long, this book was a lot of fun to read. Kleypas gave our hero some of the best lines ever, like

The first moment I saw you, I knew you were my share of the world. Ive always loved you. If I could choose my fate, Id never be parted from you. Acushlapulse of my heart, breath of my soultheres nothing on this earth more fair and fine than you. Your shadow on the ground is sunlight to me.

(that one while he was literally on death's door!) and

He knows that where you're concerned, Ihavea preference. Guiding her past the palms, he opened the service door and took her to the landing of a servants stairwell...

...Preference, Garrett repeated cautiously. What does that mean? You prefer me to what?

As they stopped in a corner, Ethans head and broad shoulders were silhouetted in the faint glow of a sconce on the opposite wall. She began to tremble as he stood over her, big and dark, his nearness awakening a pulse of high music in her.

I prefer you to everything, he said gruffly, and bent to take her mouth with his.

I mean, really. Could anyone possibly mount a defense against lines like that, I ask you?

I resisted the urge to look up 1870s medical procedures and knowledge, so I have no idea how accurate they are in the book, but OMG Kleypas absolutely used them to great effect here. Between the major medical emergency and the suspense drama--along with the aforementioned swoony bits--this one was nearly impossible to put down.

Thank goodness it was a Sunday ;)

Hello Stranger is the fourth book in The Ravenels series, but worked just fine as a standalone--the Ravenels were very much secondary characters for most of the book; West, who hasn't had a book yet, has the biggest role here...and OMG, does his part have me sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting for his book to come out?

Yes. Yes, it does.

8000,138,930,"Robert Harris new novel, Munich, is notable for arguing that rather than appeaser of Hitler, Chamberlain in fact recognized Great Britains weak military position, that Britain required time to build up its land and air forces, that the British people lacked the appetite for another, far worse all out world war, especially over what many saw as an entirely continental dispute, and that Britain, should war come, could do little to thwart Hitlers conquest of Czechoslovakia. It also has the virtue of reminding us that resistance to Hitler existed, in particular during the very time of the Munich diplomatic efforts to forestall war, in the form of the Oster Conspiracy (Generalmajor Hans Oster, deputy head of Abwer, German military intelligence).

Munich takes place during the four days surrounding the signing of the Munich Agreement, September 29, 1938, as Chamberlain and the British government prepare to fly to Germany. Number 10 Downing Street buzzes with activity as PM Chamberlain and staff prepare for their upcoming meeting with Hitler, Mussolini, and Daladier (France). Among the diplomatic service staff is a junior member, Hugh Legat, a fictional character. He expects to help assemble materials for the meeting and then remain in London. To his, and others, surprise, he finds himself selected to accompany the mission. The request for his presence comes through secret communication from Berlin. Another young junior diplomat, Paul von Hartmann, of the German Foreign Ministry, through his highly placed cohorts has originated the request. Paul and Hugh both attended Oxford, Balliol College. They spent a summer together in the Munich area early in the decade in the company of a young German girl, girlfriend to Paul but who also had a brief romance with Hugh. Paul wants Hugh in Munich so that he might deliver to him a report attributable to Hitler stating in no uncertain terms the dictators intentions not only in Czechoslovakia but also going forward into the 1940s. Paul and his fellow conspirators believe that if they can prevent Chamberlain and the others from signing a peaceful transfer of the Sudetenland to the Nazis, the Wehrmacht will overthrow Hitler and thus save Germany from, as they see it, an unwinnable war. The novel focuses on the machinations and dangers faced by Paul in getting the message into Pauls hands, and thereafter from Paul to Chamberlain. This message serves to reinforce the idea that while Chamberlain might be viewed as an appeaser, he might also be seen as a cool-eyed realist.

Harris, a master at suspense and detailed research, excels at recreating the atmosphere surrounding one of the most important meetings in 20th century world history, from the landscape and architecture of Munich, to the food consumed, down to the operation of the diplomatic corps. He also paints intriguing portraits of not only the key historical figures, but to many lost in the dust of history. While you may or may not agree with Harris revised portrayal of Chamberlain, youll surely enjoy the ride provided by his very good historical suspense novel.",1521417600,4

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Fantasy

Series: Untitled Trilogy, book one

Star Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

I found this book the way I usually find my library books; a recommendation from the newest books of January. I was intrigued by the plot, as well as the gorgeous, colorful cover. So as soon as I had an opening in my library stack, I ordered it, waiting impatiently. It got pushed to the top of my stack after another library overhaul, and I dove in, excited for this debut, rife with magic, mythology, political intrigue, forbidden love, and thrilling adventureThe Queens Rising is one of my favorite books of 2018, and I cant wait for the sequel! It had almost everything I love in a debut novel, and I was so excited to find out that this book was the first in a projected trilogy! Newcomer Rebecca Ross has absolutely outdone herself with this new spin on a high fantasy novel!

Brienna is a fatherless child, sent to the passion academy in Magnalia to train in one of the noble arts: music, art, dramatics, wit, or knowledge. Seven years on, she has found her passion, after dabbling in each: knowledge. The goal of a passion is to attain a patron who can take them under their wing. Brienna is terrified that she will not find someone to properly nurture her talents, and when the solstice comes, her worst fear comes true. To add to her stress, she is plagued by mysterious visions, hailing back to a time before the country was even formed. When a disgraced, enigmatic man offers her patronage, she accepts, though suspicion is at the forefront of her mind. She is soon drawn into a dangerous, seductive web of political intrigue, personal secrets, magic, and war, and she must decide which side shes on: passion or blood. The choice could turn the tide of her life and the war.

I really, really enjoyed this book! What a beautifully written, thrilling debut! I was absolutely entranced; the worldbuilding was excellent, the beautiful writing, the breakneck pacing, and the characters were memorable. Rebecca Ross has become one of my new favorite authors with this lovely book, and I cant wait for the sequels! It wasn't perfect; there were times when I was confused about the timelines lining up, and despite there being a dramatis personae, all of the characters and their aliases got confusing. But nonetheless, this debut was really solid! Brienna was my favorite character of the book, doubtful and unsure at first, growing into a powerful, driven and ambitious woman who isn't afraid to stand for what she believes in and who she loves. I loved the world that she inhabited, where the arts were as highly valued as being a warrior, whether one was male or female. The pacing was insane; divided into different parts, going old school, even with a good old table of contents, I was absolutely spellbound, and there were times when I couldn't stop thinking about it, even when I was in the middle of something else. The ending was heartbreaking, explosive, and satisfying; this book was very enjoyable! It had everything youd expect in a great high fantasy and more, with feminist, powerful characters to boot! Highly recommended! The bottom line: A gorgeously written, beautifully wrought fantasy chock full of my favorite things, I loved The Queens Rising, and I cant wait for more from this promising new author! Next on deck: Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard!",1521504000,4
8003,396,1892,"I have read several Caroline Linden books in the past and I've enjoyed all of them, but My Once and Future Duke has surpassed all of them and is by far my favorite of this author's books. Everything about this book worked for me! First off, the heroine was perfect. From being the disowned granddaughter of a viscount to growing up and making a living through gambling Sophie was so much fun to read about. I just found her character so fascinating and she really made this book a win for me. As for Jack, he was your typical historical romance hero and in this case being typical and what I expected was a good thing because he was exactly the type of hero I love to read about when I pick up a historical romance novel. On top of two wonderful leading protagonist, the way that the author presented the love story was really something. I really loved the way that everything progressed between these two from the initial wager to them admitting their love for each other. Everything about their relationship just made me so happy. And given how happy their relationship made me, I really loved that their romance was the sole focus of this historical romance. Often in historical romance, their is always so many other things going on from conniving relatives to murder mysteries and while I do enjoy those types of stories as well, I was happy that we didn't have all that extra conflict in this book. This book was a sweet and simple love story and I really enjoyed it. As I said at the beginning of this review this is by far my favorite Caroline Linden book and I really recommend it!",1521504000,5
8004,278,1943,"Well, this might be the most unique book I've read in a long time. Unique can either have good or bad connotations and, although I'm leaning towards good, I'm not 100% convinced with this story.

The biggest part of that indecision is that I almost always want my questions answered by the end of a story - and, in this case, that does not happen. There are open-ended trails in this book that I have to complete. But right now, this instant, I think I enjoyed this tale.

Tracy Sue Petrikoff is 17 years old. Her mother was struck by a car and killed a year ago, leaving behind Tracy, her dad, and her younger brother Scott. They live in Alaska on ten acres her grandfather built on, surrounded by thousands more acres of undeveloped Alaskan wilderness.

Even though it's not hinted at much in the blurbs of this book, this is a horror story. I won't tell you WHY it's a horror story but it is.

Strange characters, strange happenings, strange story - but I think I enjoyed it.

I received this book from William Morrow Books through Edelweiss in the hopes that I would read it and leave an unbiased review.",1521504000,4
8005,693,1897,"An amazing 5 stars for Lisa Kleypas' Hello Stranger! This has been truly one of the best books of 2018, a tale that kept me turning the pages long into the night! I immediately fell in love with Dr. Garrett Gibson's characters, she is gutsy, strong, and knows what she wants. She is also very sweet and loving! I also really enjoyed reading about a female doctor, who challenged all those around her and the times in which she lived. She a very relatable character that I feel many women will feel drawn to. Also, our hero of the tale, Ethan Ransom who is also very strong, yet very sexy and passionate. He's also a very secretive man, a former detective for Scotland Yard, and soon readers will know all that's hidden within.

Kleypas' writing is as impeccable as always, I just absolutely love how she draws the reader in and really gives them a true, deep look into the characters lives, one can't help but feel they know the characters. She also throws many twists and turns with lots of tension throughout the book and really takes her readers and her characters on quite the ride. An amazing author that I highly recommend to anyone! I absolutely loved Hello Stranger and can't wait to read more of the Ravenels' in coming books!",1521504000,5
8006,319,191,"Have you ever had a book that sat on your to read list for twenty years and you aren't quite sure why?  A Wrinkle in Time is just such a book for me.  My little sister Katie highly recommended it to me while I was in college and even loaned me her copy, but I never got a chance to read it.  Its always been in the back of my mind, and with the new movie coming out, it seemed like now was the perfect time to read it.

This book has time travel and a female protagonist, which would have been totally up my ally as a teen / pre-teen, Im not sure how I missed it.  Originally published in 1962, I am amazed at how this book is before its time.  Not only is the main character of this sci-fi novel a female, but her mother is also a PhD scientist that works as an equal partner with her husband.  Very cool.

Meg never fits in anywhere.  Besides feeling that she looks odd and she doesnt like the regular material at school, her father vanished without explanation years before causing much talk around town.  After a mysterious visitor appears, Meg together with her brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin, travel through time and space to find her father.

I loved that the story not only was a cool time travel story, but was also a great coming of age story as Meg tries to find and like herself.  I really liked the explanation of the travel through space and time using drawings.

Favorite Quotes:

Yes.  I believe that they do.  But I think that with our human limitations were not always able to understand the explanations.  But you see, Meg, just because we don't understand doesnt mean that the explanation doesnt exist.

A book, too, can be a start, explosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly, a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.  a quote from LEngles Newbery Medal Acceptance Speech from 1963.  It is a wonderful speech about the love of reading and the love of fantasy/sci-fi.  Its worth reading on its own!!

Overall, A Wrinkle in Time is a classic sci-fi / fantasy novel that deals with time travel, and also understanding yourself and what it means to love.  I thought it was a great unique story, especially for the time it was written.  Its interesting how many tales that came after it borrowed parts of it.  I think the movie looks really interested and I cant wait to see it!

8008,170,1399,"4.5 stars.  I simply adore this series.  Chambers manages that precarious balance of weighty, existential topics (like sapience, purpose, survival, belonging) with a wholesomeness that is neither childish nor cloying.  Even where characters might fit into well worn tropes, she gives them depth and individuality.  The entire book just feels good-natured in a way that is hard to find without feeling like you're being patronized.

While the first book in the series (The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet) took place on a tunneling ship, the Wayfarer, this second book takes place mostly on Port Coriol.  The link between the books is the Wayfarer's former AI, Lovelace (better known as Lovey).  If you haven't read the first book stop right there because the next bit will spoil the ending.  Anyway, at the end of the first book, Lovey had sustained major damage and the only way to perhaps restore her was a hard shutdown, with a 50/50 chance she would return to her Lovey personality as opposed to starting over from scratch.  Sadly for the entire crew, she reverted to Lovelace.  At the end of that book, friend of the crew Pepper (a skilled tech) had offered Lovelace the opportunity of entering into a body kit (highly illegal), and the chance to leave the crew who were mourning the loss of Lovey.  Lovelace accepted and this novel explores her attempt to live in a body and find purpose beyond her specs.

This rebirth and self-discovery finds a very effective and heart-wrenching counterpoint in alternating chapters that explore Pepper's background.  We got hints of this in the first book in the series--we know she was some kind of designed human, meant to fulfill very specific tasks and not to deviate, and that she endured a harrowing trip to escape her fate.  Here her history is elaborated with poignant detail and, over time, we come to realize why Pepper was so determined to give Lovelace a chance at another life.

The highest compliment I can give this book is that, despite loving the first book and being anxious to hear what happens next with the Wayfarer's crew, it took me less than a chapter to be entirely absorbed and not at all resentful that the Wayfarer plays no meaningful role in this novel.  Highly recommended.",1521504000,5
8009,248,1943,"Alaska seems to be the hot setting for novels these days and Bradbury makes very effective use of her setting.  This is a hard book to review because I'm still not sure what the real story is with Tracy- is this a horror story?  Is it paranormal?  I don't know but I do know that I enjoyed it.  Tracy and her family are subsistence mushers who have been knocked for a loop by her mother's death along the side of a road.  This is the not pretty side of Alaska even before you know how Tracy treats animals she traps.  She very much loves her dogs, however, and lives to work with them (as well as to hunt.). This is not your standard 17 year old.  The arrival of Jesse changes things up for the family (which includes her brother Scott).  I don't want to give spoilers because this is the sort of novel where things build.  Little clues.  Little hints. I was distracted at first by how this is written but it makes sense since Tracy is the narrator.  This is a very well done debut.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC. Recommend this for Alaska fans as well as for those open to a unique character.",1521504000,5
8010,275,1943,"The Wild Inside by Jamey Bradbury is an unusual paranormal novel about a young woman who lives in Alaskan wilderness.

Seventeen year old Tracy Petrikoff loves the outdoors. She is an avid hunter with an unusual proclivity for the animals she kills. Her family is heavily involved with dog sledding but following her mothers death,  they struggle financially after her father gives up mushing and sells the majority of their sled dogs. Tracy keeps hoping to change his mind about her competing in upcoming mushing events, but after she is suspended from school for fighting, her dad grounds her from taking care of the remainder of their dogs and roaming the woods surrounding their home. Headstrong and stubborn, Tracy defies him to check her traps but on one of her outings, she is suddenly attacked by a stranger in the forest. When the man, Tom Hatch, shows up at her home not long after their encounter bleeding from a knife wound, Tracy is afraid she is responsible but her memories of their first meeting are somewhat vague.  After her father hires drifter Jesse Goodwin to work in exchange for board, Tracy befriends him and she soon discovers Jesse is hiding many secrets.

Tracy is the novels sole narrator and she is not exactly a likable or sympathetic protagonist. She is rather selfish, very impulsive and extremely defiant. She greatly misses her mother who completely understood her daughters need to hunt and freely roam the surrounding woods. Tracy inherited her moms abnormal need for hunting and ability to psychically connect to animals and people in the aftermath of quenching her bizarre appetite.

The book summary is a little misleading since there is no mention of a paranormal element to the storyline. While this aspect is not overpowering, it does factor heavily into the plot.  The hunting scenes are graphic but it is what Tracy does after the animals are dead that might make readers squirm.

While the novel is well-written, Tracy does speak have a bit of a backwoods dialect. A lack of quotations marks during conversations is rather irritating. The storys setting is quite rustic and isolated but Jamey Bradburys descriptive prose makes it very easy to visualize the surrounding forest.

The Wild Inside is a slow-paced adventure that has unexpected supernatural/paranormal elements.  The suspense aspect of the plot is quite interesting  and Jesse is an intriguing addition to the cast of characters. However, Tracy makes such horrible decisions that she is unlikable and ultimately, irredeemable. A unique but very strange debut that is well researched and features a beautiful setting that is mish-mash of suspense, horror and paranormal genres.

I received a complimentary copy for review.",1521504000,3
8011,827,790,"This is a well written novel about a village in Africa in the 1800s which is taken over by missionaries and other white men from England.  The story centers on one man and his family, and how they are affected by the intrusion into their culture and long held traditions.",1521504000,4
8012,888,27,"Jackie Reed has 2 sons,  Wade and Connor.  She is divorced from their father, Bill.  When their sons were very small, he fell in love with a much younger woman whom he called the love of my life.  They married and now have 3 daughters.  While Bill pays monthly child support, he has not seen his sons in many years.

Jackie works at a real estate agency.  She is concerned about Wade as he looks tired and perhaps stressed over school.

She learns that Liam, a high school student around Wades age, has been run down by a car.  He later dies.  The car had been hijacked by a teen boy who then sped off striking Liam who had tried to come to the aid of the woman from whom the car had been stolen.

Since the town of Havenkill is relatively small, so is their police force.  Pearl is a police officer but not necessarily a happy person.  Her partner is a young officer who grew up in the same town, knows a number of people, but tends to jump to conclusions about someones guilt or innocence.

The story follows Wade and Connor as the finger of suspicion points to Wade as the possible suspect of Liams death.  Their school mates begin to pick up on the suspicion and friends drop away and start accusing Wade on social media.  Wade does seem to be hiding something but Jackie is having a hard time getting him to talk to her even though she does her best to tell him she believes he is innocent.  Or is he?

This is a good story that shows the involvement of many in the community and the loss of Liam.  Who is the guilty person and why was he killed?

I thought I had this figured out but found out at the end that I was totally wrong.  Do read this book and see if you and decide whodunit.",1521504000,4

But it also has a character that is connected to one of the spies living after WWII and her story is woven together with the earlier storys timeline. And its done extremely well. Character development is superb. You fall in love with characters, hate some of them, are extremely sad when you lose others, and wish you had met those that are mentioned and spoken about. I highly recommend this book.",1521504000,5
8014,3,1932,"Calvin Fisher has left the Amish faith after a terrible childhood.  His older brother, Mark, was the one who raised him.  At the age of 14 Calvin left Horse Cave, Kentucky and began a descent into a life of alcohol and drugs.  Now, he has cleaned up his act.  He works for the DEA as an informant in exchange for them paying debts he owed to a gang.  Calvin is still a member of the gang, but he secretly reports information to the DEA.  The only way out of the gang is death, so Calvin knows he has a dim future and short life ahead of him.  He has kept his distance from his brother in the past, but recently they had somewhat of a reconciliation.  He doesnt want Mark or Marks wife to become a potential target for the gang, so he stays away.
Calvin receives a telephone call from his sister-in-law telling him Mark is very sick with kidney cancer and she needs Calvins help with Mark.  Calvin returns home and becomes interested in the neighbor across the street, Alice Yoder.  Alice is a preschool teacher who is house-sitting for her brother while he is on vacation.  She finds Calvin attractive and accepts him at face value.  She doesnt know he is involved in a gang or what he must do as a member of the gang.  Soon, criminal activity is on the up rise in Horse Cave.  Has Calvins gang decided to move in or are they just checking up on him to make sure he is doing what he said he would do?  Is the gang doubting his loyalty?  Alice even has some scary encounters and her school is vandalized.  Is Calvins gang responsible?
This is a story that will get readers involved from page one.  Shelleys writing is such that it draws readers in with easy prose and likeable characters.  Calvins protectiveness of Alice was admirable.  He was so gentle with her, but so tough with his gang.  He had a difficult time when people still thought the worst of him because of his past, but he couldn't tell them he had changed as he was undercover.  Alice believed in him as a person not based on his job.  Im looking forward to book five that will be released July 2018 to see what is new in Hart County!",1521504000,5
8015,506,1916,"Humans have trashed the Earth. Climate change has raised the oceans and drowned many cities. Humanity's last best hope is to choose a team of six teenagers to go on a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa to terraform it for a new home for humanity.

This book tells the story of the twenty-four kids who will be competing for the six spots. The book is told from two points of view.

Leo is an orphan from Rome who lost his parents and beloved younger sister when when a tsunami wave hit Rome. As the story begins, he is getting ready to die himself since he has no more hope. He has been chosen to represent Italy primarily for his swimming ability. He has a positive attitude about going to Europa because it will help humanity and there is nothing left on Earth for him.

Naomi is a science nerd. While her family has had to move to higher ground a couple to times, she still lives with her parents and her beloved younger brother who has a defective heart. The last thing she wants to do is go permanently to Europa and leave her family. She doesn't have a choice, though, because being chosen is equivalent to being drafted. All the kids are also told that if they deliberately try to be sent home, they will be prosecuted and imprisoned.

This story follows the training the kids go through including injections that are supposed to help them survive on Europa. Noami's roommate has a bad reaction to the injections and washes out of the program. Another of the candidates goes crazy which Naomi believes is because of the injections but the kids are told that he had a previously undiagnosed psychological issue. Naomi becomes more and more sure that the kids aren't being given the whole story and begins to do some research using hacking software her brother slipped to her as a going away present.

She and Leo begin a friendship which leads to a romance even though he is still convinced that the mission is a good one even while Naomi becomes more and more sure that it is not. There are also interpersonal problems for the kids to deal with two. Leo's rival for the dive expert on the mission is Beckett Wolfe who happens to be the nephew of the President of the United States. He is willing to do anything to sabotage Leo's chances including an attempted murder.

The story was exciting, action-packed and had a nice romance. It also begins a series. I have read a few similar books recently. THE COUNTDOWN CONSPIRACY by Katie Slivensky, NYXIA by Scott Reintgen, and UNEARTHED by Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner all have a similar themes for science fiction fans who want more while waiting for book 2.",1521504000,4

8018,955,1897,"After meeting over a surgical table in Devil in Spring, we finally have Dr. Garrett Gibson and Ethan Ransom's story!

Dr. Gibson is waylaid by rape-y drunk soldiers on the way home from helping deliver a baby. She has her trusty cane and her fencing skills, but three against one is still a tall order. Swooping in to ""rescue her,"" depending on who's perspective you take, is the man who has secretly been making sure she makes it home every night.

Both annoyed at the enforced chivalry but wildly intrigued and attracted to Ethan Ransom, Garrett agrees to Ethan's request to give her proper self-defense training. He also gifts her a silver police whistle, just in case.

Ethan has been in love with Garrett since she saved Lady Pandora's life, but his dangerous occupation means he needs to stay away from her. He just can't and unfortunately his weakness is exploited by the man who hold's his very life in his hands.

A gunshot wound, a secret plot to blame Irish Nationalists for violence, and family ties make this an exciting and highly sexy continuation of the Ravenal Series.

I adore Kleypas's historical details, especially regarding Garrett's medical skills. It often reminded me of the Outlander series, just 100 years later in time. It was fun to see an Irish brogue-ed hero, and a Dr. Quinn-medicine woman type character find true love. All of the conflict made sense and I liked that lies did not create the drama.

I'm also super excited to read West's book! There is quite a lot of West, and he become quite endearing to me.

I did notice the problematic passage detailing how Ethan gained his sexual prowess, basically exploring the Kama Sutra with an Indian woman. Definitely did not need this for the story and frankly I'm tired of it. I appreciate Kleypas's statement on fixing this in future copies of this book.",1521504000,4

I laughed, cried, got really mad, applauded and sometimes felt like I was on quite the emotional roller coaster. Covering serious issues of racism, police brutality, class, drugs, gangs, domestic violence, and the justice system, while placing them against the backdrop of families, friends and communities with real relationships was brilliant.

8021,864,1794,"I don't know how I missed that this book was part of a loosely bound series  although perhaps series is too formal a word. It continues along the lives of characters from other books, fills out other characters story lines and introduces others. The book starts with the love story of Edith and Joseph; two people very much in love who build a place of refuge and peace within the walls of their house on the water.

The book then moves to the present as Clare is about to get married  but she is experiencing more than cold feet. She has far too many reservations about her fiance but doesnt feel she can just stop things at this juncture. As she worries and frets she is consoled by her childhood friend and oddly enough by a stranger; a woman who happens to be at the resort where the wedding is to be held. This woman gives Clare the strength to make her decision.

As Clare goes on with her life she soon receives word that the woman she met for that one weekend has died and left her a house. Clare goes to the house, Blue Sky House  Edith and Josephs house  to find refuge and what she finds is Edith and her story.

This is the kind of book that stays with you long after you read it. The characters are so real you feel like you know them and you want to spend time with them. Neither Clares nor Ediths story really dominates as each feeds the other.  As Clare learns about the history of her unexpected gift she also starts to learn about the mystery woman who so altered her life.  Its a story that is full of love and loss, passion and sorrow. but most of all happiness and fulfillment. There is much to learn from a live well lived with a person you love.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ill Be Your Blue Sky even when it wasn't always easy to read. It covers some of the worst of relationships but yet love does triumph. One has to always hold on to that.

8026,263,755,"This is a combination of a narrative poem and a collection of morality poems. The story of the narrative poem is that a wise man (i.e. the Prophet), Almustafa, is about to sail away from his recent -- but temporary -- home on Orphalese, and hes asked to speak on a range of topics so the people of Orphalese can gather his wisdom before he goes.

In 26 chapters, the prophet expounds on each topic upon which he is questioned. Topics include relationships, possessions, laws, religion, teaching, and death.  The wisdom presented is practical, profound, and reflects a mystic sentiment (i.e. the idea that the divine is within us rather than something separate.)  This is an extremely quotable volume. Among his responses, the Prophet says that one should not be too controlling in relationships, that one should not live life under the dictates of fear,  that its not for one to determine what is moral for another, and that one should not engage in morality or worship for show.

8027,637,1540,I realize I am a true fan of the author Sara Gruen. This is my third book of hers and Ive enjoyed every one. This is an interesting read. Sort of a historical fiction love story during war time with a little magical realism thrown in. It can be slow going at first as she delves deep into the characters and setting to set the stage.

8035,816,1778,"About That Kiss is the fifth book in the Heartbreaker Bay series, of which I have only read one book. While these may technically be read as standalones, I felt like I was missing info and wish I had read all the earlier books first. There is quite a bit of character crossover and references to their stories (particularly the fateful fountain) and, as I didn't know everyone, I felt like I was the clueless new kid on the block.

So this story is about a kiss (duh) that seems to have happened off-page... or maybe in a previous book? We start off the story two days after the kiss has happened. I wish that scene had been included in a prologue or something because I felt like I was coming into the story late. So the gist is that our heroine (Kylie) and hero (Joe) had a steamy, possibly drunken, kiss at a bar. Then he didn't call her, but comes into her reclaimed wood store a couple days after.
Kylie Masters is a woodworker, making pieces for a quaint store called Reclaimed Wood. She is following in her grandfather's footsteps, who was a master woodworker and raised Kylie. This is pretty unique for a heroine, so I liked that aspect and envied her creative/crafty ability. Sometimes Kylie seemed anti-romance, but then there were also mentions about her huge crush on her boss, Gibbs. She has a close-knit group of girlfriends, which I also envied. (It's so hard to find a good girl posse as an adult! But I digress.)

Joe Malone is kind of a tortured hero. He is also anti-romance, but it has more to do with how he seems himself than what he really has to offer a mate. But Joe espouses all the characteristics of a good hero. He is tough and capable, protective, caring, and a little bit vulnerable. After a rough childhood, Joe is working in the investigation and security field with some of the earlier heroes of the series (I think). He also takes care of his mentally ill father and slightly disabled sister, and has served as the bedrock of the family from a young age.

The romance between these two was at arm's length much of the time. They tried to deny their feelings, were deathly afraid of the town wishing fountain, but ultimately give in to the chemistry. I thought they were pretty good when they were together, but neither had the courage to communicate with the other. Luckily they had the investigation to fall back on, as that kept pushing them together as I'm sure they would have never talked otherwise.

I didn't feel like there was a lot of character development in this book, and it kept me from connecting with either character. In fact, the heroine kinda got on my nerves. So I'm thinking that there may have been some character building throughout the series that I missed, as I don't recall this being an issue in other Shalvis books that I've read. I also felt like the suspense aspect was a bit weak. If I am reading romantic suspense, I tend to want the heart-pounding action and suspense... where this one was just a little mystery investigation.

So while I usually like Jill Shalvis' books, this one was just okay for me. It didn't hold my interest well and I kept taking breaks during my roadtrip to listen to other books.",1521504000,3

8044,96,1843,"It's an annual event for me to pick up the new Serge Storms novel early in the year by buying it at a live appearance by Tim Dorsey. This time he walked into the Barnes and Noble looking visibly shaken and announced that there would be no humorous introduction or reading as us usual. Why? This was in South Florida and Tim was staying at the local hotel where parents were gathering to see if their kids were any of the 17 killed at Stoneham Douglas high and he observed the tension and heartbreak in the lobby.

For those of you not familiar with this series (this is the 21st), the principal character is Serge Storms, a serial killer who only harms those who would injure Florida or Florida's vulnerable members of the populace. He always arranges to give the bad guys an out but so far, none seem to take advantage of it.

8045,202,1756,"Ill read the second book in the series when it comes out but I cant quite put my finger on whether or not I actually enjoyed this one.

I first picked up the book because of the cover, which is a bright blue background and has large white letters for the title. I promised myself I wouldnt buy another book at the time, but I kept coming back to it. Finally I was able to snag it at the library.

In 1936, Albert Ellingham built an elite private school (but tuition-free!) in Vermont for children of all ages to practice their own interests, to engage in puzzles, read books, and really explore the world around them. Being a fun of mazes and riddles, the campus is also home to a multitude of hidden nooks and crannies. However, she and Iris, her mother, were kidnapped and held for ransom. Iriss body was recovered a few weeks later, but not Alices. The only clue left behind was a mocking riddle from Truly Devious, a pseudonym.

Decades later, Stevie Bell has arrived on campus and is eager to solve the crime. Fancying herself an amateur sleuth, she believes that she has found the missing link to clear the alleged killers name and bring the real one to justice. Then, its onto the FBI, where her real life can begin. Before she can crack open the old case, however, she has to adjust to being away from home, learn how to make friends, and manage her anxiety.

I thought Stevie was a good character. She was strong and embraced her differences, but not at the expense of belittling females who are interested in make-up or being a cheerleader  which is also what her conservative, traditional parents want her to be. I didn't care too much about the other characters. I didn't think we spent enough time with them to really gauge their personalities, and I wished that we were shown more of Janelle and Stevies friendship. Good female friendships are hard to come by!

My issue was also with pacing. The book is set across two timelines: 1936 and present day, with a murder mystery in each one. The problem was, we didn't get to the murder in the present day period until halfway through the book. I felt like in that regard, it took too long for the story to get started.

I find myself thinking and re-thinking about the end. I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know, it was hard for me to really get into the book and then to come to the end so abruptly.. I guess thats why Im not sure if I liked liked the book.",1521590400,3
8046,459,914,"I loved it!  This book is great at describing the early, close knit,  inexperienced, hardworking Van Halen who eventually becomes the fractured disparate Van Halen.  It is written by their Road Manager who immediately elevates to Group Manager and seems to do a great job.  Particularly with ventures like merchandise sales.  But recognize it is written from his eyes, both good and bad.  I found his story to be believable and also provide what appears to be honest input in to the strengths and weaknesses of the individual members.  Like Alex, who the manager's wife likes to spend time with on the road.  But who can also be vindictive.  Or David Lee Roth.  Talented, vain, aggressive who eventually works his way out of the band with his nightclub type rendition of ""California Girls"".

If anything this book was short on the sex and drugs stories.  Yes, there are some.  But generally not as much as I would have preferred.  Still, I enjoyed the book quite a lot.",1521590400,5
8047,816,544,"This is my fourth read of the Night Huntress series, and I couldn't believe that I haven't reviewed them on the blog before. Probably because once I get going on this series, I tend to binge the books one after another and get carried away before I manage to put pen to paper for a review. So why am I reading them again this time? Well I was recently recommending the series to a friend and it put the bug in my brain that I was missing me some Cat and Bones... and I just had to get back to my favorite English vampire and his fiery assassin.

Catherine Kathleen Crawfield (a/k/a Cat) is a half-breed vampire and human who has been raised to think that all vampires are evil demons that need killing. Cat's mother is a real piece of work who has relayed a tragic story to Cat to convince her of this ""fact"" and has encouraged Cat to go on the hunt since she was a teenager. Even though Cat is now in her early 20s, she is still a somewhat naive girl, which is at odds with her nocturnal activity. But throughout this story (and the series as a whole), Cat becomes a true kickass heroine. She remains one of my favorite romance heroines to this day.

But as much as I like Cat, I adore our hero that much more. Crispin ""Bones"" Russell is a 200+ year old vampire, originally from England, but ""made"" in New South Wales. He is funny, possessive, sexy and powerful. He is also one of my favorite romance heroes. Some of the one-liners and teasing that he doles out to our heroine is hilarious, and I just live to hear his ""Hallo, Kitten.""

This first book sees Cat and Bones teaming up, and Cat gets an education about vampires that she was sorely lacking. The romance between them unfolds slowly as the book progresses, and things don't get too steamy (yet). Halfway to the Grave really lays the foundation for the series and lets you establish that connection with both Cat and Bones, and start getting to know some of the secondary characters. We learn about vampires along with Cat and see her grow as a person, and start to accept her dual nature.

Even though this is my fourth time reading the book, it was just as good as the first time. I'm moving forward with a binge of the series so stay tuned for more reviews.",1521590400,4
8048,346,1945,"I got this book from my mom (they are moving and wanted to get rid of some books).  This was a surprisingly engaging novella/folk tale about two old women who are abandoned by their tribe during a particularly tough winter.

Both the tribe and the old women end up learning a lot about their limits and what is important to them as a result of this abandonment.  It was a quick read and a good story.  I found myself surprisingly sucked into the tale.  I enjoyed the survival elements and hearing about people of that time and how they survived in such harsh conditions.

The writing style is very stark and simple (normally not my favorite style of writing to read) but it matched the style of the tale well.

Overall a well done folktale that I enjoyed reading.  I would recommend if you are interested in tribal Alaska, survival, or the process of aging.",1521590400,4
8049,459,1946,"Exceptional!  As a businessman you would occasionally see Kerkorian on his next big purchase adventure.  But what this book does a fascinating job of is adding context by giving an in depth history of his early years of life followed by his early years as a pilot followed by his early investments.  That earlier context allows you to view his MGM, casino and auto company purchases in later years in an entirely different light.  Particularly his initial airplane investment and his early casino leveraged investments.

I also admit that as a fervent tennis player he interested me as in his 80s he still played some national events.  And while I don't live in CA, I had purchased Kreiss furniture, the California casual look that was the husband of his later controversial girlfriend, Lisa Bonder.  Lisa was a Top 20 tennis player who ""dated"" attempted to marry and inherit the fortune of Kerkorian.  I paraphrased and I'm sure not to her liking.  But basically, it is as it is.

His later life is also quite interesting as he was quite active up to the end.  I ran in to him at the mall just outside Century City.  Unknown to all except me.

8051,414,1943,"Im inevitably drawn to books about the wild, nature, wolves and the like. The Wild Inside by Jamey Bradbury spoke to me before I even knew what the book was about. It sounded like a mix of a few different genres, so I really didn't know what I was getting into.

The voice in this book takes a bit getting used to; at first it was a bit dominating and overwhelmed the rest of the story. But its also a vital component of the character and it does, somewhat, grow on you the further you read and the more you get to know Tracy.

I felt that calling this a thriller was a bit misleading. There were some secrets and some mysteries to uncover, but it wasn't in a thriller-type sense. To me, it felt a bit more supernatural than anything else, which isn't at all mentioned anywhere. This part could have been a much more interesting element, but its not explored to its full extent and I feel like the author was actively trying to avoid being too supernatural. This part is reoccurring through the entire book and ends up being pretty in your face towards the end, but theres no real context to it. It was a style chosen, not to give those details, but Im the kind of person who likes those details and if thats what you're going for, then wear that proudly and explore it to its depths, don't just touch upon the surface.

Its clear that Bradbury is writing about what she knows, dog racing and the cold, blank Alaskan backdrop. I, however, know nothing about dog racing nor do I really have much of an interest in it, which made parts of this book a struggle for me. I liked how this all set the scene, but it was a very dominant character for the first part of the book and I felt things dragging a little bit. I also want to mention that hunting and trapping is a large part of this story and the scenes are gratuitous, but they are somewhat descriptive, which won't be for every reader.

I did really enjoy the wolf/dog attributes that came out in Tracys feelings and descriptions of things. I liked how tied to the woods she was and how running made her feel liberated and free. Those sentiments always paint a nice picture for me and I enjoyed exploring those parts. I also really enjoyed the ending, when things finally came together and where Tracy ended up in the whole thing. I found it satisfying and it fit with the rest of the story.

However, overall, this book didn't really do it for me. It was well written, but I personally didn't care that much for the content or the characters and just as I started to become interested and be pulled into this mysterious supernatural attribute, that part would end and wed go back to dog racing. I guess Im not as akin to nature as I thought.

8052,459,1817,"A book by Nick Nolte, the current quack/horrid dresser, unshaven Malibu resident?  Yes and it's different that your perception and it's exceptional!  Not surprising that his early academic history is below average, nor that he was a frustrated college football player.  But rarely do you see athletes become so committed to the theater which he did moving to his start AZ.  Here is a brief interlude into his early marriages followed by his career in Hollywood.

I first saw him in the fascinating Rich Man, Poor Man.  The first real miniseries which was the epic TV story method preferred in the 70s.  His role as the swashbuckling Tom Jordache to the more sophisticated Rudy was a great starting role that he parlayed in to an exceptional career.  Who would have thought that his next movie known for a ""wet T-Shirt"" would propel him further in to fame.  I'm speaking of course of ""The Deep"".  And it's not his T-Shirt.

He does touch on his weirdness in later life after becoming People Magazines ""Sexiest Man Alive"".  This is an easy book to pass over.  But don't!  It's well worth the read.",1521590400,5
8053,711,1929,"How do you know where you're going when youve never seen your story told before? What are you running from, what are you running towards, and what parts of yourself do you leave behind when you take off? Uzodinma Iwealas slender novel, SPEAK NO EVIL, speaks volumes, and reverberates with hard truths about the intersections of race, gender, institutionalized violence and sexuality.

In contemporary D.C., two 18-year-olds navigate these intersections. Niru and Meredith have been best friends for a long time. On the surface, their lives overlap --- the success of their respective parents buys them certain class privileges and affords them the raised expectations of Ivy League-bound youths, full of promise. But when Meredith seeks to turn their friendship into something more, Nirus long-buried truth crashes to the surface. He is gay, which isn't a big deal to Meredith and her left-leaning East Coast white sensibilities, but is absolutely devastating to Nirus conservative Nigerian immigrant parents. Their discovery of his secret is inextricably entangled in his friendship with Meredith, and that fact haunts both teens for the rest of their lives.

Nirus parents bring him to Nigeria for conversion therapy. He finds some solace in his parents hometown, but also predominantly further isolation. How much easier it would be for him and his family if conversion therapy worked. But, of course, it doesnt. Niru wants to cut his sexuality away cleanly, to be the son his parents want, but he cant --- all the more so when he returns home and meets a handsome dancer named Damien.

This is not a straightforward novel or a happy one. Niru tells his own story for the first half of the book, which culminates in an act of violence, desperation and all-too-familiar misunderstanding. Meredith picks up the pieces and narrates the second half, looking back on it six years later. Iweala understands all too well how books are often split into singular issues --- race, class, gender, violence --- and weaves together many of these threads into a savagely realistic story.

I came away from SPEAK NO EVIL galvanized and outraged, but also devastated. Iweala was widely celebrated for his first book, BEASTS OF NO NATION. Expect a narrower focus here, but a no-less wrenching takeaway and consistently luminous prose. His deft writing propels the narrative forward. At times, I did want more --- I wanted more understanding of how Niru kept this truth from himself for so long, and what it felt to experience it, however briefly, with Damien. And yet, Iwealas voice kept me deeply invested in his project, and I do feel that the moments he left me yearning were carefully and brutally chosen, refusing to give me more than Niru was able to receive.

I love both Nirus and Merediths voices. I could feel her helplessness, desire and well-meaning. I could feel his agony, desperation, and need to run and to keep running. This is a prescient, urgent awakening of a read. Go in with an open heart, but prepare for it to shatter. Be ready to carry Niru and Meredith with you for a long time.

After reading Alice Feeneys psychological thriller SOMETIMES I LIE, I am now convinced there is another super sinister side somewhere at the edge of evil. Man, oh, man. This book will not let you down, thriller lovers. You will be on the edge of whatever perch you read.

The narrator is in a coma, but she can hear what is happening and what is going on is nothing short of terrifying. She is not sure what her responsibility is in how she got to the hospital and what harm she might have caused.

Set aside some serious time to read because once you start this, I promise you will not be able to put this book down. For sure you will be creeped out, but that creep factor is what will keep you wanting for more.

8059,711,1505,"I have to confess that I have gotten somewhat jaded with the unreliable narrator plot that seems to drive a great number of thrillers being published these days. They certainly continue to be popular, and God bless. There are enough books of wide variety out there that one can hardly feel deprived of new reading material, regardless of interest or preference. But a terrific book is a terrific book, and Alice Feeneys debut is an unreliable narrator tale that is one of those.

SOMETIMES I LIE moves from time to time to time, that being primarily (with a couple of exceptions near its conclusion) the books Now, Then and Before. Now is the 10 or so days from December 26th (Boxing Day, for our British friends) to January 3rd, while Then is the week prior. Both sections are narrated in the first person by Amber Reynolds, who in the Now is in a coma, nonresponsive but very much aware of what is going on around her. She has no idea how she got where she is. However, as conversations occur around and over her, what is said and what is not leads her to believe that either her husband Paul or her sister Claire --- or both --- might have had something to do with it.

It is the Then, though, that comprises the most intriguing sections. Amber is employed by a local radio station and is partnered with Madeline Frost, the stations Queen Bee. Frost has been the host of a top-rated morning radio program for two decades, and her helpful public persona is nothing like her private demeanor. Here, the reader gains some insight into the workings of Amber, and its obvious shes not quite right. This is reinforced in the Before sections (you thought I had forgotten about those, didn't you?), which consist of excerpts from a diary written some 24 years prior to the books Now and deal in part with Ambers childhood at age 10 and her friendship with a lonely girl who, for better and for worse, will have an influence on her that will transcend their school years.

Meanwhile, in the present, Ambers problems extend beyond her comatose state. Someone keeps visiting her hospital bedside and does not seem to mean her well. Amber has no idea who this person is, but he or she certainly knows her. The problem is that Amber cant do anything about it, given that she is trapped in her body. Youll be asking yourself throughout how Amber is going to get out of her situation --- even after you find out the truth --- but when you learn the answer and its full ramifications, youll want to reread the book just to witness how Feeney pulls things off.

Let me elaborate on the pulls things off statement. Feeney spends the first third or so of SOMETIMES I LIE setting up the dominoes, the middle third making you think there aren't any dominoes, and the final third throwing them all over the room. But there is a precise order to it, with a bit of justice and revenge thrown in for good measure, as well as a concluding sentence that surprises and chills. The result is a one-sit read that keeps you guessing and wondering, even after youve finished the book, from an author to watch in the future.

8060,1071,1505,"My opinion of SOMETIMES I LIE changed constantly. Honestly, it's a one or two star book for most of it that moves into the four-star area in plot only at the very end. I nearly stopped a few times, but I got it after a wait list, and I couldn't just get it back, so I plodded on. Yet another present-past-present-past formula. It's about a woman in a coma. Exciting! Also, do they not have catheters in the UK?

Once I got past the irritation of some incorrect medical possibilities, the silly format, play-by-play of every single moment of the coma, and multiple long slow sections of childhood diaries, there was a decent book hiding somewhere inside. Actually, I think there's a decent *movie* hiding inside. I don't know that this could be a great book without a whole new writer. It felt very much like a screenplay to me.

I did get to a point where I wanted to know what happened. We go a very long time with nothing happening. It's all foreshadowing. Then in the final fifth(?) of the book, about a thousand twists all just start coming one after the other. I knew a few things would happen. I'd also guessed one of the biggest in a way. I wasn't exactly correct, but I was not entirely off. I just had the reason for the ""reveal"" down to something slightly different than it was. Outcome was the same.

So this book felt to me like a screenplay for a rollercoaster that starts off going straight for about four painstaking miles, then in the last mile it not only has steep drops, but also loops and upside-down twirls and adds water and some poodles and there's a clown under your seat. It was a lot. It was overkill. It will be a fun movie though.",1521590400,3

8065,749,583,"Annihilation clawed its way onto my all-time favorites list when I read it back in January. I finally picked up a copy of Authority recently and made my way back into the world of the Southern Reach. A friend of mine had warned me that the sequel was entirely different, and she was right. Authority is more of a behind-the-scenes look at the goings on of the mysterious government agency in charge of the expeditions. While some questions are answered, far more are dredged up.

Jeff VanderMeer blew me away with his writing once again. From the narrative voice to the characters, I found myself drawn into the story and into Controls mind. I was as desperate to untangle the secrets as he was. While the middle lagged a bit as far as interest goes, the end of the book pulls the reader down under a wave of action and tension. After turning the last page, I found myself shaken and thirsting for the next book.

Authority is a fantastic sequel, although it doesnt hold up to Annihilation in my book, mainly due to the lulls that made it hard to push through the middle. VanderMeer continues the captivating and enigmatic story of Area X and the Southern Reach and leaves you wanting more. I can only hope that Acceptance leaves me with a satisfying ending.",1521590400,4

I was lucky enough to get this wonderful book in my Owlcrate subscription for March.

I loved this book so very much. I love space opera's and this one is awesome.

I love all of the characters from the space crew. Not so much anyone from the space station but Robb.

There are 4 POV's in the book: Ana, DO9, Robb and Jax. This doesn't make it confusing at all either. And of course I love these 4 main characters. I love them to bits.

Ana and DO9 are best friends but there are a few more feelings going on, well the android (DO9) can't feel or can he? Then Robb and Jax have this like/hate thing going on. Most everyone does with Robb at first because he's and Ironblood, he's royalty. But Robb is not like his family and he's trying to find his father and gets thrown in with Ana, DO9 and Jax who are on the same mission to a lost ship.

The whole crew and the new friends find out they all have to stick together to help save each other from Robb's evil mother and other things that are going on. Yes, there are some deaths but that is to be expected.

I'm just so happy that I loved this book as much as I did. I had a feeling I would from the summary. I would recommend to people that enjoy YA Sci-Fi type books.

Happy Reading!

8071,302,1943,"The Wild Inside by Jamey Bradbury is a so-so debut horror/rural noir novel set in Alaska.

Tracy Petrikoff, seventeen, has been raised hunting and trapping, as well as caring for the family's sled dogs, in Alaska. She runs wild in the wilderness and gets her strength from it. It has been nearly two years since her mother's death, and her father, Bill, is still recovering from her death. Now she has been expelled from school, her father is trying to load her up with chores and limit her time trapping and running through the woods. Tracy wants to enter her first adult Iditarod, but her father isn't listening to her. He was a champion musher, but has essentially retired now.

When Tracy goes out to check her traps, a stranger attacks her and knocks her unconscious. She comes to with her bloody knife lying nearby. The next day a man emerges from the woods onto their property with a deadly knife wound. Did Tracy inflict the wound with the hunting knife she always carries? She can't remember, but he seems to be familiar. Tracy keeps all her thoughts to herself and doesn't tell her father what happened.

Positives about the novel were the beautiful descriptions of Alaska. This book evoked a rollercoaster of emotions for me, however many of them were not positive. There is one thing Tracy does, aside from her horrible grammar, which made the book almost a ""did not finish,"" something I don't do lightly. Tracy's bad grammar will grate on many readers nerves after a while in this first-person narrator; it's just a fact. Tracy is feral in many ways. The one activity that Tracy does, which I won't describe, is disturbing. There is a description/revelation of it that happens early in the book, which really cemented my averse reaction to Tracy as a character. Sometimes something is simply too weird for some readers. Take note that there is no mention of any supernatural elements in the description, which would have steered me away from this book.

However, the trip turned into a nightmare and many years later Lou is still having problems because of everything Mike has done to her. She's in her early thirties and is alone because she has relationship issues. When she inherits her father's house and goes back to the area she met Mike, she decides to confront her past. To her disgust she discovers that Mike is grooming another girl. Chloe is thirteen years old and Lou will do everything she can to make sure history won't repeat itself. Unfortunately it isn't easy to get people to listen, how far will Lou be willing to go to make sure Chloe remains safe? Mike is a predator, will she risk her own wellbeing and take the chance she'll be his victim once again?

Wendy is trying to approach Lou, but how can she do that without raising suspicion? She has to be careful if she wants to reach her goal. Because of Lou her whole life changed and there's a lot she holds Lou accountable for. Is this justified? What is the connection between the two women and will meeting Lou give Wendy the answers she needs?

The Fear is a gripping story about a despicable dangerous man and his victims. Mike skillfully grooms teenage girls with problems at home. Lou and Chloe's parents have other things on their minds than the happiness of their children and he uses this to his advantage. I felt sick when I read about his personality, his actions and the methods he uses. C.L. Taylor describes him in a fantastic believable way that makes him come to life almost too well. Mike is clever and cunning, a man to fear. Not knowing what his next move would be kept me on the edge of my seat.

Lou used to be a vulnerable teenager. She's still fragile now that she's older, having plenty of scars from everything that happened between her and Mike. She was too scared to testify and was always afraid he'd come after her. C.L. Taylor writes about her fear in an amazing way, I could really feel it. I could easily imagine why she wanted to save Chloe from a fate similar to her own. Chloe is young and naive. She's being bullied and doesn't have any self confidence. Love is lacking in her life and Mike is more than willing to fill that gap. I couldn't stop reading as I was anxious to find out if Chloe would see his true nature in time. I was also curious to see what Wendy's role would be in the story. She's a complex woman with a personality that has many different layers. I loved how C.L. Taylor alternates between the three equally interesting characters.

C.L. Taylor has written another thought-provoking book. She's an expert when it comes to dividing tension. Her books always surprise me in many different ways. The Fear has plenty of unexpected twists and turns and the ending is absolutely mindblowing. The subject matter of The Fear is disturbing and reading about Mike put tears in my eyes plenty of times.

8076,15,1948,"This is my go-to genre but recently I have been a bit disappointed with the books I have read. So much so that I was toying with the idea of taking a break from them for a while. But, having read and enjoyed all this author's previous books, I though I'd sneak just one more in before I took my break. Boy am I glad I did! This book epitomised everything I want, need and love about a good psychological thriller. Grabbing me from the start, holding on to my attention throughout, and leaving me satisfied at the end.
Set in the present day, with flashback to the past, we follow Lou as she returns to her childhood home to sort out her late father's house. This move back reminds her of a time in her life when she was very unhappy and turned to the affections of one of her teachers. This ""relationship"" culminating in the two of them running away abroad. Her teacher, Mike, is now out of prison and still living in the town and Lou is shocked to say the least when she sees him with a young girl. Knowing what she herself went through, she knows that she much stop this relationship before things get worse. But will anyone believe her? What will it take for her to protect the child and bring the predator to justice once and for all?
I absolutely loved the direction this book took. Unlike a lot of this genre of book, I decided early on that I had no idea where we were going so I just allowed the author to take me on her characters' journeys. I gave up trying to second guess and just went with the flow and I think I had a much better reading experience doing this. And boy was it a thrilling ride!
Characters and indeed character development through the book was absolutely brilliant. I loved the way that several of the characters came of age through the book. I am not just talking about the young characters here either. Even some of the more mature characters have moments of clarity and awakenings throughout the book. The book is told from multiple points of view throughout and we get to see some of these things pretty much first hand. I am not over keen on this method of storytelling as a general rule but, when it is done as well as it has been here, it just makes for a really great read as it fits the plot and its development absolutely perfectly.
Lou's backstory is told in flashback with the salient parts drip fed in exactly the right moments to complement the story as it unfolds in the present. There are certain things that maybe don't quite gel in the present and have to be held into until the appropriate past explanation but this just added to the level of intrigue that the book held me in throughout.
There's also a lot of shocking and rather questionable ""means to an end "" action contained within the book but, to be honest, they are pretty much all justified and had me questioning my own morals a bit throughout. Some of the things that happen to certain characters along the way do seem a little dubious but, when you get to the final chapter, which I loved by the way, you do get the feeling that sometimes it's the only way.
Pacing was absolutely perfect and, despite the underlying theme of child grooming, there were the odd lighter moments that made the book remain balanced. I personally don't like it when a book is too dark but here, the author stays the right side of things throughout. She also treats the subject matter with great respect and has obviously done her research. Yes, there is a lot of really nasty stuff contained within the pages but all included for story telling and plot development rather than shock tactic.
All in all, another really great addition to an already really impressive back catalogue. I really can;t wait to see what the author has in store next time. My thanks go to the Publisher and Netgalley for the chance to read this book.",1521676800,5

I loved the twists in this novel. When I first started this novel, I was questioning whether this book was for me as it seemed jumpy but things soon settled down.  I had many questions as I read this novel, it was one of those novels that pushed me the more that I read.  Individuals were trying to be devious and cunning and they were doing an excellent job of it yet I began to wonder who exactly is doing the scheming?

Polly had a history. She has just walked out on her husband and her three-year-old daughter, history seems to be repeating itself.  How Polly can leave her children behind baffles me and I needed to learn more about Polly to understand her motives.  Polly arrives in a small town and she begins to build a life there yet I have a feeling, she won't be staying long.  Adam, pops up on the scene and Polly notices him but after what she just did to husband #2, she notices him but there isn't that instant romance a guy like him would provoke. Adam knows about Pollys past and has followed her to this town, in his truck.

Now that we got individuals where they belong and we got some history, I couldn't put the book down as things inside this novel started to get interesting.  I liked how Polly got comfortable in her new surroundings.  The small town welcomed her, Adam seemed to be making his own life in this town too and Polly found a job at the High-Ho Bar which led to some exciting adventures.  I learned about her past and although I didn't want to cast Polly in a negative light, her past was awful dark.  The ending really surprised me and I really enjoyed it.  I highly recommend this novel, it began with a slow burn and then grabs you in.",1521676800,5

The writing is simple and inelegant, probably due to loss in translation. But there is plenty to be learned and remembered from this memoir. One hundred pages of sheer terror. I simply cannot imagine. The only thing that troubles me is how our narrator constantly blames the world for being silent while babies are burned. That's not true! The world was in a war!

8084,457,1901,"My queen, Gillian Flynn, starts this book with a Midwestern twang and down-to-earth introduction; Patton Oswalt ends with a heart-rending final chapter and I was spellbound the entire time by Michelle McNamara's non-fiction novel.

A mind-blowing mountain of evidence to sift through and present in one novel only slightly frightened Michelle McNamara. What truly frightened her and kept her awake at night was the fact that the Golden State Killer has gotten away with his 10 year reign of terror and is possibly blending into society as someone's husband or dad now.

Yes, McNamara was obsessed with her search for the monster. If you read even a small item about this killer/rapist, I doubt you can remain content to leave it at that. It is impossibly frustrating in this day of DNA instant matching that the creep could still be walking the streets. She rightfully felt until the day she died that she was on the verge of identifying the killer, probably through an Ancestry.com like site.

A true-crime blogger, McNamara knew she was obsessed with GSK and does not hold back the introspective criticism. She knows herself and she understands people on a level that most of us don't. The seasoned and weary criminalists on the case came to appreciate, even rely on her skills. She, in turn, relied heavily on crowd-sourcing and advanced technology to help in the relentless search.

She writes impressively about the victims, the survivors and the detectives involved. She articulates the many (50) cases in bite-sized chunks and does not glorify nor hold back the details. It is a terrifying book, yet full of compassion and understanding for the victims.

My mouth continually fell open and my head was shaking NO as I listened to this moving account from one woman with an enormous investigation to relate to the public. It is simply a magnificent piece of work. The audio narration is AMAZING, but I still ended up buying the Kindle version to look at the maps and other evidence she has pictured.",1521763200,5
8085,496,1901,"My Thoughts: Ill Be Gone in the Dark is really two stories. The first, a gruesome tale of dozens of rapes and multiple murders over a span of ten years, and the man who committed them. The second, a womans near obsessive desire to find that man and unmask The Golden State Killer. The fact that these two fascinating narratives are so tightly woven together makes for unforgettable reading and a whole new take on true crime writing. Listening to the details of this mans crimes left me a little haunted and also with a creepy feeling of being a voyeur witnessing others suffering. I didn't want to know, but I couldn't stop listening. Equally captivating were McNamara and the many others investigating crimes more than twenty-five years after theyd occurred. In that time span DNA testing had grown much more refined and internet advances could now helped anyone visit crime scenes from the comfort of their own homes, giving hope to finally identifying the killer. Working with police detectives, cold crime investigators, and the FBI, McNamara followed the trail of this cold-blooded killer only to reach dead-ends time after time. Sadly, McNamara died in her sleep before she could complete this book. The remainder was pieced together from her many notes, articles, and blog posts. For Michelle, the many victims, their families and the tireless law enforcement investigators I hope someday The Golden State Killer will be found. Grade: B

Audio/Narration: Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating a difficult book. The story had many different people in it and lots of conversations. She made those easy to follow and delivered the story with ease. I will say that given the choice, Id recommend reading Ill Be Gone in the Dark over listening to it. There was quite a bit of jumping around in time and location and many different investigators involved. Had I been reading the book, Id more easily have had the ability to look back and clarify confusion that arose from time to time. Included with the audiobook was a PDF attachment with maps and a list of law enforcement officers. This was useful, but not always convenient.",1521763200,4

*****

'The Mysterious Affair at Styles' is Agatha Christie's first published book, and it's less sophisticated than her later work. The story does, however, introduce three well-known Christie characters: Hercule Poirot, Captain Hastings, and Inspector Japp.

As the book opens Hastings has been injured in WWI and is recuperating at Styles Court, a manor house in the country. Styles Court belongs to the Cavendish family, and is currently occupied by a diverse assemblage of people, including: Emily Inglethorpe - the widow of the late Mr. Cavendish - who inherited a lifetime interest in the house AND a large sum of money; Emily's new - much younger - husband, Alfred Inglethorpe; Emily's adult stepson, John Cavendish; John's wife Mary; John's bachelor brother Lawrence; Evelyn Howard - Emily's longtime friend and companion; Cynthia Murdoch - the orphaned daughter of family friends; and Dorcas, the maid.

There's a tense atmosphere at Styles because of simmering resentments and secrets. For example:
John Cavendish - who'll inherit the manor house when his stepmother dies - thinks it should have been his all along; in addition, John is suspected of dallying with the pretty wife of a neighboring farmer.
John's wife Mary, in turn, spends a lot of time with Dr. Bauerstein - the local toxicologist who hails from Germany. To add to this 'quadrangle', Captain Hastings has a crush on beautiful Mary.
Evelyn Howard hates Alfred Inglethorpe, convinced he only married Emily for her money.
Alfred Inglethorpe's thick beard looks like a disguise, and he has long poorly explained absences.
Lawrence Cavendish resents Cynthia Murdoch, who's very aware of her status as an 'outsider'; Cynthia supports herself with a job in a pharmacy.....and she seems to be the only one of this bunch who has a job.

As it happens, a group of Belgian refugees, including Hercule Poirot, are living in a house near Styles Court - an arrangement facilitated by Emily Inglethorpe. Hastings is thrilled to see Poirot and lauds the former policeman's detective skills - so it's clear they've met before.

In the midst of the testy atmosphere at Styles Court Emily Inglethorpe dies from strychnine poisoning - in a locked room. Hastings suspects foul play and prevails on Poirot to investigate, and the Belgian complies.....with Hastings as his partner. To round out the 'detective trio', Inspector Japp is assigned to the case.

During the investigation Poirot learns that Emily had a loud fight with an unknown male on the day before she died; Emily's latest will is missing; there have been shenanigans with Emily's locked document box; someone bought strychnine at the town's pharmacy; coffee and cocoa were consumed on the evening of the murder....and a cup has been smashed; there's something suspicious about Emily's medicine packets; etc.

As often happens in these stories, Poirot makes shrewd deductions about everything.....but doesn't share them; Hastings tries to demonstrate his investigative skills but misinterprets most of the clues; and Japp hares off after the wrong suspect(s).

The book is chock full of misdirection and red herrings, but - in the end - Poirot gathers the suspects and reveals the truth.

The book is just so-so. Though Christie's nascent writing skills are apparent, the plot is overly convoluted (to the point of unbelievability); Poirot talks too much (yak yak yak); and there's a whiff of anti-Semitism and classism (though this is common in Christie's books......a sign of her times.)

If you're a long time Agatha Christie fan, this book would make a fun re-read; and if you're new to the famous author's works, this is a good place to start.",1521763200,3

8092,86,269,"I  was surprised at how much different the book is from the story told in the movie. A good story, told in the style of Dracula using letters and narration to tell the story. Still it was an entertaining story. Hard to believe it was written by a nineteen year old",1521763200,4

I appreciated how Erdrich sets the context that the world is devolving but doesn't feel compelled to explain why or what exactly is happening. The story is all about the characters -- really how the main character thinks about what's happening and gets through it. The lyrical style of writing made the book more emotional.",1521763200,3
8094,369,1499,"This was one of those few times that I've watched the movie before reading the book. Like most books to movies, the two are almost completely different. Sometimes that works, most of the times it doesn't. Count this as the third time for me that I thought a movie was equal/better to the book.

Numbering the differences would take WAY too long. I would say if you've only experienced one or the other, go into the book/movie with an open mind.

What I liked about this (my favorite part) was the storytelling voice. Instantly I was like, ""pass the chips! This is a fairy tale!"" I love that fairy tale voice and Gaiman did an excellent job of writing a story that flowed so beautifully in that way.

I loved the descriptions, the flow of the story, the dialogue, etc. There were a few times with the plot where I felt like things could've been elaborated on more: The weird furry man that helps out Tristran. We never see or hear from him again after their separation. How was having a one night stand with a fantasy person Dunstan's heart's desire? Why did Tristran not question what was happening or his origins once his father started helping him leave Wall and he became an exception to crossing the Wall after a cryptic speech?

I thought it was supremely sad that Tristran's family never got to see him again. He stopped by once and we don't get to see that goodbye or get an explanation as to why they couldn't visit each other or why his family couldn't/wouldn't join him.

As far as characters go, most of the development is in Tristran and Yvaine. The rest are left with the barest smudges of characterization. This wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that our main two were rather lacking. The characters by far were the weakest point. The villains didn't seem all that scary and in the end the main one [ just gave up her fight. No final showdown or nothing. She and Yvaine part on relatively good terms. It was weird. (hide spoiler)]

Tristran is dull--in more than one way. He's incredibly single-minded and simple. He lacks a strong moral character or really any strong personality traits at all. He falls for the most obvious person in the village, boasts silly things to try and make himself look good, ends up chasing a star--let's face it, the chances of finding a fallen rock that land months distance away is uh, yeah--and then he doesn't even bat an eye over the star being not a rock! Yvaine is a bit dehumnaized by constantly being referred to as the star. But also by the fact that Tristran never once ponders over the morality of dragging a woman away as a present for another woman. Hello!

And she's injured! He doesn't care! He's got tunnel vision on this True Love thing and he's going to kidnap a person and drag them on a 6 month journey without caring for their injuries all to gift them to Victoria. And he never really says he's sorry for that and for months still plans on giving Yvaine to Victoria. I mean, does he expect Victoria to believe this person is a star? What if she decides to keep treating Yvaine as an object since Tristran did and keep her as a pet or something?

In general Tristran shows poor judgement and little remorse. This made him an unlikable character that I couldn't cheer for or bond with in any way.

That left Yvaine to carry the story and though she has lots of great lines and her personality was great, she didn't have ENOUGH of a presence in the story to be the one character carrying it.

I also don't think Tristran deserved the ending he got. He gets HEA even after just being a jerk and only changing his focus once the one path is no longer an option.

Lastly I thought it was kind of a crap move to not return with his mother and not even tell her a time he'd be back. Left her running his kingdom(he didn't even give it to her!) for him while he got to have his fun. Three years with no word from him. And then he's thinking about going home and you know what, nah. He takes 5 more years. Loser. Must be nice to spend your entire life doing whatever you want with no concern for your actions and have it all turn out right. Doesn't matter what choices he made, it all worked out for him. He was free to be a dick and have zero consequences.

That was definitely an area the movie got right. Tristran developed and grew and changed. He matured and became a better person. But yeah, the way he was written was easily my least favorite thing about this book.",1521763200,4
8095,1090,16,"Daddy claims the Hogwarts houses are really gangs. They have their own colors, their own hideouts, and they are always riding for each other, like gangs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione never snitch on one another, just like gangbangers. Death Eaters even have matching tattoos. And look at Voldemort. Theyre scared to say his name. Really, that He Who Must Not Be Named stuff is like giving him a street name. Thats some gangbanging (a no-no word)* right there.

Impactful. I think this one word encompasses my feelings about the entire book. Angie Thomas has created characters that I will think about for a long, long time.

I'm not going to pretend like I know or understand what Starr went through. There's no way for me to know, because I haven't lived that. I haven't experienced that prejudice and hatred. It was eye-opening to read a book from Starr's perspective. She sees the world so differently, and she's forced to live by a separate set of rules based on the color of her skin.

My parents raised me to see color when I looked at another person. Once I was old enough to make decisions for myself, we started to clash on a lot of things, but race seemed to be a big one. I wasn't allowed to play with other kids at school if they didn't look like me, and as a kid that's so (a no-no word)* confusing. My parents actually instructed my teachers to inform them if they saw me interacting with classmates that ""looked different,"" which my teachers obediently did.

If I asked my parents to read this book, I doubt they would. It makes me sad. They're filled with so much hatred and they don't even know why. It's just ""the way things are,"" and that's not okay. It's a (a no-no word)* excuse to exercise hate.

The Hate U Give shows how an entire community, a family, and a girl live in a world full of that hate and indifference. They have different rules to get them through the day, especially if they're pulled over by a police officer. It shouldn't be that way. It's wrong. I don't know why so many people still cannot grasp that concept.

Starr is a strong, brilliant, lovely character. I enjoyed watching her live her life. Yes, she struggled, but she also grew as a person. She fought with friends, learned to understand community, found comfort in her family, and tried to get by in life. No one should have to eat dinner with gunfire going off in the background, or look out their window to see tanks driving down the road.

I think this book needs to be read by everyone (the narrator was wonderful if you enjoy audiobooks). I could talk about the incredible family dynamics (loved Starr's family!), the amazing secondary characters, or the significance of the protests and riots. There is so much being said in this book, and I have too many feelings to adequately express them all.

Angie Thomas is an amazing author that wrote something powerful and beautiful. It's a story that will have a lasting impact on this world, and I hope a lot of people take Starr's story to heart and try to be more understanding and uplifting.

Other quotes I liked:

Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.

At an early age I learned that people make mistakes, and you have to decide if their mistakes are bigger than your love for them.

Trust me, my school has hoes too. Hoedom is universal.

The briefest possible summary: a transoceanic flight loaded with young British schoolboys crashes near an uninhabited island. The surviving boys (no adults) struggle to create and maintain a primitive civitas. They fail. Their attempt at the simplest kind of self-government is wrecked by a cohort of boys who are persuaded by the charismatic, sociopathic Jack to indulge their inclinations to hedonism and barbarism. Ralphs idealistic efforts to establish order are fruitless. Jacks hunters end up killing two of their fellows before the grown-ups arrive to rescue them.
Goldings Lord of the Flies leads any defender of the common good to despair of civilized behavior that benefits all.

p.s. there are painfully disturbing similarities between Lord of the Flies and Shantung Compound: The Story of Men and Women Under Pressure (give this one a try, too).

8103,1030,1924,"Hmmm, how to start... its been a while since Ive read the other books, so I could probably use a refresher but Ill try my best with this.

What I didn't like:  This book felt too short, like there was so much that could have been done with it but the author didn't have time to because she was too busy focusing on the drama between Warner and Juliette. The old characters in the story were barely here, aside from Kenji and Castle. I wanted more on Warner and Adam and James, but they had barely any interaction in this story. Warner and Adam talked briefly for one chapter and thats it. Adam barely makes an appearance otherwise. I wanted to see them try to grow a relationship and interact, but that didn't happen. The bit of strength Juliette gained at the end of the last book seems to have gone here. She is completely unprepared for the job shes taken on - embarrassingly floundering in many aspects of it - and reverts back to being uncertain and scared and her sanity seems to worsen. She begins doubting Warner and everything that grew between them. And when she finds things out about his past she flips her lid. Her compassion for him has almost vanished, despite his attempts to make her happy. For as much abuse as she knows he has suffered, expecting him to spill his guts to her about his past all at once is unrealistic. Castles character because less admirable after we discover he knew certain things (no spoilers) and did nothing about them. Just apparently lived with the knowledge and did nothing to try correcting it. The plot twist were thrown here really didn't surprise me all that much. There are 2 sex scenes in here which required skipping a few pages. A few things about Warner/done by him seemed a bitttttt out of character for him but I won't say what because of spoilers. Clich Russian girl who is vicious and blonde and pale skinned. Brief appearance of apparent trans-in-progress character, that is mocked by said Russian.

What I did like: Getting every other chapter from Warners POV was awesome, and his and Kenjis interaction was hysterical.

8104,601,1942,"The story behind the story is that Amy Tan was inspired to write The Valley of Amazement after finding some photographs that indicated her grandmother had been one of the high class courtesans of Shanghai in years before World War I. Perhaps the fact that she was speculating about her grandmother caused the author to be too circumspect. I cannot recommend The Valley of Amazement to Ms Tans many admirers or to those looking for their first read.

As a fan I had been looking forward to this novel. Ms Tan is at her best telling tales of mother and daughters clashing and learning as history and generations and cultures bring them into conflict and reconciliation. The Valley of Amazement promised to include all of her strengths and give her an excuse to be naughty.

Instead she does not commit to her story. The sex, is not sexy. Dangers are almost never dangerous. All of her female characters have too many excuses and her males range from scoundrels to very good; only one is worse than merely unpleasant. The result is a complex interweaving of bland people experiencing an exotic if bland life.

For most of the book the protagonist is Violet. The child of an American mother and owner of the highest, high class house of courtesans of Shanghai just 1900. Courtesans not prostitutes. These women are sex workers, but their Johns, must court them and pay dearly for the fantasy that the men have seduced their way into the bed of their favorites.

Violet grows up a spoiled, self-center brat and by about page 20 we know she is not going to have a life only as a protected, observer of life among the flowers (Working women).

In a few pages her otherwise astute mother is tricked by one of her least reliable gentlemen. Violet is kidnapped and sold into sexual bondage. In about 1 paragraph, the spoiled child accepts her new role and excels at it. Her virginity is sold to a man who is exactly the man she hopes would have the best bid and so she become an active sex worker on something like her terms.

And so for hundreds of pages life goes on. Mostly to no particular purpose except to say that Violet lives a comparatively reasonable life. Yeah she has to have sex with men, but the pay is good and the conditions better. There are references to the horrible conditions of less popular sex workers and that life in China could be worse than miserable, but rarely does any of that touch our Violet.

If you manage to stay awake long enough to reach the last 150 or so pagers we share Violets one adventure into a non-protected world, but it does not last long and then we get to hear about life through her mothers eyes. Surprise, mom also has a back story.

I almost came to like the last 100 pages. The quality of the writing seemed to get better. Except, Ms Tan seemed to be marking time, letting years pass to no particular purpose except to allow her to come up with reasons why characters can delay decisions and opt for needlessly complex maneuvers.

My impression was that Ms Tan wanted to imagine what life could have been like for her grandmother. But if this Violet is supposed to be a relation, then it would not be polite to have this person suffer real suffering. Her humiliations must be passed over quickly and of course her sex life must be handled delicately. Nothing is ever truly bad, or good and I had very little sense of being in a world remote and unknown. Most of Violets world is limited to well decorated and managed rooms. The sex is present to the degree as to make the book a poor choice for the young or the bedroom adverse, but never erotic. It is regarded as a mostly mechanical process for the labor force, but never even as tedious as factory work. Violet has several opportunities to get out of The Life but is content to let events coast. She invents reasons why she cannot accept advantageous offers. This hardly makes her a strong woman in charge of her life. Her response to being a victim is as passive as her response to good fortune. Violent is not much more than a survivor with very little independence or strength to inspire our admiration.",1521849600,2
8105,37,1324,"I love this.

Nimona is this unapologetic, excited girl with totally unexplained superpowers.  She's a shapeshifter, or a skin changer, or... well honestly who cares because Sir Blackheart's evil career needs some serious boosting and HERE COMES NIMONA.

This graphic novel is a really well thought-out story about a girl who is lost, two old friends forced by the Institution to be enemies, and a system in power too busy entertaining its own ideas to worry about its people.  There's deep sentiment and delightful silliness in the panels.  I really enjoyed it.

As a graphic novel, it's brief.  The characters and world aren't really as well developed as in a novel.  That said, for the little slice of life you get to see them, they're delightful. I certainly wish there were additional volumes, but Nimona is based on a webcomic.  I love the characters' fears and struggles, and enjoyed trying to spot Nimona in various panels.

Many of the best scenes were ""filler"" - moments where Nimona is complaining about sardines in pizza or hiding in Blackhart's cape from a scary movie.

This was a great little book and a wholly recommend it.  I don't typically pick up graphic novels, and this one is fantastic.",1521849600,5
8106,650,1893,"You know you're 100% not into the book anymore when the book ends on a huge cliffhanger and you're like, well, eh, where was my green glowing Rasputin that never showed up?

This was one of my mostttttttttttttt anticipated books of 2018. It was one of my new favorite authors last year who created the masterpiece that was Geekerella that blended the Cinderella story with nerdy epicness and cons. When I heart Poston was taking on one of my favorite animated movies everrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Anastasia - in SPACE? MEETING FIREFLY? I was already crying.

Let me get out the retelling aspects out right now since literally all of my Goodreads updates were me trying to figure out where Rasputin was and who he was supposed to be. I guess I was expecting more Anastasia? Geekerella last year was full of cool, inventive takes on the original fairytale, and I guess I was expecting the same thing from this one. I was going into this story with it expecting it to be a retelling but with more of a Cinder feel to it? You're still having the things that happened in it but you still have more into the story with wars from evil peeps involved.

However, I think you should know this is not a full blown retelling. It's more like loosely based on. I don't know if was only ever supposed to be inspired by it, but I walked into this thinking it was going to be a retelling, and I was quite disappointed. I mean, yes, it does follow the whole overreaching plot of the whole lost princess thing, but it kind of took away a lot of the original plot of trying to convince the Grand Duchess of Ana's royalty and training her how to be a princess and such. I mean, Dmitri wasn't even the person to tell everyone that Ana was the person. I just felt a little jipped since it only took a few little things of the original story and put a whole new story in there. I JUST WANTED MY ANASTASIA STORY THAT I KNEW AND LOVED. I COULDN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHO WAS RASPUTIN. Since Anastasia is one of my ultimate loves (even though the poor gal isn't a Disney princess), I just felt a little misled by a few things walking into the story - probably from my own misguided expectations since the moment I saw Anastasia's name - and just wanted more.

OKAY, RANT DONE.

I do think Poston came up with such an inventive idea. I mean, she did take the main aspect of the Anastasia retelling and came up with a cool world. I liked the feel she created with this novel. I did sometimes struggle with the world building - it took me a ridiculously LONG time to figure out the HIVE thing - and I didn't even really understand if these people were on planets or how they were getting around or stuff like that. However, I think Poston did come up with cool, new things to the genre of sci-fi like the Solani and their powers. I liked the idea of The Great Dark as well, and the Iron stuff was pretty cool. But I was confused about a good deal of the world for a long time.

Poston still is a fantastic writer. She has such an ease with her writing. I mean, despite this being a 400+ page book, I sped through it in 3 days, since the flow and writing was just so easy to read. As I mentioned, there was a cool vibe to it, and the atmosphere she created was quite brilliant. I felt like I was in space, and even though it's hard for me to get into sci-fi, I felt invested in the novel because I liked the feel.

The characters were quite iffy. I mean, I didn't hate anyone, but I really didn't like anyone. We have four main characters/narrators, and I didn't feel anything for anyone. I suppose I liked Robb the best? I kept asking why everyone was hating on him, so I mean, I guess I felt the most for him. There were times that I did root someone on or felt bad for someone, but the most part, I felt nothing for them. Any feeling I had just felt surface level and didn't have any depth. I'm not entirely sure why I felt this way, but sometimes, I just felt like they were just a bit too...cliched? They didn't have little quirks that made them unique in my eyes. Jax felt like the cliche cocky, smartass captain while Ana felt like she was supposed to be the sassy, fierce special girl and Robb just felt like the conflicted hero. Di had a bit of a complexity to him that did feel different.

The romance was okay. I did prefer Jax's and Robb's romance to Ana's and Di's, but the Jax/Robb romance was totalllllllllll instalove. That took away some of the feels, but I did have some good feels for it. Ana and Di's ship was okay. Wasn't super into it, but I didn't hate it.

I definitely preferred the first part of the story's plot to the second part's. I thought it was super interesting when they were on the ship and working up to the middle part. Once the second part hit, I kind of didn't feel it as much as I was in the middle part. By the end, the action and pacing really ramped up, but I was kind of checked out by then. I think Poston did do good with creating tension and interesting twists and turns to pop up. However, I think the indifference I had for all of the characters really kind of made me not care what was happening and I didn't get the gravity of the situation. Something really intense happens at the end of the story and while it was something similar that happened in another book I read that I absolutely loved the characters (in which I was literally cringing/crying/all shocked faced), I barely blinked in this one.

Overall, this really wasn't the book I was expecting it to be. Poston is a very talented writer who did take another fairytale-esque story and make an interesting retelling. While it didn't have all of the aspects that I was looking for in it, she did create a unique world full of cool sci-fi vibes and good, easy writing with a nice flow and pacing. The romance wasn't bad, but I didn't feel anything for the characters. This book is a light read, and I think for those that are iffy with sci-fi, it would be a good book to read. However, it did have quite a few issues for me in just trying to get me to feel something for it. Two crowns and a Cinderella rating!",1521849600,2
8107,712,857,"I admit it, I picked up this book because, as a librarian myself, books about librarians and bookstore owners/employees strike a chord with me.  And a book about a librarian-turned-bookstore-owner seemed right up my alley, especially given that it took place in a small town and promised some interesting encounters with said town's locales.  I went into this book expecting not much else beyond some cute fluff... and ended up getting about what I was promised.  And while not the greatest read ever, ""The Bookshop on the Corner"" (a.k.a. ""The Little Shop of Happy-Ever-After,"" its UK title) is a perfectly cozy read, sweet and light and with a cast of delightfully colorful characters.

Nina is a quiet and painfully shy librarian who nonetheless has a knack for matching potential readers up with the perfect book... and so it comes as a painful blow when the library is closed down, leaving her adrift.  Rather than apply at the new media center replacing her beloved library, though, she decides to leap out on a whim for once in her life... and purchases a van, fills it with books, and sets off for a tiny Scottish town to run her own mobile book shop.  Setting off to match up the perfect book for as many villagers as she can, she finds herself caught up in their lives -- her grumpy landlord in the throes of a turbulent divorce, a book-loving girl hiding secrets about her home life, and a sweet Eastern-European train engineer who leaves her poetry and trinkets in the branches of a tree near the train tracks.  And as Nina finds her place in rural-small-town Scotland, she ends up feeling like she's come home... and perhaps finds love in the process.

Colgan's writing can be a little too sweet and saccharine at times, and at times it feels like she's trying to hard to be witty.  But for the most part I enjoyed her writing style -- pleasant, just descriptive enough to give us a clear and lovely picture of her setting, and with a keen insight into the lives of her characters.  She gives us a colorful cast of characters, and I found myself enjoying them... and appreciating that Colgan gave them real flaws and backstories, opting for something a little more complex than your standard ""eccentric townsfolk.""  I did get somewhat tired of the bog-standard love triangle that reared its head throughout the story, and felt that the romantic subplot was rather cliche (please tell me I'm not the only one sick and tired of the old ""they start out hating each other so of course they'll fall in love later"" trope), but it wasn't enough to make me quit reading.

I'm also rather disappointed that Colgan describes some fantastic-sounding books that Nina recommends to people... but when I went to research said books, many of them turned out to be completely fictional.  And here I wanted to read ""Up On the Rooftops"" for myself and see what was so charming about it.  Maybe Colgan will get inspired to ""de-fictionalize"" some of these titles and write them herself?  I can hope so...  The book also comes with an introduction detailing Colgan's reading habits, which I personally wasn't interested in and can be skipped without detracting from the story.

Not an earth-shattering read by any means, but a light and cozy read that's perfect for taking along on a trip or curling up with on a rainy day.  If you're a book lover and like books about fellow book lovers, you'll probably enjoy ""The Bookshop on the Corner.""",1521849600,3

8109,1071,1379,"I think I would like to be friends with Gabrielle Union, though I doubt she has the time. I'll be honest, as not too much of a social media or celebrity person, I wasn't entirely sure who she even was, but then I realized I'd seen her speeches on YouTube, and I had always liked what she had to say. So clearly I was in.

Gabrielle Union is a smart lady. She's clear on things like being a stepmom, rape, being black in the USA, being a woman, trying to get pregnant, not having children of her own...

When Union is passionate, she writes extremely well. When she is dwelling on gossip, it lost the luster for me. I honestly don't care much about how hard it is to be in the public spotlight or how Hollywood doesn't treat older women well. Know what? The whole world doesn't treat older women well. Somehow I can't feel sorry for these celebs.

But when she writes from the heart: about the difficulty in coming to terms with aging or the trauma of assault and rape or any number of other topics, she soars.

As such, this is one of the most uneven books I can still recommend. Come for the laughs, stay for the depth.",1521936000,4

8114,304,335,"This was EXCELLENT. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is one of my feminist heroes (I have a long list, with biographies I should read!) and this book is great. It's VERY easy to read, and was never less than fascinating. It includes some of her dissents, with commentary for the layperson written by various lawyers. There are photos of her at various points in her life; her face now is so familiar that seeing pictures of her as a young lawyer was really neat.

The only thing I didn't like was that it's not completely linear; there's a chapter about her 56-year-long marriage to Marty Ginsburg, ending with his death, and then the next chapter starts talking about Marty's reaction to something! So that was slightly odd and I had to flip back a few pages to find the actual dates for what I was reading about now.

Other than that, though, the book was really interesting, and talks about the cases she argued before the Supreme Court before becoming a justice, her nomination and senate confirmation to the Court, and the cases she's seen since becoming a justice. It talks about how Ruth and Marty balanced their work and home lives, in a way that was definitely not normal at the time; Marty was a full partner in parenting and housework, taking over all of the cooking and the 2 am infant feedings because it was easier for him to get back to sleep!

Overall, this was a really neat look into the life of one of the U.S.'s most prominent female figures right now. Justice Ginsburg has been a tireless fighter for equality for her entire career, and this book reveals some of her motivations and thought processes. I loved it.",1521936000,5

8116,359,200,"The protagonist, Richard Mayhew, begins with a bumbling self-consciousness that is reminiscent of the younger of Patrick de Witt's 'Sisters Brothers' as well as of Gaiman's Fat Charlie in 'The Anansi Boys'. Both of those are half of a pair, however, whereas Richard has to find his way alone to becoming a whole person and creating his own destiny from the chances that his generous personality have provided.

Richard's fairytale development, or Jungian hero story, echoes Nietzsche's ""I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are the over-goers"" in a very literal way. The bulk of the story takes place in Below London, an archetype-inhabited city of all the people and places that have fallen through the cracks of the real world over the centuries. In this subterranean version of London he meets such rich and memorable characters as Old Bailey and the Angel Islington, the sane and insane, the kind, brave, foolish, cruel, the moral, immoral and amoral, the dead and the undead.

So I was very pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be pretty excellent and yet another ""western"" that I can say I actually liked. I've been dithering about stars, so as usual take stars with a grain of salt. It's a great book. I'm pretty sure it will be on lists of the best of 2018.

It's a bloody awful mess quite literally, but it's effective and affecting. It's easy sometimes to forget that racism happens everywhere and that other countries have horrific and bloody histories when it comes to indigenous peoples or people different from the dominant.

Tommy and Billy McBride have lived a relatively innocent life with their parents, sister and father's ranch workers, despite the reality of a drought which is killing their cattle. Their parents have raised them well and protected them from the worst of human nature. When the boys are in their mid-teens (fourteen and sixteen, respectively) they arrive home from an afternoon of swimming to find a fateful and senseless tragedy.

The boys, on their own now, turn to their most wealthy neighbor, John Sullivan who calls in Inspector Noone and his band of Native Queensland police. We watch as the two of them pervert the boys suffering into vengeance, push them (and the native police) to take part in a genocide of the Kurrong tribe, and eventually cause a rift between the brothers that will last forever.

It's gut wrenching to watch the two young boys taken from relative safety and innocence to bloodlust and mental turbulence. It's terrifying to see how misplaced trust or anger can alter morality and belief. While this is set in the late 1800s of Australia, the lessons it paints carry great meaning everywhere still.",1521936000,5
8118,790,1952,"Most certainly would Peter Schweizers recently released Secret Empires keep a Special prosecutor occupied for years to come, the book also serves as a textbook for encouraging term limits. Some of the material presented was known by this reader, yet a majority came as a surprise.

It is no secret that Mitch McConnell has soft positions when it comes to China, but it was surprising how close his wifes shipping family is with the Chinese Communist Party. When Elaine Chao was Secretary of Labor, this reader on two occasions sat across the aisle from her on United Airlines non-stop flight from Beijing to Chicago. It was on the second occasion that I was left wondering why does the Secretary of Labor travel to China so frequently? Now we know.

As one reads through the various chapters, you simply wonder how these people get away with this stuff. If President Trump did half of the deals in office that evidently Penny Pritzker did as Secretary of Commerce under Obama, he would be promptly tarred and feathered by the most trusted name in news. The section of Jared Kushner was interesting, although it seems that at this time the only thing that he can be charged with is not being the smartest businessman.

While Joe Biden hints at running for president in 2020, with this book now on the streets, there is no way that he can. The multiple deals for his son Hunter in China and the Ukraine, while his father was actively involved in both countries hints for a Special Prosecutor. And that goes as well for the step-son of John Kerry, Chris Heinz, who was involved with Hunter Biden in several of these get rich awfully fast schemes. And perhaps more frightening is the expansion of China into the South China Sea, an action that could have been, should have been, stopped by Joe Biden & John Kerry but was not, and this reader wonders why.

8121,941,1838,"This story takes you on a journey through different lands and different times.
The Queen's Rising is a good solid tale. It has everything a book like this should. Political intrigue, deeply hidden secrets, an intricate dangerous plan, blood and death, betrayal, love and loss. If it's supposed to be in there it is!
The beginning of the book moves a little slowly but it's so interesting learning about the different passions and getting to see how close all the girls become while studying to be the very best. The thing about it is that it seemed to slow a little but it was taking the time to build up to what was going to happen next. It's a little hard to explain without giving anything away so I'll simply say the first half of the book was good. It introduced you to a lot of characters, many of which aren't in the book past the first half but it showed great friendships and it was like a story in and of itself. You were also given hints of things that would be very important. Then the second half started up and it just went crazy good. So many things happened! The story really picked up and a great many things begin to happen. I don't want to slip and give anything away but after the sweetness of the first part of the book, this second part is much more action/adventure type and maybe there is some blood and gore, just a little maybe. It's still character driven, but it's just so very good. The story comes to life and the plot takes shape. A whole new cast of characters are introduced and most from the first half are no longer in the book. New places are introduced. This just become all sorts of brilliant and the real story is front and center.
I know I'm not giving a lot of information here but as I type this there are very few reviews up and I don't want to spoil anything! I think the book synopsis says all you really need to jump into the story. It would be horrible to spoil the book for you. It's quite good and worth reading and seeing what you think for yourself. I enjoyed it maybe you will too.",1521936000,4
8122,304,1400,"Well that was a waste of time. This book spends its entire length asking one real question. Will the main character's baby survive? There are a number of smaller questions - Will the baby be born normal? Why is evolution turning backwards, or sideways? What happened to the main character's father? What happened to her friend from the hospital? What happened to her husband? Does she ever find freedom?

THE BOOK ANSWERS NONE OF THESE QUESTIONS.

I am really frustrated with this book. Why did I bother reading it if it refuses to resolve any of its plotlines?

We're going to get a little bit into writing theory here. It has been a classic recommendation to have the climax of your book 2/3 of the way through the book, and have the last third be denouement. Wrap-up. Show us how the climax affected the characters and the world. John Green does this well - all his books follow a standard plot line. Character A is introduced. A meets B. B changes A's life. B leaves A's life. (Those last two are usually incorporated in the climax of the book.) A has to learn how to live without B in a world changed by B's existence in it. It's a little formulaic, but it works for Green, and his books are great. Some books do not do this so well. Wheel of Time had 5-6 pages of denouement after the series climax, and nothing was really revealed about how the events changed the world for the better. Future Home of the Living God had TWO. TWO PAGES AFTER THE CLIMAX. AND THEY ANSWER NOTHING. The main character talks about missing winter.

I finished the book and almost threw it across the room. I probably would have, except for two things: I was at a friend's house, and it was a library book. That's all that saved it from that fate. I have stacks of books I want to read, and I feel like I just wasted a few hours on this piece of crap.

The writing was actually pretty good, and the main character is an Ojibwe Indian, so there's minority representation, but the book as a whole was just CRAP. Wrap up your plotlines. Answer the questions you ask. (At least the ones having to do with your plot - you can leave unanswered philosophical questions, that's fine.)

8124,255,1926,"The Sandman (SM) by Lars Kepler, actually a husband and wife writing team, is the 4th of six Joona Linna novels.  Joona is with National (Swedish) Crime and much of the action takes place in the Stockholm area.  I was recently drawn to this book by a NYT Janet Maslin review.  In her review she mentions that the series never quite caught on as hoped for in the US back in 2014, and she theorizes it was due to all the competition from better known Scandi authors, Nesbo, Stieg Larsson et al.  Im not so sure that I agree with that.  I recall the introduction of the first Joona book, The Hypnotist (HY) and the publicity surrounding its release.  My recollection was that reviews were mixed and that many critics focused negatively on the gore and torture in the story; I decided to pass.  Upon the recent reissue of SM, I read another somewhat favorable review in the Washington Post and decided to give the series a try. Bad decision.

The story starts off well enough.  A psycho killer, Jurek, is held in isolation in a suite of cells behind quadruple levels of security, ala Hannibal Lecter.  One cant escape several parallels between the two (I am tempted to cite the delicious quote of Senator Lloyd Bentsen but Ill resist).  It is assumed he knows the location of a young girl held in captivity and she is in danger of dying within days.  How to get the information?  Thats the set-up, and one big problem with the plot is that most of us can do a rough outline of the rest of the story.  Dont believe me?  OK, major plot point number two..cmon, think about it.thats right, plant a cop in one of the adjoining suite cells, a female cop right? A gorgeous female cop!

Yes, it gets a bit predictable, and gory.  And we learn an awful lot about drugs used to treat psychos (and some of us).  And some plot points really strain credibility.  To the breaking point.  As when Jurek whispers to cellmate #3 (a real bad guy brought in with gorgeous cop just to trick Jurek into believing gorgeous cops cover story) an order to take a nearby electric cord, sling it over the door, and hang himself.  And guess what #3 does?  Maybe these authors are a bit too much into hypnotism.  So what is hero Joona doing all this time?  He is the guy who captured Jurek long ago.  He knows Jurek.  He can anticipate what Jurek is going to do.  So when all the other cops come to a consensus on what their next step should be, Joona jumps in and tells them they are all wrong and they have to do the exact opposite.  Joona is a bore and I don't really care what has happened to Joona.  Its not a good thing when you don't care for your hero.

SM felt to me like a one-set play for most of the story, lots of dialog, monitoring of conversations etc.  Then the tail end becomes an action thriller.  I can almost see the movie trailers now.

Note that I mentioned re-issue in the opening paragraph.  The first book, HY, has been re-translated, and is in the process of being reissued; the original version does not seem the be available.  However, other books in the series are available on Amazon, some in paper, some on Kindle.  I mention all this just in case some of you may be drawn to the series and may read other entries.  Not me.",1521936000,2
8125,304,1391,"So much to say about this outstanding debut novel! First I'd like to address the issues around the author, then I'll delve into the book itself. (It's fantastic, though!)

So the book has been touted as an ""own voices"" novel, seemingly much to the author's chagrin. She is Muslim, but she's a white convert (Chakraborty is her married name). She has striven to correct the misconception about her ethnicity when she finds it, tweeting about it and talking about it in interviews. (This interview is a good example.) Because the book is pure fantasy, in a fantasy realm after the first few chapters, I'm not too worried about it not actually being written by a middle-eastern author. She does note in the interview I linked that she's not qualified to write some stories because of her ethnicity, and I appreciate that recognition of privilege. As far as I can tell, (as a white person myself) she did justice to the bits of mythology that she included. (Given the reception by people who were so excited about it being an Own Voices book, I think I'm probably right.) Her twitter (@SChakrabs) is FULL of links to minority authors and retweets about their books. I am very impressed by the level of her advocacy for minority authors.

So that aside, I LOVED THIS BOOK. I almost always enjoy fantasy inspired by non-western mythology:Children of Blood and Bone was fantastic, and though Forest of a Thousand Lanterns had a western fairytale at its heart, being reimagined through an Asian lense was really neat to read. The Bear and The Nightingale and The Girl in the Tower were Russian inspired, as were The Crown's Game/The Crown's Fate. I really do try to pick up non-western inspired fantasy when I can. City of Brass scratched that itch perfectly.

City of Brass opens in Cairo, where our heroine, Nahri, is a con-woman with small healing magics. When a ritual goes awry, she's thrust into the world of the djinn. It's when Nahri and her accidental bodyguard, Dara, arrive at the Djinns' city of Daevabad that the story really gets started.

I'm still a little confused about the difference between djinn and Daeva; Daeva seem to be one of the tribes but also the name for the entire race, and some of them get offended at being called djinn but some of them don't? I'm not really sure about that distinction. There is a clear line between djinn and Ifrit, though - Ifrit are immensely powerful, immortal beings who refused to subject themselves to punishment many centuries ago. I'm not sure I actually see a downside to being Ifrit, other than the djinn all think they're evil. The Ifrit, however, are out to get Nahri, and Dara's not having any of THAT.

I love Dara - he's a fascinating character, with a violent, mysterious backstory. I'm very eager to read more about him and figure out exactly what's up with his background. Nahri is also awesome - a little arrogant, but by the end of the book she's starting to learn she might need help from those around her. Unfortunately, also by the end of the book she doesn't know who to trust. The naive djinn prince, Ali, is the third main character of the book, and while I can see him having an interesting story, his personality is still a little flat. Hopefully the second book will see advancement in all three of these characters' personalities.

And I can't WAIT for the second book! City of Brass didn't exactly end on a cliffhanger, but it did leave many questions unanswered and our main characters' fates uncertain. Unfortunately, I can't find any information on the sequel, just that it's being edited. No release date or title yet.

Read this book. It's fantastic.",1521936000,5
8126,471,471,"Well, I don't think I hated it. But I most certainly didn't like it either. I don't even mind that it's waaay more religious than I first suspected. It's just this book will only be interesting or surprising to children...or the overly sentimental.

It's kinda funny that a book less than 200 pages can feel padded. But the entire allegory goes pretty much exactly the way you think it will. And I'm not spoiling anything by saying that of course the 'hidden treasure' at the Pyramids will be a letdown. Of course it's not the destination but the journey, and all the friends you make along the way. Gag gag gag gag gag.

I wish I enjoyed it more. I really enjoyed the prologue. And then it went all downhill with a roundabout sunday school lesson. If you want to relive sunday school stories but with a slightly exotic flair, then this is for you. If that doesn't sound like fun (and it probably doesn't), skip this.",1521936000,2
8127,621,3,"Murder on the Orient Express was my first experience with an Agatha Christie book, although I suspect that I would enjoy all of them. I decided to listen to the audiobook version of the mystery, as Dan Stevens was the narrator and I thought his performance in Beauty and the Beast was spectacular. He did a fantastic job bringing each of the characters to life, although I feel that this story would have been wonderful with a full cast. Just a warning though, there are many recordings of this tale and you might be listening to another narrator like Kenneth Branagh (who played Poirot in the recent movie) or David Suchet.

The story itself was engaging and not on the nose. There were aspects of the mystery that I deduced for myself, as clues were revealed and conversations overheard but I didn't figure everything out before the reveal. That was really nice because sometimes mysteries don't end up being an actual mystery. I even found myself yelling at Poirot's companions because they clearly were missing some of the facts and sometimes he had to lay things out for them very plainly.

Despite the fact that this is a relatively short book, Christie managed to write a lovely mystery and I am very happy that I finally got a chance to read it. I definitely plan to read more of her works in the future.",1522022400,4
8128,1133,722,"You know when you pick up a book because it was a suggestion by a celebrity and you're not really sure what to expect? This was the case for me with this book. I picked it up because Reese Witherspoon's book club pick was Erotic Stores for Punjabi Widows for the month of March. When I read the synopsis I thought hmm this will be different. And it was...in a good way!

This story is about a lot of different kinds of Punjabi women trying to find their way. It's set in London but also references India in some parts. We meet Nikki who was supposed to follow a certain career path based on her Dad's wishes but she ends up working at a Bar instead. She goes down to the temple one day and see's a listing for an English class teacher. This is a free class and is offered to the widows in the community. Nikki thinks she is going to teach them how to read and write English but she's in for a big surprise when they start ""telling their stories""

While this is happening we are also trying to figure out a mystery. Nikki's boss had a daughter who is no longer alive. There are a lot of theories going around the community but Nikki helps uncover some new information that may just incriminate the right person(s). However, she has to be careful because the ""brothers"" of the community are watching her...

As you can see this story is two fold. Theres a romance side (erotic stories, I mean it is in the name) and a mystery to be ironed out. I went into this story not knowing much about the Punjabi culture but if there's any truth to it then I really want to hang out with these widows! They are saucy and I loved it. Romance is not something I read very often but this had just the right amount to keep it spicy but also keep you invested in the overall story.

I would say pick this one up if you want a mystery that also has a little hot sauce to it!",1522022400,4

8130,307,76,"I hate to admit that I am influenced by reviews written by people who are Russian and also those who are Russian historians. They claim that this book, which is a novel, did not paint a true picture of Russia at this time in history.  I do not know and cannot judge these criticisms. I enjoyed the book, and felt Towles did a fine job of writing. The Count is a wonderful character.  Life at the grand Metropol  hotel is never dull.
The fact that Count Alexander Rostov's life sentence is to never leave the hotel, did seem to be soft hearted, when compared to everybody else's sentence of death or life in prison. Therefore, the book is about day to day life at the Metropol.  The Count is content and there did not seem to be much of a story.  I kept feeling that there was no plot, it was more like a diary, which was ok because I was enjoying the read.  There was a wealth of historical information, which interfered with the activities at the Metropol.  Every book or movie should have a dog, cat or child.  ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" has a child.  Nina, also a hotel guest, is a delightful young girl and adds to the story and to the Count's life. Time passes and Nina returns and leaves her daughter Sofia for a short visit with the Count. but Nina does not return and Count Rostov becomes Sofia's Papa'.  Rostov is not poor he has a desk with hollow legs, and the legs are filled with gold coins. All in all life is pretty good for Count Alexander Rostov, at the Metropol with his gold coins and his darling daughter.  You will meet  the hotel staff, who become family to our prisoner.  There is a great appreciation of food, because the Count is a gourmet and the best food in Russia is served at the famous Boyarsky, which is in the hotel.  Oh, I forgot there is a cat with one eye, and also a beautiful actress who loves the count.  Not a bad life for the prisoner",1522022400,4
8131,1038,417,"I loved and hated this book. In an alternate present day, people receive a call just after midnight letting them know it is their ""end day.""

Both boys are parent-less (Mateo's mother dead, his father in a coma; Rufus's entire family killed in a tragic car accident). Seeking solace in a friend, they find one another on the Last Friend App.

The next 24 hours are filled with adventure, friendship, love, loss, and impending doom. As a reader you are continually reminded that no one has ever eluded Death-Cast's prediction for death. The boys will die but we don't know when or how.

As the clock ticks down, the reader can't help hoping for a happy ending, a miracle that will save them both. But the title of this book is The Both Die At The End.

8133,621,1697,"I was immediately drawn into Everless because the cover was so intriguing. The detail of the world within the hourglass drew me in and I wasn't disappointed by the story. The premise was unique: time is currency in this world and can be harnessed from your blood. As in most societies, there is incredible stratification and inequality. The poor must sell their time to survive while the rich horde time and live for hundreds of years.

The main character Jules finds herself in the employ of one of the wealthy families and embroiled in more trouble than she ever expected. Despite the fact that her father always warned her against returning to the Gerling estate, she didn't listen and hoped that she could make enough while in their service to give her father more time. She is both fiercely loyal and trusting, which is not always a positive in this environment. I found her to be likable and rooted for her success or survival.

There were aspects of the plot that I found to be a little formulaic and to be expected, but others that surprised me. It was a good mix of feeling like I was figuring things out as the main character did and being surprised by reveals.

I am a sucker for a smooth talking cowboy and I have to say Ranger definitely dazzled, he was charming and sweet when the moment called for it, and certainly knew his way to a woman's heart!

Ranger is an astronomer and up for a promotion at the observatory and needs a wife to help him advance his career. Ember feels she can use her matchmaking skills to help him find that special someone. What she doesn't realize is that Ranger has his sight on his best friend but doesn't know how to change that status. Through some bad matchmaking and miscommunications, Ranger finally gets Ember to realize she's the right one for him. In typical fashion the heroine has to come to this realization on her own and goes to great extent to win her man back. I truly love her writing because it is so descriptive and captures the essence of Ember and Ranger's friendship and how hard it is for them to switch gears without hurting the relationship.

8146,757,1955,"The Other Mother is an intense psychological thriller. Its confusing and disturbing, but fascinating. Nothing in this book is what it appears to be. There are many twists and surprises throughout the novel. All the pieces, though, do come together in the end.

Daphne Marist and Laurel Hobbs met in a support group for women suffering from intrusive thoughts and postpartum psychosis/depression. The two women became fast friends, confiding in one another their deepest thoughts and fears. Laurel encouraged Daphne to sharpen her appearance. Daphne readily agreed and changed her hairstyle, clothes, accessories, and behavior, to match her new, more confident friend, Laurel Hobbs. Their intense friendship, however, crumbled. Did their husbands sabotage it, or did they break it themselves?

 When Daphnes life began to spin out of control, she split from her husband and took infant Chloe with her. Daphne headed for the Catskills where a job awaited her. She started her new life under the assumed name, Laurel Hobbs. It was there, however, where Daphnes chaotic world turned into a never-ending nightmare. A world where layers of deceit and betrayals were exposed.

The Other Mother is a cleverly crafted thriller, where cunning characters come to life.  A word of caution to the reader, Postpartum Psychosis/Depression, Intrusive Thoughts, suicide and Borderline Personality, are addressed in this intriguing, dark novel.

8147,275,1955,"In The Other Mother, Carol Goodman skillfully utilizes the unreliable narrator plot device which results in an engrossing, twist-filled mystery.

Daphne Marist and Laurel Hobbes meet at a support group meeting for new mothers who are struggling with postpartum disorders. Their daughters are both named Chloe and they strike up an unlikely friendship. Daphne is a former school librarian whose older husband manages a small hedge fund. Laurel is also married to a much older man but she is wealthy and attended exclusive schools in Europe. They quickly become inseparable and Laurel helps transform Daphne into her own image. Daphne eventually takes a job as an archivist for her favorite author Schuyler Sky Bennett and moves with Chloe to Skys estate in the Catskills which is next to the Crantham Psychiatric Center. Daphne becomes quite curious about former mental patient Edith Sharp and she finds herself in an shocking situation that she might not be able to escape.

Despite her sympathetic plight, Daphne is not an easy character to like at first. She is a bit of a doormat and does not really stand up for herself. Peter rules the roost and she easily gives in to him. She loves Chloe but she is overwhelmed by obsessive thoughts and fears. Her friendship with Laurel is not exactly healthy since, just like her marriage, Daphne follows wherever Laurel leads.

For the first half of the novel, Daphne is an incredibly unreliable narrator whose grasp on reality seems rather tenuous. She has trouble differentiating between fact and fantasy. She is also unsure whether her memories can be trusted.

Is Daphne just using Laurels identity to escape from Peter? Or does Daphne believe she is, in fact, Laurel? Well, that question is answered when her situation takes a shocking turn and Daphne finds herself in an increasingly precarious position. Will Daphne be able to convince anyone that she is telling the truth?

The Other Mother is an intriguing mystery where nothing or no one is quite as it first appears. Carol Goodman slowly parcels the truth through diary entries written by various characters. Although a couple of the plot twists are slightly implausible, the novel comes a stunning conclusion that is quite satisfying.

I received a complimentary copy for review.",1522108800,4
8148,302,1955,"The Other Mother by Carol Goodman is a highly recommended Gothic tale of motherhood and madness.

Daphne Marist meets her best friend, Laurel Hobbes, at a Westchester support group for new mothers with postpartum depression. The two women both have daughters named Chloe and both are married to controlling older men. They quickly become close friends and soon Daphne is going to Laurel's gym, visiting her hair stylist, and wearing similar clothes. While Laurel seems to suddenly be in a downward spiral, and her husband confides in Daphne that she is mentally ill, Daphne's husband, Peter, seems intent on still questioning her own mental stability and fitness as a parent.

Daphne takes her infant daughter, Chloe, and secretly leaves her husband and home. Assuming Laurel's identity and credentials, she accepts a job under Laurel's name as a live-in archivist for Schuyler Bennett, an author whose Catskills' mansion borders the grounds of a psychiatric institution where her father, Dr. Bennett, was once the director. Daphne tells no one her true identity and tries to involve herself in her job while piecing together what has been happening to her and uncovering secrets found in Bennett's papers.

The Other Mother is presented in three parts and includes excerpts from several different journals along with Daphne's first-person narrative. Daphne's thoughts clearly make her an unreliable narrator; you can't tell if she is having a mental break with reality or if there is some underhanded plot to make her think she is mentally ill and has lost touch with reality. Clearly, both husbands are controlling jerks, but is Daphne unwell?

Goodman presents a very twisty plot of domestic suspense brimming with unreliable narrators, tangled identities, and dark motives where secrets are slowly uncovered. Daphne's character is developed, but since she is also unreliable and suffering from postpartum OCD. She is full of doubt and confusion. The writing is quite good, but the big twist at the end left me shaking my head. And, no spoilers, but there is a certain point where I kept thinking a very simple blood test should have been done and would have answered a vital question. 3.5

While hes trying to figure out what happened to Elspeths memories, a barrage of strange accidents keep befalling Elspeth, accidents that funnily enough would have killed a normal person, but as Wyatt quickly learns, theres more to Elspeth than meets the eye.

What I really enjoyed the most about Twice Bitten was seeing the family dynamic. Elspeths family is established. It is not new and just starting out. She and her siblings are grown (even if they are still considered young in Immortal years), and should be out on their own in the world. Yet tragedies in her mothers past prevents Elspeths mother from letting her children go. Its, at times, a toxic dynamic, but I think it speaks a lot about the burden that older Immortals carry. Those old enough to have seen the evils in the world repeatedly and how they're subsequently effected.

The problems with Elspeths apparent memory loss were subtle yet in the end turned out to deal with a bigger picture-type issue. I liked how Lynsay Sands tied it all together, however, I think we could have felt the impact of her memory loss more if we had more snippets of what happened on that day four years ago when she and Wyatt met. It was just a little short of satisfying for me in that regard.

Overall, Sands Argeneau series never fails to entertain. Ive enjoyed the break weve had from the previous story arc involving the missing Immortals where we get to see what else is happening concurrently with the hunt in Venezuela. Some not-so-veiled references have me wondering if were set to revisit that storyline in the next book.",1522108800,4
8152,924,1837,"The Ian Rutledge series is Charles Todd's best, and this one was, once again, intelligently plotted. We see a little of Melinda Crawford, my favorite character after Rutledge. Frances, his sister, has just gotten married, and Inspector Rutledge is feeling a bit peripatetic. On a late-night drive, he comes upon a murdered man, and thus begins a complex, brilliantly plotted story. It seems as if Rutledge keeps searching, following leads, and nothing clicks until later in the book. The characters have gotten to asking him when he's going to find the murderer. And Hamish, the Scottish soldier whose ghost haunts him from the ""great war,"" is as usual helpful and always ready to offer a second opinion.

This mother and son writing team really struck gold with Inspector Rutledge, the stronger of their two series. I'm wondering if at some point they decide to marry off Rutledge; it would be fascinating to see how he deals with Hamish as a married man. The ending of the book hinted that romance was ahead!",1522108800,4
8153,258,819,"2.5 stars

Retelling of Rear Window(1954) with James Stewart and Grace Kelly, minus the charm... this round the housebound main character is an unlikable female agoraphobic and former child psychologist who has given up on the outside world after a tragic event.  She drinks too much wine, is whacked on meds, possibly hallucinating, pushy AF, lurks a great deal on the Internet, and spends an obnoxious amount of time being a smack-worthy nosy neighbor via her windows... a seemingly unreliable narrator who may or may not have witnessed a murder by her neighbor across the way.

Kind of a despicable protagonist I never really took to.  Helpless and weak.  Her judgement is extremely poor--outright stupid-- and this made me wish she'd get institutionalized or that someone would just take her out.  Her ""Dr."" title was farcical.  Moreover, unlike Rear Window, no one here in this cast takes the place of Grace Kelly (who had more of a spine for a 1954 woman than the hot mess in this 21st century book)... just meh chemistry with Bina (a woman who shows up for exercise), neighbor Jane Russell, her tenant David, and Ethan, the teenage neighbor.  Grace Kelly's dynamic with the older Stewart as they chat and scheme and occasionally fool around was one of the best things about the movie.  This here is just some old movie fanboy fanfic. Though much like Rear Window... one does wonder why people don't close their dang blinds when they're up to no good!!!  Who is that dumb????  Implausible!!!  This book picks up the worst of Rear Window and ignores the best.  I just didn't care about any of these people.

I did like all the descriptive language and all the nods to old movies, though.  ""Jane Russell"" was a nice touch, ha ha.  Nothing particularly original here plot-wise but engaging enough plot (I didn't say characters) due to the competent writing.  It's a serviceable retelling that could make for a half decent new movie based on the old (author already has a movie deal)... but ultimately telling of Hollywood's inability to come up with new material.  Does it rate all the attention it's getting?  Nope. Just one of those new releases that goes viral but isn't really great or original... amazing how often this happens.  An okay read but definitely overhyped.  If you look at the author's rsum you'll see he's gotta have friends in high places... you do the math.",1522108800,3
8154,898,1956,"Argeneau #27, What I love about this series is that they can be read as a stand alone. Even with as big as this family is and all the characters where it would be easy to get lost in all the characters Sands is really good about that in this one there were only four, five extra Argeneau couples, including my favorite couple Marguerite and Julius, as well as some family members who haven't found their life mates yet, and a couple of humans; despite the large cast of characters it's so easy to follow. The third person POV mainly follows Elspeth and some of Wyatt. This this still running parallel timeline wise with Immortal Nights and Immortal Unchained. Another thing I love about this series is the science behind their immortality and how they get all grumpy about being called vampires. Sands is such a talented writer for being able to continue on with this series without it getting boring, and refreshing past couples stories in the current book without over explaining or making it feel redundant.

After 140 years of being under her mother's over protective thumb Elspeth was finally able to escape and move out on her own. She been working with the Rogue Hunters helping them sort through their tip line. After checking out one of those calls and getting attacked my a unbalanced human Elspeth comes home to her quant little apartment to find not only her Mother but her twin sisters as well who've come for an unwelcome visit. In need of blood and rest Elspeth's Mom keeps trying to get Elspeth to take blood from the gorgeous landlady's grandson who just happened to be visiting also. Elspeth is able to resist her mother and she comes to realize being in pain helped to resist her mother. Wyatt was surprised to find Elspeth living in his grandmother's upstairs apartment and even more surprised to realize that she doesn't even remember him.

Wyatt knows something is up so he follows Elspeth, after Wyatt catches up Elspeth realizes Wyatt could be her life mate then she gets pushed in front of a car and Wyatt learns what she is and what he is to her. Attempts on her life keep happening and Wyatt is determined to keep her safe. With these coinciding with her Mother's appearance in town no one is for if it's her or someone else is behind the attacks. In one of the attempted attacks, donuts laced with cyanide, Wyatt almost dies and Elspeth brings him over. But it only gets worse before it gets better.

Overall, this was such a fun read, it brought back several women from the earlier books that I loved and the story was so good. Elspeth's dastardly mother and what she did was reprehensible at least her annoying sister were redeemable in the end. Wyatt and Elspeth were just wow, I loved them together. I want G.G. to get his own story.",1522108800,5
8155,552,1956,"I love reading Lynsay Sands. Whether its her Paranormal, Contemporary or her Historical Romance series, I always feel fulfilled after reading one of her stories. I can continually count on her to write fun and interesting characters, to constantly bring a smile to my face and to always have a little bit of mystery to make everything interesting. Twice Bitten is exactly what I expected from her.

Wyatt was totally unexpected. A mortal who fell in love with El and then lost her when she just didn't show up. He was thoughtful, sexy and one of the most understanding men I have ever read. He knew what to say and when to say it and said it directly from his heart. There was nothing about this man that I didn't love  including his Gran.

El was, unfortunately, smothered by her mother. When she finally did get away from her, it was only for her to come to Canada from England and then take control of her life again. But, she finds out that pain can stop this overbearing, hurtful woman from entrancing her again. She finds a solution to this but gives Wyatt a heart-attack every time she does it. Then again, with someone trying to kill her, she is constantly in pain. When she finds out the extent to which her mother took her suffocating ways, she has no choice but to confront her and put an end to her domineering mothering. Shell have Wyatt and the rest of the Argeneaus by her side and her sisters will have their freedom.

Lynsay Sands actually wrote a character that I hated. Martine was a bitch! She got under my skin, pissed me off and was just damn rotten. Understandably, she had her reasons, but she took being a doting mother just a little too far. It takes near death and threats for her to finally leave her children alone, return home and confess all to her husband. Then comes the weepies for me when El's father shows up and my heart just bursts.

Like I said in the beginning, Lynsay Sands just enthralls me. She writes stories that are so intriguing and has you turning page after page. She's fluent, fun and her writing is just plain wonderful. Again, she amazes me that she is still writing the Argeneau series and keeping it fresh and entertaining. I will be devastated if she ever decides to stop writing about this wonderful family.

8157,888,1957,"London  -  Mrs. Trilbys Agency for Superior Governesses

Miss Mari Perkins has arrived a few minutes late for her appointment with Mrs. Trilby because she tried to help a lame girl across the road and some ruffians stole her trunk.  Mari has been promised a position as governess to Mr. Folsom who has 8 children, but the job has been given to someone else because she was late.  Mari was raised as an orphan in a charity school, but she is very well educated.  Even though Mrs. Trilby has told her to leave her office, she slips back inside just as another governess arrives to quit a difficult job.  When Mari overhears that the position the woman has left is with the Duke of Bansford of Grosvenor Square, she takes off to apply for the job herself.

Edgar, the Duke of Bansford and his sister, Lady India Rochester, are chatting when Mari arrives requesting to be considered for the position of governess.  Edgar had a liaison with a French woman who later gave birth to twins, Michel and Adele.  Edgar just found out about the 9-year-old children after the death of their mother.  He has had several governesses but the children have run them off.  Mari convinces him that she can do the job.

Soon, Mari enchants the children by taking them out and teaching them history first hand by visiting historical sites.  She also proves to them that they cannot scare her off with snakes and such which has terrified their other governesses.

Mari is a petite and pretty young woman and Edgar tries not to let himself be enticed by her.  However, she stands up to him and does not let him intimidate her which only intrigues him more.

When Mari had been left at the orphanage, a bible and a unique toy were left with her.  Mari wants to find out if these items could help her discover who her mother was.

I enjoyed this book and found Mari to be intelligent and in her element with children.  Edgar is OK but seems to lack self confidence.  Im sure this can be traced back to his childhood.  I think readers will be intrigued by Edgars sister, India, and I cant help but hope there might be a book in the works centered on her.  Be sure to read this book.  Its filled with lots of things that will keep you turning the pages.

I love both of those stories individually, however I found the similarities between them and this book are almost parallel and that made me feel like this story lacked originality. I was pleasantly surprised when I found a part of the story that was original and it is the part of the book that I loved, when our heroine founds out who her family was and was reconnected with her father. I found that all to be so endearing.  I wish this book had more of an original story line to it so I could like it in its entirety but sadly I am left disappointed.",1522108800,4
8160,194,1957,"This is a fun, easy, unputdownable read. It's so enjoyable I finished it in only a couple of hours. The characters are engaging, from Edgar and Mari to India and Ravenwood, to the children, to the servants and tradesmen. There is an element of inside joke with the duke and governess pairing and I appreciate that being a long-time reader of historical romance.
Mari's comparison to Mary Poppins is apt because she is capable and amazing with the twins Michel and Adele. I love that she's bold and determined, she goes after what she wants.
I like Edgar and his struggle to not be like his father and fight his attraction for Mari. I love that he wants what's good for his children and he doesn't look down on his servants. I adore that he's a great brother and son, father and lover.
The secondary characters are wonderful, especially the twins, India, and Grafton. I'm glad Lenora held back on India because she is such a fascinating supporting cast member. I didn't feel as if she overshadowed the main characters, which is good because I'm looking forward to her book. Despite so many named people in the book, What a Difference a Duke Makes remained Edgar and Mari's book.
The story flowed smoothly and the pacing was just right.
If I have a minor complaint, it would be that Edgar and Mari are incredibly virtuous while the villains have no redeeming qualities. Also, that Mari may be a tad forward for a virgin and someone who was sequestered in a strict orphanage. Other than these, I really like this book. It's a 4.5 for me.",1522108800,4
8161,129,1957,"I have never read anything from this author, but I really liked the synopsis, so I figured why not try it.

I liked Mari and Edgar well enough. Theyre both good people, smart, and they have excellent banter. The kids were pretty cute and I enjoyed their interactions with everyone. And Edgars sister India was probably the best part.

Plot wise, it was sort of meh. There are a lot of moving pieces and some of them didn't feel necessary. The very small bit of conflict was more of an annoyance and was resolved in a chapter. My main complaint is that I didn't see the chemistry outside of the banter. Were told that each one is attracted to the other, but it didn't actually translate for me.

Overall, it was a quick read with characters I liked. Im not sure if I would read the next one. Unless its India and a hate to love with her rival.

8163,111,1957,"Lenora Bells fabulous debut novel had cured my reading funk when it came out, and the extraordinary WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES outshines How the Duke Was Won on every level!

Mari Perkins had worked too hard to be instantaneously turned away from Mrs. Trilbys Agency for Superior Governesses. On her way to the agency, Maris possessions were stolen, and she needs a position; she has nothing left. Almost on her way out, Mari hears that the Duke of Banksfords new governess just quit, and Mari gets herself hired by the Duke. His nine year-old twins, Michel and Adele, are unmanageable, but nothing that Mari cant handle. Edgar Rochester, Duke of Banksford, is busy with his steam engines; he needs peace and quiet, but governesses are forever leaving, so he reluctantly agrees to a one-week trial for Mari. It doesnt take long before Edgar realises it had been a mistake to hire Miss Perkins 

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES has a bit of a Mary Poppins vibe, but its not all fluff and froth. I was invested in Mari and Edgars story from the start because of Ms. Bells outstanding writing, her scintillating dialogues, the compelling and clever premise, and her exceptional characterisations, and this is only the beginning. Mari is very engaging, confident in her abilities, and her love and respect for children are palpable, this is done so well, that in one instance, it brought tears to my eyes. I believe Lenora Bell has written my favourite children in a romance novel ever. Michel and Adele are intrinsic components of the story, and the link to much growth from several characters. In spite of appearing unbending and gruff, Edgars heart is in the right place, and his backstory is one of the best I have ever seen, and makes believable things that otherwise might have been less convincing. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES provides the undeniable proof that solid backstories make for a more solid foundation to build the narrative, and supply the environment needed for characters to build and move on. The characters are works of art: every single one well fleshed out.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES unfolds at a brisk pace, and the prose is witty, sparkling, luminous; the writing is positively marvellous! Ms. Bells meticulous research shines through delightful period details about steam engines, fire brigades, child rearing, toys, books, which only serve to further enhance the genuineness of the story.

The romance isn't rushed; it builds slowly through trust, communication, respect, kindness, and Edgar is exactly the sort of hero I love reading about, and I wish there were more of his kind in romanceland. Mari is also on a personal quest, which concludes in a charming and whimsical manner; and Edgars relentless pursuit on improving fire engines contributes to the fabulous conclusion as well. There is no useless detail to this story, neither is there a single superfluous word, nor the slightest little lull. I cannot fail to mention the splendiferous India, Edgars sister, who captured my imagination like few characters do, and I am beyond thrilled that her story will be next; this is a book that will not release quickly enough! WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES has one of the most satisfying HEA ever; it is perfectly enchanting!

8165,1075,1328,"I read Their Eyes Were Watching God to fulfill the prompt of a book about feminism for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge.

I picked up this book last year for a quarter at a library book sale, thinking I would get to it sooner than I did. Id heard good things about it, but really didn't know what to expect (I thought based on the title it would deal with religion a lot more than it did), so when I was browsing the prompts for this years reading challenge and saw this one listed as being a feminism title, I decided to tackle it.

The story begins with Janie returning home alone, which sets her neighbors tongues to wagging. Everyone wants to know why shes back, and why shes alone. Her best friend Pheoby brings her some food by, and Janie pours out her tale to her.

Written in the 1930s, the book is far ahead of its time, not just in the ideas and actions put forth by Janie as a woman, but as a Black woman. I really did enjoy her story, loved the paths her life took and how she stayed true to herself throughout, which didn't always sit well with others.

While this is a tale of feminism, its also a love story. Its about how sometimes you have to follow your own heart instead of the path others would have you follow. Its about life and how things don't always turn out as planned, or even how we ever imagined them being.

As I could see where the novel was going toward the last part, my heart broke a little, but Im glad I took the journey with Janie, and saw her through to the end.

The only issue I had with the book (and think some others might find difficult as well) is the dialect-heavy dialogue. It does give an authentic touch, and having grown up in the south, I could hear the accents of people Ive known delivering the lines, but there was just so much of it at times that it slowed the flow of the story. Aside from that, this was an excellent book.

4 out of 5 stars.",1522108800,4
8166,986,325,"I've been wanting to read this novel for a long time now, probably ever since I first heard about it. I've become a fan of Ruta Sepetys' writing after reading Between Shades Of Gray and Out Of The Easy; both because of the fantastic writing and well researched and detailed historical settings and descriptions. Salt To The Sea without doubt fits all these points above. I have a weak spot for WWII historical fiction in general and I hadn't heard about the Wilhelm Gustloff incident before, so that was a double bonus for me. It truly shows in the little details just how well researched this novel is and the descriptions made it feel as if you were there yourself along with the characters. The plot is an interesting one and shows just how difficult it was to find your way to safety close to the end of the war. I admit it took me a while to get used to the multiple POVs and remembering who is who, which slowed down the pace inicially, but each different character and POV does show a different view on the situation and add something to the story. I was a bit annoyed by Alfred, who I didn't like at all and I wasn't sure about the particular style of his chapters. But the rest of the characters were interesting and I liked how the different styles used in each POV showed their different personalities. There is even some sort of interaction between the POVs and sometimes different characters tell their personal experience of the same event... Adding power to what was happening to them. Salt To The Sea is without doubt a very strong historical fiction read that shines the light on an event that is not all that well known. It's not my favorite Ruta Sepetys novel, but without doubt worth reading.",1522108800,4

8168,560,1954,"In this last installment of the Chandler/Kane saga, Evangaline Chandler, younger sister of Nicholas Chandler is crushing on Gabriel Hunter, tattoo artist and son of the Kane family housekeeper. There's a significant age difference between them, and since Gabe is also Nicholas' best friend, there's all the best-friend's-little-sister taboo thing going on. It isn't until they are forced to be together that the sparks have a chance to ignite.

Eve and Gabe's story takes place during Livvy and Nicholas's wedding week, a setting which provides for lots of family drama and revelations as one might expect, considering weddings typically bring out the best and worst in families! It was a good way to bring in the previous characters in the series, and I always enjoy that in a family based series. While Eve and Gabe have a few things to work first, their journey to happiness runs a gamut of emotions.

Hurts to Love You was true to it's title in that it was a very emotional story that demonstrates just how love can hurt too.  Overall, this is a terrific series, with complex diverse characters and Hurts to Love You provides a nice wrap-up for the series.  While you can read as a standalone, I would recommend reading in order to get the full impact of the family dynamics.",1522108800,4

I liked Ember and Ranger. They have a great history and I loved their wordless conversations and the spark they had between them. They complimented each other well. There are loads and loads and LOADS of other characters and I pretty much gave up trying to keep track of them.

Plot wise it was sort of lack luster. I did like the game with Dawn, but it just seemed like so much work when a conversation could have worked. Actually, the majority of this story is conflict due to lack of communication and thats where I started to get bored. There was a lot to unpack here and not all of it felt necessary.

8171,302,1958,"Tangerine by Christine Mangan is a recommended historical fiction suspense novel set in Tangier, Morocco, in 1956.

Alice Shipley has moved to Tangier with her new husband, John McAllister, for his job. McAllister is an obnoxious, disagreeable man who married Alice for her money.  He loves Tangier and is always off doing something in the city, while Alice finds the city terrible and oppressive. She is not adjusting to life there at all. However, the last person she expected to show up in Tangier for a visit was Lucy Mason, whom she hasn't spoken to for over a year.

Alice and Lucy first met when they were freshman at Bennington in the early 1950s. The roommates became inseparable and were the best of friends - until an unnamed accident happened and the two did not part on good terms. Now, Lucy has traveled to Tangier specifically to see Alice. Alice is surprised to see her after whatever mysterious incident happened between the two. What is clear is that Lucy closely watches everything and always has, and that she is obsessed with Alice. The setting adds to the oppressive feeling, as Alice struggles with the heat and foreignness of Tangier.

The writing is wonderfully descriptive. The setting is meticulously detailed, creating an atmospheric setting. The story develops in chapters that alternate between the the two women's point of view, and describe events in the present and the past. It is the unnamed, mysterious accident/incident that happened between the two while they were in college, combined with Lucy's obsession with Alice that creates the feeling of tension. There is an almost Hitchcockian aura surrounding the plot and dialogue.

As I was reading Tangerine a feeling persisted that I had read this novel before, or had seen this film before - only the elusive-unnamed-original was better than this novel. The trouble is that the tension and drama is based on the big secret, which is so slow to be revealed that it actually offers no huge surprise. Astute readers will likely have felt the same as I did from the beginning and have an excellent idea where the plot is going long before it meanders that direction.  Additionally, even though the two women are described as being very different, sometimes it is hard to tell whose voice you are reading, which is disconcerting. What I do think is true is that this book will make a good movie - which is probably why the film rights have already been sold.

8172,844,1958,"From the publisher:  Its about Alice Shipley and Lucy Mason, at one time the closest of friends, now wedged apart by a chilling secret.  They find themselves reunited in Morocco in 1956, where revolution is imminent, though it seems like the real warfare is between the two of them.  The dusty alleyways of Tangier have never felt so ominous.

First things first:  Tangerine is what you are called if you are of, or from, Tangiers.  The chapters p.o.v. alternates between Lucy and Alice, fittingly enough. The first belongs to Alice, musing as she looks out the window at the streets of Morocco, thinking back to her days at Bennington College, in Vermont, where she and Lucy, both 17, were best friends and roommates [having met on their very first day at college.]  And where she met John McAllister, to whom she is now married, although having decided not to change her name:  It felt important, somehow, to retain some part of myself, my family, after everything that had happened.  Trying to not think each and every second of the day about what had happened in the cold, wintry Green Mountains of Vermont.  It is now just over a year since that time.  (There are several references to what had happened, although the reader is not told what that everything was for quite a while, e.g., It was perhaps too much to hope for, I knew, that things would simply revert back to how they had once been, before that terrible  night.)

Lucy, who is a writer of obituaries for a local newspaper, first appears in Chapter Two, as she describes the intense heat of the city, where she finds the promise of the unknown, of something infinitely deeper, richer, than anything I had ever experienced in the cold streets of New York.  She has come to Tangiers for the express purpose of finding and joining Alice.  Born in a small town in Vermont, Tangiers is literally another world for her.  When she makes her way to Alices apartment, she finds it cluttered with books, by Dickens and others of that ilk, which is surprising to Lucy, as the Alice she had known was not a big reader.  I had tried to encourage her during our four years as roommaes, but try as I might to interest her, she had only stuck up her nose.  Theyre all just so serious, she had complained . . . she was made, it seemed, for living, rather than reading about the experiences of other lives.  When Lucy re-enters her life, Alice is delighted to see her once friend, the closest friend that I had even known before it had all gone wrong.  The tale goes along this way, with fascinating insights into the two women, and into this stifling city, and its people and places, so completely foreign to everything they have known till then.  The writing is fascinating, and the mystery, when it is finally made clear to the reader, well worth the time it took to get us there.

The Final Six is a Young Adult Science Fiction novel. There is a sequel planned.

The story is set in the future (the date is not specified). The basic premise is that the earth is in dire shape with floods and earthquakes. Twenty-four teens are being drafted to the International Space Training Camp. These teens will be competing to become one of six teens sent on a mission to Europa (Jupiters moon).

The narrators are teenagers Naomi and Leo (1st person POVs). Leo is from Italy and is an incredible swimmer. Naomi is from California and she is a science genius.

I really liked Naomi. She was a fantastic character. She was super close to her family. And I really liked how much she missed them. I also liked that she was kind and not out to sabotage other people.

I did like the competition. Although it sort of reminded me of another book, Dare Mighty Things by Heather Kaczynski.

Was there romance? Yes. It didn't overshadow the story IMO. But there was definitely a romance.

There were some unexpected twists at the end of the story that impressed me. I really was not expecting the book to end that way. I was a bit disappointed with how much of the story took place on earth vs outer space.

Overall, this was an interesting YA science fiction novel. I think that the ending was strong and the book left off in a very interesting place. I am interested to see what happens next in the sequel.

Thanks to edelweiss and HarperTeen for allowing me to read this book.",1522108800,3
8174,51,16,"Fantastic book. Anyone who knows anything about this book knows its timely. Starr is a 16 year old  black girl from the projects who sees her friend getting shot for no reason at all. The story explores how that effects her, her friends, her family and her relationships. It explores police brutality and race relations and #blacklivesmatter. Its an important book.

Its enraging and depressing and sad but also loving and hopeful and hilarious. I was particularly able to relate to the pop tart debate (toasted all the way), the mother who loves candy crush, and the fact that when there are 2 black people in a school its assumed their dating (in my case it was 2 people with walkers). I could go on and on but really just read it and then make others read it.",1522108800,5
8175,185,1957,"What a difference a good book makes should be the subtitle of this book! Actually it was better than good, it was amazing. Can I just sing that? A MaaaZingg!

I absolutely love when a book makes me laugh. I can recall three separate times that I cracked up. I had to re-read it a few times until I got the giggles out. I just love connecting with a book like that.

As a retired preschool teacher I really related to the heroine, Mari with an iit rhymes with starry. I respected how she developed a trusting relationship with the heros children, Michel and Adele. For nine year old twins they were a handful. Mari demonstrated developmentally appropriate, hands-on, child process oriented art and engaged open-ended interaction. Its no wonder the children responded to her the way they did. She treated them with respect yet held them accountable for their actions. She set boundaries and expectations with appropriate consequences and was consistent and gave love with positive reinforcement. Yes, I noticed and applaud all that accurate child development detail in a romance book! If I was looking for a governess for my children then Id consider myself lucky to have her in my employment. Mari wasn't the only well-developed character is this story.

I had the opportunity to bond with the hero as well. Edgar Rochester, Duke of Banksford was a man in need of being rescued and it obviously had to be Mari or myself but unfortunately I cant be transported into the plot. Life is so unfair. At least I got to live it through Mari. Edgar was intelligent, kind and just made me smile. He was a tad stubborn but what hero isnt? Its part of their charm. It makes the reading much more pleasurable when they realize they are being stubborn and give in.

Who doesnt grow fond of children? Okay, not everyone, but I do. Michel and Adele were adorable. After all they went through, it was heartwarming to see them in a thriving home thanks to Mari, Edgar and his entire staff. I cant leave out Edgars sister, India when mentioning well developed characters. She was hilarious. I was happy to see that she is going to have a book of her own.

Of course there were a couple of characters that made me clench my fists such as Edgars mother and Mrs. Trilby. Ooooh, if I could get my hands on them. Id teach them a thing or two about being nice. However, youll have to read how they turned out.

The plot was brilliant and honestly, refreshing. It flowed smoothly with unexpected thread plots. There is more to this story than what the synopsis says. Theres a plot twist involving Mari that is quite captivating.

The writing style as well as the plot and cast of characters is really what made the book amazing. I thought it was a unique writing style to incorporate proverbs within Maris conversations. It was truly entertaining. I am compelled to share with other readers that this is the first time when Ive finished a novel that I Googled something that was mentioned in the story. I was intrigued with the plot regarding fire brigades and how they chose which fire to put out based on which insurance that property had. I didn't know about that history nor about the steam fire engine that was invented. If you don't know about both subjects then Id Google those two things prior to reading this book, but it certainly isn't necessary. The author did an exceptional job explaining it. I was more curious if it was factual.

The icing on the cake for me was the epilogue. I LOVED it. This was my first Lenora Bell novel and it won't be my last. Ill be looking for Indias story, For the Dukes Eyes Only coming out in October 2018! Until then I definitely recommend reading What a difference a Duke Makes! Its captivating, sexy and a heartstring tugger.

8177,69,1959,"Jacqueline Winspear's father inspired her latest Maisie Dobbs novel, ""To Die But Once.""  The story opens in Hampshire, England, in 1940. British citizen are anxious about their sons who have already enlisted, and dread a possible invasion by the Germans.  The prologue focuses on fifteen-year-old Jimmy Coombes.  He and his fellow workers paint surfaces in airfields using a special flame retardant substance, but the emulsion induces terrible headaches. When Jimmy is found dead, Maisie Dobbs, a psychologist and investigator who is cool under pressure, reassuring, compassionate, and insightful, launches her own inquiry. She senses that the authorities are not inclined to dig deeply for answers.

Maisie has close friends, including her assistant, Billy Beale, and her best pal, Priscilla Partridge, who are both sick with worry, fearing that their children will come to harm while serving their country.  Having suffered grievous losses and trauma during and after the First World War, Maisie empathizes with anyone whose loved ones are at risk.  She has connections with influential people, is unafraid to speak her mind (albeit tactfully), and perseveres when she believes she is on the right track.  With Billy's help and a great deal of effort on her part, Maisie discovers that certain individuals are up to no good, and unless someone stops her, she is determined to bring them to justice.

As she has so many times before, Winspear describes atmosphere, setting, character, and mood authentically and poignantly.  She also conveys the British citizenry's desperate hope that this conflict will not be as devastating as the previous one. ""To Die But Once"" is a solid work of historical fiction that captures the terror of adolescent boys forced to grow up too soon, and the foreboding that their families feel while awaiting word of their fate. The ending is a bit too tidy, and Maisie could use a romantic distraction, but ""To Die But Once"" is another worthy entry in this generally outstanding series.",1522108800,5

What is there left to say about this classic? This is my second read of this novel. First time I have read it in the early 90s. I think I liked it first time more than this time. I have decided to reread this to see what I think of it now and also because I want to watch the fantastic mini-series.

Unlike many other classics, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is easy to read. The old English language and terms are not too many here so it makes it a delightful reading. Characters are well written with each having its own identity. My favorite character in this novel remains Mrs. Bennet. I think she is very funny and hilarious not in an intended way.

Honestly what bothered me was this particular edition of the book. I bought it because the cover looked good but it is not a reader-friendly. It is more like a mass-market paperback which I really dislike. holding it and going through pages was not as comfortable as reading a hardcover book or a normal paperback one.",1522108800,4

Amber Reynolds wakes up to find that shes not exactly awake. She can hear people in the room with her, but she cant see or speak. From listening to the conversations around her, Amber learns that she was involved in some type of accident around Christmas and is now in the hospital, in a coma.

Ambers visitors include her husbandwhom Amber is convinced doesn't love her anymoreand Ambers sister Claire, about whom Amber is having conflicting feelings.

As Amber struggles to remember the events leading up to her accident, the story switches between present and past and delves into childhood diaries from twenty years prior.

I hadnt read this in FOR-EV-ER, so I listened to the audiobook for a little brush up before the movie and Im so glad I did! There was soooooooo much I didn't remember (like, the entire thing) and I have a new appreciation for this book that I didn't have before as a kid.

~| THE GOOD |~
First of all, I absolutely LOVED Hope Daviss performance in this audiobook and she did an amazing job bringing these characters to life. Each character had a distinct voice that fit perfectly with their personality and she even did a great job with all of the odd fantastical things like Mrs. Whichs unusual speaking voice.

Its so interesting reading something as a child and then reading it again as an adult, and I won't lie, a large part of why I loved this is simply because of nostalgia. But when I was younger, I simply took this all at face value. This was just a fun story of three friends on a crazy planet that want to save their father. Now its easy for me to see beyond that and read the deeper meaning that I couldn't before. LEngle was making a statement about the world, about humanity, and pouring in her hope for future generations.

I can definitely understand why this book wouldnt be for everyone. I mean, if I went into detail about what happens in this book, I would straight up sound insane. To give you a better idea of what I mean, Meg and her friends end up on another planet that has nice aliens on it and she starts calling one Aunt Beast. The words lovingly and tentacles are used in the same sentence more than once to describe these aliens. Is this book trippy as all get out?? Oh yeah, but thats kind of the magic of it. Kids don't see the weird stuffthey see the love, the fun, and the hope.

Legitimately have no freaking idea how this going to made into a movie, but OBVIOUSLY I'm here for space Oprah.

~| THE UGLY |~
The only real problem I had with this book is hard to put into words. There were a few minor moments that felt kind of old-fashioned in their ideas?? Nothing that bad was said or done, but it was enough to make me feel uncomfortable??? That word seems a bit strong, but its something I definitely noticed. An example is when the kids are first learning about Mrs. Whatsit. They don't know who she is yet and think shes a homeless drifter thats passing through the town. I think the phrase Meg uses to describe her is neighborhood tramp (tramp meaning vagabond) and her thoughts about this homeless person are so negative, it shook me up a little. Especially because Meg was JUST complaining about how shes not accepted by her peers.

I don't know, its nothing really major and didn't effect my overall love of the book, but it felt worth mentioning.

~| FINAL WORD |~
This was, and still is, one of my favorite books and age hasn't changed that at all. I have no idea how this crazy story will be made into a movie, but I absolutely love this book and its message of love.",1522195200,5
8184,763,717,"Assassins Fate by Robin Hobb is, first and foremost, a book about closure. But as much as it is about endings, its also about new beginnings. Really, its the perfect sendoff for a character that is much beloved and one which many of us have spent countless pages journeying along with. Assassins Fate is the third and final book in The Fitz and the Fool Trilogy, but it is also the final book (for now, anyway) in the Farseer books as a whole. Hobb has created such a rich world, full of so many memorable, engaging characters, though, that I could easily see additional books coming from her set in the various worlds of the Six Duchies, Rain Wilds, or Kelsingra. Speaking of all of those places, Assassins Fate is worthy of a Marvel film in that it intertwines the various worlds Hobb has concocted and spent entire series delving into by giving us the penultimate crossover as Fitz comes face to face with many of the characters from both the Liveship Traders books and the Rain Wild Chronicles. It really is a treat to see all of these disparate worlds come together into a seamless whole. Ill admit I felt a bit of a thrill when Fitz revisits the map room in Kelsingra, the very same room he visited all those many years (and books) ago when he and Chade first began experimenting with the Skillstones.

Unlike the previous two books in this series, Im giving Assassins Fate a solid five rockets. The reason previous installments fell short was because there were just too many pages where nothing significant happens. Not so with this final book. This one is full of plot moving material as we pick up right where Fools Quest left off. Fitz has healed a number of Kelsingras residents whose dragon initiated changes have done more harm than good. This is applauded by the Kelsingrans, but not so much by the dragons, who threaten Fitzs life for interfering with the changes they have made in their keepers. Fitz escapes this harrowing predicament unscathed, for he must continue his quest for vengeance against those who killed his daughter, Bee. Of course, Bee is not actually dead, a fact Fitz eventually comes to know.

Speaking of Bee Shes a character I did not like much in the first two books. Shes a bit of an oddity most of the time and, when she isn't off doing her own thing, shes a distraction to Fitzs story. But in Assassins Fate she really comes into her own, seizing her place in the world as it were, as she flies into a final confrontation with her abductors. Looking back at the whole, I found her story arc refreshing. Shes admittedly very dependent early on, but when it comes time for her to stand up for herself, she does so admirably well.

Discussing the ending of Assassins Fate is tough because I don't want to give anything away. Ill say only this: Hobb concludes the series and the story of FitzChivalry Farseer in the only way she could. Its a marvelous ending for a character youve hopefully grown to love as much as I have. Yes, Fitz can be frustrating beyond belief at times, stupid at others, and selfless past the point of heartbreak, but hes also a man of duty and honor (in the way of an assassin, at least) and possesses a stubbornness that knows no bounds. If this book is truly his farewell, then I say Hobb gave him the royal treatment. The road getting there was harrowing, suspenseful, horrible, and wonderful, but completely worth it from a readers perspective when you can look back at everything he accomplished.

It should come as no surprise that I feel Assassins Fate should be on every fantasy readers reading list. Do yourself a favor and start with the first book in the overarching series, the first book in The Farseer Trilogy, Assassins Apprentice. The journey will be well worth every page.",1522195200,5

Set in Britain during the early days of World War II, the story concerns Maisie's quest to find out how the son of a local pub owner died while working for a contractor.

8189,338,1613,"This was a fascinating book, but at times hard to get through. It's very dense with a lot of detail--most of the time.  However, there were some gaps in it which left me with questions. (More on that later.) It was also hard to read about the terrible crimes and I had to stop for a day or so between chapters to recover--particularly as I'm a woman and most of the crimes were against women.  But I did finish it and found it very enlightening, and also depressing to think that there are so many human monsters out there. It bothers me that the Green River Killer case was never solved and the murderer could still be out there. It wasn't a perfect book and some things detracted from it.  First of all, there were punctuation mistakes, such as numerous missing quotation marks and commas where there should have been periods, and vice versa.  I don't know if this was in the original manuscript and the editors missed it, or it was a formatting error in the Kindle version.  Secondly, there were holes in Mr. Douglas' explanation of profiles and solution to cases.  One example is that his profile said a certain killer didn't get along with women, was a loner, etc.  However, this murderer was married with a daughter.  The author never explained this discrepancy when the killer was arrested.  Another example was how did a man kill his wife when he was supposed out with his son the whole time? This was never explained. Did the murderer give his son a sleeping pill and let him sleep in the car while the murderer killed his wife? Or did he drop the son off with a relative or a babysitter so he could kill the wife? So there were some niggling questions for me which were never answered.",1522195200,4

8191,518,1952,"Peter Schweizer's new book, SECRET EMPIRES, is an excellent read and well worth picking up prior to the 2018 elections. Schweizer, author of Extortion, Clinton Cash, and numerous other books focusing on the corruptions of the governing class, here zeroes in on the predations of intra-familial nepotism. Children, parents, in-laws and ""close family friends,"" while staying just within the bounds of federal law, receive many opportunities for advancement and enrichment simply due to having a well-placed Senator or Congressperson, Governor or Mayor in the family. Here are a few of the case studies in this book:

I was surprised and hurt to learn that regular-guy Joe Biden's son Hunter has parlayed himself into lucrative contracts with Chinese state-owned firms. Before Senator Mitch McConnell married Elaine Chao, he was a hard-liner on trade with China. Now, not so much.  Imagine: the  Senate majority leader married to a woman with strong ties to Chinese government industry and currently secretary of Transportation.

Of course, my own Chicago is no stranger to corruption and ""clout."" Friends of Barack Obama's have been known to indulge in what Schweizer calls ""smash and grab,"" as when the former president severely talked down the price of coal-mining stocks only to have friends, showing more hypocrisy than good citizenship, snapped up the stocks cheap. Guess what happened to the price of those stocks afterward?

Illinois' next governor is bound to be a plutocrat; either the incumbent, very rich Republican Bruce Rauner, will stay in, or his challenger, even richer real estate mogul Democrat J.B. Pritzker, will win the office. Prizker's niece, hotelier Penny Pritzker, forms an interesting ""power couple"" with her uncle, and another noteworthy example of keeping it ""in the family."" The last chapter in this book -- with conflicts galore and room to grow -- is called ""The Trump Princelings.""

The sooner people read this timely book and demand meaningful reform, the better.",1522195200,5
8192,128,1957,"""It was a desperate gamble. It was also her best hope at the moment.""

FINAL DECISION: I was disappointed in this one as the hero didn't seem heroic to me but rather a milquetoast who was dominated and dictated to by the heroine.

THE STORY: Mari Perkins is desperate when she arrives in London, has her baggage stolen and is late for an appointment with her agency. Rather than getting the governess position she was promised, she is turned away. Mari, however, is never going back to the orphanage where she was raised and worked. Instead, she overhears the resignation of the governess of a duke and decides to appear as the replacement. Edgar Rochester, Duke of Banksford, is not the typical duke. To the despair of his mother, he is engaged in trade in order to save the family fortunes. He has also just been presented with two illegitimate children who keep scaring off the governesses he hires for them. What he needs is a strong, scary governess, and the sweet, innocent optimistic Mari is definitely not what is required.

OPINION: This book disappointed me. I was interested in the premise and I have really enjoyed the authors previous books. And while I liked the strength and independence of the heroine, the hero was weak and uninteresting. The book suffers from too much modern concerns and sensibilities for a historical novel.

Mari is a woman looking for her past and trying to build a future for herself. She is clever and kind. While I understand trying to make unique characters, Mari feel entirely too modern a character to me. If her character had been transported into a modern book, she would be entirely comfortable in a contemporary novel as a nanny. Her sexual aggression for an innocent period woman raised in an orphanage just feels completely out of place. While I am not a reader who looks for historical accuracy in her books, this book just felt too modern for the time period and the characters did not fit and nothing else about the story was good enough to distract me from those facts.

The biggest problem with this book for me was the hero. First, he doesn't feel possible as a historical character. He is given a tragic background, but it felt forced and not really impacting his life except to give him two illegitimate children which we are supposed to believe that everyone around him accept as reasonable that he would be raising in his own home. Nothing about Edgar works together or feels organic. Perhaps there are too many issues for him: a duke who rejected his rank, a man betrayed by the older woman he loved but who might have used him, a scientist, a tradesman, a new father trying to have a relationship with his children. Just too many parts that don't mesh well together. Then there is all the moralizing over his concerns about abusing his relationship with Mari who is his employee. This feels like it is taken from a modern manual of how to deal with subordinates. Mari ends up making all the moves in their relationship. Having the woman take control can be sexy but just feels forced here. The combination of all these things makes Edgar a weak character that I would bet is totally controlled by his wife in the future. There is nothing of his ""hero"" that feels like a man that deserves to be a hero. And nothing about his character that interested me.

There is just too much going on with not enough interest on my part. There is also the story of Mari's parentage which feels like a predictable afterthought designed to at least make her relationship with Edgar reasonable in the end.

WORTH MENTIONING: Now the story of India and Ravenwood sounds really intriguing and is probably the best part of this book.

8193,734,1954,"HURTS TO LOVE YOU is a book with a four-star ending dragged down by a three-star first half.

After the first two books in the Forbidden Hearts series I expected to be just blown away by this final book but sadly Eve and Gabe took a long time to warm up to. I don't exactly know where the disconnect was but after all the intensity for the first two couples, I felt none of that this time around. Eve's journey and growth over the course of the book was totally satisfying but considering how much I liked Gabe as a peripheral character in the previous books, in his own book I.. didn't like him? Like, much at all? Ever? Or maybe it's less that I didn't like him and more that I didn't feel anything for him.

While I wouldn't say the twist, or hook, to book three was obvious right from the get-go.. it does get easier to pick up the clues as the story goes on. And it isn't until that moment that I felt the book hit it's stride. We had confrontations, confusions, and finally a little bit of chemistry. But nowhere near enough for what I'd come to expect from Rai's books.

That being said, I love the overall family dynamic of these books : complicated and crazy-messy though they are, I thought this was a solid wrap-up of all the loose threads. But like any family there are the less than awesome parts -- oh Nicholas you annoyed me sooo much in this book, though part of me can appreciate the fact that just because a hero gets his HEA does not mean he's suddenly perfect or done learning or growing, so, yay..? Ugh. I still teared up a bit throughout some of the exchanges though.

I would absolutely still recommend this series, despite the fact that this final installment didn't live up to my expectations, because books one & two are so good and there is still a lot to love in HURTS TO LOVE YOU. Rai's writing is so smart and insightful and I'm looking forward to what comes next for this author.",1522195200,3

8195,317,1948,"THE FEAR by C.L. Taylor is a flawless novel that sucks you in from the very first line and holds you captive until the very end.

Lou Wandsworth may be thirty-two, living it up in London with a good job and plenty of friends and lovers, but beneath the surface, Lou is haunted by what happened to her as a fourteen-year-old girl when she was groomed by her karate teacher and taken to France under false pretences. Mike Hughes shattered her soul all those years ago and she has never really been able to piece herself back together again as she pushes away one decent guy after another. But with her deceased father's home needing to be handled, Lou finds it a good time to return to her hometown and confront the man who took so much from her. But as soon as Lou arrives back, she realises with horror that Mike hasn't changed at all and has lined up another young girl to seduce and destroy, but this time Lou is determined to stop him, no matter what ...

The topic of grooming is so horrific and, as a mother, is one I usually can't stomach reading about but as I am a huge fan of C.L. Taylor I knew I had to read THE FEAR which will really open up your eyes to how something so vile can happen - every parent should read this story!

The character of Lou is so inspiring as she confronts the past and refuses to be silenced, and my heart broke for the child that she was and the child that Chloe is. Wendy was a harder nut to crack but as the story progressed, we get to see the damaged woman beneath the anger and she has a strength all of her own too.

Through throwbacks and the tense drama of the present day, we get to see the entire picture unfold and as Lou finds herself in danger once again, the tense atmosphere will really overpower you as you become sick with worry for Lou and Chloe.

Dark, haunting, and brimming with bravery, THE FEAR by C.L. Taylor is another excellent portrayal of the evil side of human nature and boy that ending really packed a punch. If you read crime fiction then C.L. Taylor needs to be at the top of your list.

My first read was a sheer feat of determination:  I was eleven, and it was a huge book.  And an adult book.  I felt like a rock star.

The second time, I fell in love with the story.  The richness of the world Margaret Mitchell presents is astounding.

The third time, I fell in love with Scarlett.  Scarlett is the immense character of spirit and soul, with an unbreakable determination and strength.  I envied her strong shoulders for bearing the burdens she did, and her ability to say ""Fiddle-dee-dee!"" and not care what others thought.

This time, I've fallen in love with Melanie Wilkes.

Melly has been on my radar since the beginning, but like Scarlett, I haven't always had the patience for her slow, deliberate actions and selfless heart.  As I get older and smarter, I have learned to appreciate this silently strong character.  Where Scarlett will trod over anyone she must to rise to the top, Melly stands resolute behind all the other characters, both a sanctuary and a rock.  She is graceful and poised.  Most of all, her kindness stands out.  Strangely, this is an uncommon characteristic in literature, but it makes Melanie all the more bright.

As long and grueling as it is, Gone With the Wind remains vehemently one of my favorite books.  From the richness of the story to the depth and growth of the characters, I find myself drawn into the Old South.  Margaret Mitchell effortlessly paints different shades of Georgia - from the grand plantations to Yankee-occupied Atlanta.  You can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell every aspect of this novel and every book should have this incredible balance of description and experience.

As I've mentioned, the characters are fantastic.  There are parts of Rhett and Scarlett that, four reads in, I'm still not certain about.  One of the most popular post-reading questions about this book is: ""Do you think Rhett and Scarlett will make amends?"" and I love this question, because I don't know.  The more I read it, the more I think that the best they can ever hope for is a struggling friendship but... ah... anyway, if you've read Gone With the Wind I'd love to hear your opinion on this.

I understand and acknowledge the problematic scenes where POC characters are portrayed in a stereotyped manner and slavery is longed for... I try to be mindful that Gone With the Wind was written in 1936 and the world has grown smarter, more respectful, and more accountable.  Characters like Prissy and Big Sam are unfairly characterized especially.  That said, I would fully recommend reading this book despite these portrayals, but knowing they are there and that they are problematic.

In short, this book is a classic for a reason.  It is beautifully written, the characters are relatable even almost ninety years later, and I love it.  Three good reasons for you to give Gone With the Wind a try.

Intimidated by the size?  No problem.  The Recorded Books version read by Linda Stephens (this one!) is fabulous.",1522281600,5

8202,1088,1920,"If you know me, you know I am NOT the biggest fans of novels in verse. In fact, I do my best to stay away from them! (Hence the reason I can count on two hands how many I've reviewed on the blog haha) But then sometimes a book like The Poet X comes along and makes me want to change my mind about them.....

  A girl and her mother see differently on something very important: her mother's religion. Her mother wants to keep her hidden away and quiet, but Xiomara has so much to say that she can't keep it contained. She discovers slam poetry and a whole new escape plan opens up for her.

  Although I'm not a fan of novels in verse, the storytelling and writing style in this one was phenomenal. I'm always amazed when I can get a complete story just by reading a book of poems. I know that doesn't make much sense, but it seems as if it should be so much harder to put together a story without making it seem choppy when you write it in poem style. And Acevedo did just that.

  I also really loved Xiormara's character. She was a strong female character that I was glad to read about during Women's History Month. She didn't take crap from anyone and I loved how she was able to beat up anyone, no matter who they were. It made me feel empowered just from reading her story. Lastly, I really loved that Acevedo made her curvy and beautiful. It's not something that we see enough in books.

  I also really liked the real life aspect of religion. It made me a bit uncomfortable because I'm Catholic and alot of those things that came up in her life, once came up in mine. It felt like I was reading about my own life at some points. It was a little different because she's Dominican, but lawd if some things didn't line up. Her mom was the equivalent to my grandmother, and I could feel her agreeing with her from Heaven lol I hope teens (and anyone else who reads this) all feel a connection like this when they read it!

  I'm someone who still doesn't care for many novels in verse, but novels like this one and Long Way Down by Jason Reynolds are determined to make me change my mind about them. Finding more like these two would most definitely make me have a change of heart and read more.",1522281600,5

Of course, the Duke and the governess are attracted to each other despite the differences in their stations.
This is a pretty familiar trope in historical romances, but Ms. Bell has a fresh writing and witty style that makes this book a very enjoyable read. If you are a reader who likes their historicals to be accurate to the period, this isn't for you, but the characters are engaging, the story has some twists, and the h/h are a sweet couple. The children are adorable also without being real brats.

Whoa that ending!! I just finished this book less than an hour ago so I am still reeling a bit from the ending, but I am going to (hopefully) put my thoughts together coherently enough to write this review!

I re-read the series in anticipation for starting Restore Me, and although I am happy I did because it helped me remember everything that had happened, it was a little hard at first to go from such a high in Ignite Me to all of a sudden intense emotions straight off the bat in Restore Me. However, like always with this series it was really easy to just speed through this book so it never slowed me down.

The writing is beautiful. I love Tahereh Mafi's writing style so much especially when it comes to these characters. Despite the wide cast of characters, most of them have their own individuality and I feel like I know each character really well. I think I brought this up in a review for one of the other books in this series, but besides the Harry Potter series, I highlight and take notes in these books more than I do any other books. From the beautifully poetic writing to the conversations between the characters I find myself needing to tab my favorite parts. Granted, it's easier on my kindle, but I still found myself highlighting large areas.

The characters were almost exactly how I hoped they'd be. I loved Kenji, who is once again my favorite character. He got bumped down the last book because of how much I loved Juliette, but after some stuff with her in this book (no spoilers!) Kenji has been bumped back up to my favorite. I loved his moments with Juliette and especially his moments with Warner. I think the way he has become such an integral part of their lives is something I wasn't sure how it would work but now that I see it unfolding in front of me it's all I've wanted. Juliette unfortunately was my biggest problem with this book, which really pains me to say because I loved her character development throughout the original three books. However, the Juliette at the end of Ignite Me is not the same Juliette in Restore Me, despite only it being two weeks between each book in the story. I absolutely expected Juliette to be a bit insecure when it came to being the Supreme Commander of North America. I knew she was going to kind of learn the ropes and she'd be a bit unsure of herself. But I also thought she would be the Juliette we knew from the end of Ignite Me. And she wasn't. She reminded me of the Juliette we knew in beginning and middle of Unravel Me. She was this scared, emotional, irrational girl. I felt like we took multiple steps back in her development without much of an explanation. I am hoping this changes, but I am bummed about it because it felt unnecessary and outside of her character. Talking outside of character, Warner was super different but in ways I not only expected but I liked being in his point of view. I think Warner's reaction to everything he had been through, everything he found out about his life, was very realistic. We also get anxiety representation that I was surprised at how much I related to Warner's anxiety and panic attacks. I really enjoyed not only getting more of Warner's past but also getting inside his head. I was hoping we'd get more with him and Adam (and James) but I bet that'll happen later on. I did enjoy the new cast of characters we were presented with. I think Juliette's friendship with Nazeera is one I am so excited to see more in the future. I have wanted Juliette to have a female friendship for so long now. I cannot wait to get to know the other characters we have only had small snippets of.

Although I was never bored while reading, I did expect there to be more action in this book. Or at least less of Juliette driving me nuts and getting to know our new characters more. I don't think I expected a crazy amount of action because it's been four years since the last book so it's almost like we need to re-introduced.  But I think we could have had more. If not action, maybe just world building? That is one of my biggest negatives about the original three, I want more of the world. And although we meet characters from other parts of the world, they're barely in the story so it isn't as much as I'd like. Like I have already said, I wish we had less of Juliette regressing into her old self and more progress with how our cast of characters are going to try to make North America and the world a better place.

Things I am hoping we will get in the future: Warner talking with Adam and James more, possibly more Adam character development?, more world building, and getting to know our new characters more.

Overall I cannot wait for the next book. I am not sure how I will wait a whole year (I assume) for another book but I definitely plan on re-reading this in the future. I am so happy I have been able to fall in love with this series even more and that we get more of these characters, writing, and world.",1522281600,4
8206,749,1069,"cw: menstruation, explicit sexual content, demonic possession, homophobic slurs

I think this is the first audiobook Ive ever listened to in its entirety! I was doing busywork at my job and had run out of new podcast eps (which never happens to me!), so I sorted my TBR by random and went through until I found a book that a) had an audiobook format, b) was available to listen to now through my library, and c) had a narrator whose voice I liked. Usually its a struggle to find something that fits all three of these, but A Head Full of Ghosts nailed it!

This was such a compelling read and I will probably end up purchasing a physical copy later on to re-read. The narrator, Joy Osmanski, did a phenomenal job and I felt pulled right into the story. The point-of-view is that of an adult reflecting on her experiences as a young child. I thought this was really well-done, because we get a really innocent perspective that realistically contains more mature insights. It also switches a lot between past and present in a way that I think really worked with the story.

I was a bit anxious starting this out, because it explicitly states in the blurb that the MCs older sister is displaying symptoms of schizophrenia. While I cant speak directly to the rep (which may not be great, especially considering some stuff that goes on toward at the end that I cant discuss without spoilers), I do want to address the concern that this links mental illness and demonic possessions. Because it doesnt. I thought it was clear as a reader that this was a commentary on the danger of ignoring science in favor of superstition. To me, the implication was that, had Marjories experience been treated seriously and as a medical concern, things would have turned out a lot differently for the Barrett family.

While this certainly had its spooky bits and while I would probably file it under the horror genre, it wasn't outright scary, so if you're easily frightened (like me) you could still enjoy this! There were some unsettling graphic bits (both involving gore and sexual content), so Id pass on this if you want to avoid anything of that nature. But overall, I think this is a book that horror lovers (particularly those who like to deconstruct the genre) will enjoy and I recommend it highly.",1522281600,5
8207,252,1933,"I am an unabashed fan of Jesse Ball. Ive read many of his books  The Curfew, The Lesson, Silence Once Begun, A Cure for Suicide, How to Set a Fire & Why  and have often marveled at his metafictional, fablelike, and sometimes provocative works.

But this time its personal  for the author and perhaps for this reader, too. Jesse Ball dedicates the book to his deceased brother, Abram Ball, who had Down Syndrome, and in the prologue, writes about the struggle to create this book and how he solved it: I would make a book that was hollow. I would place him in the middle of it, and write around him for the most part. He would be there in his effect.  Like Jesse Ball, I have a loved one  a young nephew  with Down Syndrome and I was curious to see how he would develop this concept.

This is how: an ill widower, a doctor, takes on the role of census taker and sets off with his Down Syndrome son to take the census, from point A to point Z. Each census taker must forego his or her rights of protection. Consider the census as a large instrument made up of living cellsand each cell is a census taker.  Yet half way through the book, the unnamed narrator develops a new method of the census  not gathering certain information but instead, deciding what information to look for. The journey into less urban, more unplanned areas is a metaphor for the fathers own journey into the edges of where life and death convene.

To that end, Census becomes a tapestry of representation  who will stand up and be counted. Indeed, father and son are discovering the heart and soul of America  the kindness, the anger, the humanity, the fear, the gentleness, the ignorance, and the brutality. Each person who participates in this census must allow the census taker to leave a tattooed mark. And indeed, the mark may well be a reminder of how they reacted to life and treated a boy who was not viewed by them as part of the norm.

The conceit is not quite as accessible than Mr. Balls previous works and if truth be known, there were times when I wondered what Mr. Ball was trying to tell meand found myself admiring the book more than loving it. But the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and by the end of the book, I believed I knew. He was writing about the inevitability of saying goodbye and of being part of a world that demands we deal with the good and the bad.",1522281600,4
8208,666,569,"First, I have to start off by saying this is the third book in a series. So although I will not be spoiling anything that happens in this book I may talk about some minor things that happen in previous books. Nothing too spoiler-y but it is inevitable and I cannot review the book without bringing up some stuff. It's mostly who the main character ends up with in the end. So if that is something that'll bother you, just know this book series is amazing and you should read it.

This is such a great ending (at least, so we thought at the time it released) to an amazing trilogy.  I genuinely feel like the books get better with each one. I originally read this trilogy in college, and I am not sure if it's because I had so much on my mind at the time or if it's because my mental health is not what it used to be, but I really connected with Juliette's story arc. I also realized I remembered almost nothing about the plot of this story, so most of this re-read felt brand new.

I love the cast of characters in this book. Juliette is one of my favorite fictional woman characters because she has been through so much but she comes out so strong in the end. And it's a hard but natural process where by this book her character has completely evolved into this badass woman who will do what she has to in order to not only protect the ones she loves but also herself. In a lot of young adult dystopian books, especially with female protagonists, the main character will not hold a lot of value on their life. But a Juliette states, she plans on living after this war. Granted, I do think that she would easily die for the ones she loves, she doesn't plan on anyone dying. And I love her for it. I also love Warner's character arc. It's funny because in my review for the first book, Shatter Me, I couldn't fully understand everyone's love for the guy. But now I get it. I love the way he treats Juliette, but also the way he craves love (romantically, platonically, and familial) despite his cold front he puts on. I love the way their relationship forms. The building of their relationships, the conflicts they have, and the respect they hold for each other feels incredibly natural. Kenji is still one of my favorite characters, but I think this book alone Juliette has taken my spot as favorite. However, Kenji's moments of friendship with Juliette are absolutely amazing. It's so cute and I found myself either giggling constantly or sobbing when they had their moments. Adam was of course, kind of the worst, and he gets even worse in this book. But that is not an unpopular opinion.

The writing improves with each book, and that's saying something because I really love Tahereh Mafi's writing in Shatter Me. I think as the world expands and we get to see the fuller picture of everything happening we also get to see more of Mafi's talents. Which makes me even more excited to start Restore Me. I don't think I have highlighted and typed up notes (they're on my kindle) in any book (or really any series other than Harry Potter) more than I have for Ignite Me. There are so many beautiful, hilarious, and heartbreaking moments that had me going through a whole range of emotions. Although I do not typically go towards dystopian reads as much as I used to, this book is more than that. It's about self love, finding the value in yourself, forgiveness, grief, friendship, etc.

This book is my favorite one out of the three but especially when it comes to the plot because it had me a bit of a mess. I was hooked into the story and I needed to know what was going to happen next. The action was intense, the characters coming together to form this badass team was amazing, and I think the way everything came together was exactly what I wanted. It is one of those endings where you're satisfied, but also you want more. I cannot believe we have a new book in this series. I cannot believe it's on my kindle just waiting for me to start reading (which I'll be doing, the moment this review is up).

I cannot recommend this series enough. I do think that it's the kind of series where as the story builds and evolves the more invested you get in the characters and plot. I could understand why people weren't a fan of the first one and stopped but at the same time I think Ignite Me is worth getting to because it's beautifully done.  Please, let's talk about this book series in the comments if you've read it.",1522281600,5

It got thrown in the ""trash"" pile with Peter Rabbit... another childhood book with hideously boring illustrations I never took to.  I don't think I ever got beyond the title, lol (is this why toilet paper commercials often feature bears?)

Checking it out as an adult for a classics book club... I don't feel any better about it.  What a snoozer!  I appreciate seeing the complete stories and illustrations together as it was originally published in the 1920s.  It's cute that Christopher Robin looks like a girl, ha ha.  I don't remember the songs in it as a child-- I guess cuz it wasn't a favorite, but I can see how that add-in is a winning element for kids.  Obviously, I'm in the minority in disliking it, lol... oh well.  I did enjoy watching its origin story recently (Goodbye Christopher Robin) and found that tons more interesting.

8213,436,225,"Title: Glass Sword

Author: Victoria Aveyard

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Dystopian Fiction

Series: Red Queen, book two

Star Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

Red Queen was a sleeper hit, a blockbuster that I was curious about since before it had come out. Unable to resist any longer, I checked it out from my local library, and I was captivated. As soon as I had an opening in my library stack, I checked out Glass Sword. It had one last renewal on it, so I pushed it to the top of the stack, excited and apprehensive all at once. As soon as I was finished with The Queens Rising, I picked this up and began, diving into Mares world once again. As far as sequels go, Glass Sword wasn't a bad one; it tied up loose ends, introduced new characters and brought back familiar ones, was full of action, political intrigue, and rich, exciting character development. The ending was shocking and explosive, and Im so upset that Kings Cage isn't in at the library yet!

Glass Sword picks up where Red Queen left off, with Mare on the run from the queen and Maven, the crown prince who desires ultimate power and something elseMare for his own, no matter the cost. Forced into the uncomfortable position of reluctant revolutionary, she sets forth across the countries to find people like her, people with Red and Silver blood both, in hopes of stopping the bloodshed and taking the crown from the man she once trusted most. With Cal, the misplaced prince, by her side, Mare must decide what more she is willing to sacrifice for justice and freedom, even if the price is her soul and sanity

I really, really liked this book; I was having some serious sequel anxiety when I began. It took several minutes for me to figure out what was going on, because it had been some time since reading Red Queen, but once things got rolling, Glass Sword had me in its grip and didn't let go, not even after the last, horrible moment. I just finished it yesterday, and Im still reeling. The pacing was breakneck, and the prose spare but powerful. I was captivated by the second installment in this series; Im absolutely invested now. There was a lot of continuity that I liked, there were a lot of topics that were explored more fully in this book. The character development, though, was the star of this novel; Mares transformation from a poor, nondescript Red to the head of a revolution, and Cals transition from the main heir to the crown to the runaway who must come to terms with the fact that he will have to fight for the crown, against a person who knows him so well that he can predict all of his moves. I also really enjoyed the new characters that were introduced; Im both relieved and upset that King Cage isn't here yet, because obviously I need a break after all of that intensity. All I know is, Im in for the long haul now. Im so excited for Kings Cage and War Storm; I cant wait to see whats in store for Mare Barrow! The bottom line: The second book in the bestseller Red Queen series, Glass Sword was a meaty, thrilling, satisfying sequel, and I cant wait for Kings Cage!

I consider myself fairly smart, but I could not find enough pleasure from the book to justify how slow and dry it was.

Who knew that being good at video games would throw her straight in to couch potato hell? Jina Modell works in the Communications department in a secret government organisation. Or at least she used to. Now, after a secret assessment carried out, via video game, she is being thrown in with the one of the GO-Teams, a highly trained military unit, as a drone operator. Her days of 9-5 in a climate controlled office are over. However, Jina is no quitter and no matter what her new team throw at her she is determined to fit into the team. Even if team leader Levi, call sign Ace, doesnt seem to want her around.

I need more romantic suspense in my life, so I decided to pick up The Woman Left Behind, I was hoping to fall in love with some sexy military types and enjoy a fast paced plot. That isn't quite what happened. Although I definitely fell in love with a team of sexy military types, however, I found it was the Jina Babe Modell that kept me hooked to the book. I loved how sassy she was and that she had no quit in her. As for the high octane plotthat was a little lacking. There was only one explosion and a scattering of gunfire in the whole book. However, that didn't mean I didn't enjoy it.

The Woman Left Behind centred mostly around Jinas initiation into the team and her training. She went from an office worker to a fully trained and fighting fit soldier and seeing that journey was funny and a little awe inspiring. What made this book so interesting, despite not having a fast moving plot, was Jina herself. She was easy to identify with as she approached the training regime/physical torture with reluctance, trepidation and the will not to fail. She liked her comfy office job and she had no desire to work outside air conditioning. The humour and camaraderie that this brought was a lot of fun and made this a quick and easy read.

Now the romance part. Levi and Jina have a lot of tension between them. At first, it was dislike and lust but as they got to know one another it was just plain ol lust, which developed to more as the book continued. The tension and chemistry was fantastic, especially as neither of them were able to act on the pull between them. However, I found when the romance did finally come to a head right at the end, after all the build up, it seemed a little anti-climatic. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I thought they had more chemistry when they weren't a couple than when they were.

However, this was a great read, it was very entertaining with a fantastic heroine, a few tense moments and a lot of sexual tension. I now need to go back and read the first book in the series (not essential to read to understand this book) and look forward to the release of the third.",1522454400,4

The story is clever, a classic whodunit, a quick, fun read.

8241,400,191,"Yes, of _course_ it's a re-read.

When I was about eight or ten, I thought this was the very best book in the world. Today, I still think it's pretty darned good. I didn't re-read it directly because of the movie, but because it's being done for my book club; in the meanwhile, it was about time to re-read it anyway.

If you haven't read it, you should. L'Engle plays in the same garden as Gene Wolfe and R.A. Lafferty: the garden where the boundary between science fiction and fantasy dissolves under the influence of the Divine. Not to be misleading: L'Engle is neither as labyrinthine as Wolfe, nor as satirical as Lafferty, nor, come to think of it, does she play her cards as close to the vest as either of them. But this is fitting in a book for young readers; she is about as subtle in her religious symbolism as, say, C.S. Lewis in the _Narnia_ books.

OK, enough namedropping. What's it about?

My daughter summed it up the other day like this: ""Some kids go to space to save the dad of some of them."" Well, and that is a perfect blurb, in that it is completely accurate and completely misleading.

Meg Murray, a brilliant young woman of roughly ten to twelve, is emotionally disturbed because her father, a brilliant scientist, has been missing for about two years. Her mother, also a brilliant scientist (they run in flocks, you know), is sure he will come home and continues to write to him daily.

On a dark and stormy night (yes, the book begins with _that_ line), Meg and her mother are having cocoa in the kitchen with Meg's four-year-old brother, Charles Wallace (who is bloody brilliant but doesn't speak in front of people he doesn't trust), when there is a knock at the door. In comes a weird old woman, Mrs. Whatsit yclept, who clowns a bit and tells Mrs. Murray that ""there _is_ such a thing as a tesseract,"" causing Mrs. M. to go pale.

With their new friend Calvin O'Keefe, Meg and Charles Wallace are taken by Mrs. Whatsit and her friends Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which to the planet Uriel, there to see the evil known as the Dark Thing engulf a planet. This is what Mr. Murray is fighting; this, what shadows the Earth and brings evil. But Earth is only shadowed, and fighting back with great leaders, scientists, and artists leading the way. (This, by the way, is the one time in the book that Jesus is explicitly mentioned.)

The plot accelerates smoothly to the point that it's kind of amazing how much is crammed into the last twenty pages, and never fails to enthrall the reader - at least, _this_ reader.

L'Engle wrote many other books, including (depending on how you count) three, four, or seven sequels to _Wrinkle_. Though I have never failed to enjoy her work, none of it, to my mind, reaches the heights of this one, a life's masterwork.",1522540800,5
8242,778,760,"Jesus Christ, can you think of any one person who has had more influence on two thousand years of history? I think we all know the story  born in a barn, pissed off many important people and ended up nailed to a tree. Christopher Moore has decided that there has to be more to the story. If we could sit down with Christs best bro from his teenage years back in Nazareth, what stories would we learn?

Lamb is pure genius. Lets be honest, we were all stupid teens at one point in time. When you sit back and think about it, people everywhere from every time are more or less the same. Did Napoleon get picked on by the other boys because he needed a stool to get on his horse? Did Abraham Lincoln burn down a lob cabin while farting over an open flame? Was Attila the Hun afraid to kiss a girl? Its fun to imagine what historic people would have been like when they were stupid teens.

This book had me laughing out loud, reading great one-liners and hilarious scenarios to my ever-patient wife, who has not yet forbidden me from speaking to her while she is reading. I loved how Moore created these magical scenes that would develop a theme or flat out statement from the Bible. For me, Lamb had a Forrest Gump appeal to it. Through the comedy, Moore told a heartwarming tale that portrayed the life of Jesus Christ in a whole new perspective. As a reader, I had a window into the events and influences that created the man. Yes, I know that its fiction, but it seemed plausible.

The characters. I just cant say enough about the characters created by Moore. Biff, of course, carries the story. He is the peanut butter to Jesus jelly. Biff allowed us to see Jesus for who he was, a person just like any of us. They argued, farted and had each others backs. They were normal, yet exceptional. Moore didn't neglect any of the other characters. I was able to see many familiar characters in a whole new light. Best of all, was his treatment of Jesus. We got to know the boy who became the man. We saw his struggles, his pain and torment, but we also saw him have fun and learn. There was nothing irreverent about the character.

Lamb might not be for everyone. The close-minded at one end of the spectrum or the other will hate it because they are supposed to. Its fictional hypothesizing, enjoy it for what it is. And thats all I have to say about that.",1522540800,5

What they find in a lost corner of the universe will change all their livesand unearth dangerous secrets. But when a darkness from Anas past returns, she must face an impossible choice: does she protect a kingdom that wants her dead or save the Metal boy she loves?

Ive heard a rumor in St. Petersburg that this book was a journey to the past, a retelling of Anatasia in space. I couldn't contain my excitement and read this as soon as I received it! Once upon a December, or in the dark of the night since this is set in space, a young girl and a robot were found floating in space and they floated their way into my heart throughout this story. But the crew they found themselves with are into the whole Firefly thing so they learn to do it too. Anyways, as a retelling I was really surprised how accurate it stayed to the cartoon and legend of Anatasia. It even had a whole Paris holds the key to your heart element to the story. But at the beginning of the story you can definitely tell this is an unique story that can hold its own. The book did very well with the character development and the plot. The book never felt stale and the pacing keep the book moving at a well timed speed. The book is in multiple POV, but that let the characters have their own exemplary development.

However, the book did have a couple of downfalls. A prologue would have been great in this book and the nightmare of this book was all the spelling errors found on simple words. The book  will kidnap and reunion you with its fast paced scene and character changes and the part where the Ana is reminiscing with Grandma isn't what I expected, but the finale is what makes this book wonderful and its worth a read.

Verdict: If you didn't realize what I did there then make sure to read very slowly, maybe with a song or two playing in the background.",1522540800,4

* A copy of this book was provided by the publisher  for the purpose of an honest review. All conclusions are my own responsibility and I was not compensated for this review.

Whats it About? Garrett Gibson is used to the curiosity and disbelief surrounding her. As Englands only female physician shes pretty much seen and heard it all and handles herself very much like her male counterparts. Except when it comes to Ethan Ransom who makes her feel out of sorts and very female. His loyalties are questionable, his skills as a detective legendary, but its the way he sees and treats Garrett that has her questioning everything she thought she knew about men. Ethan is attracted to Garrett in a way that goes further than the physical and the timing couldn't be worse. He is about to undertake the most dangerous mission in his life and now Garrett is in the crossfire.

Overall reaction to the story? Its really no wonder that Hello Stranger made my Best Reads list for this year. This folks is what solid romances and author growth look like. Over the years Lisa Kleypas has established herself as one of, if not THE best historical romance authors out there and Ive read ALL of her historical romances so I can see why. However, todays romance readers, my generation, are vastly different from say, my mothers generation of romance readers and Kleypas has shown that, especially with this book, she understands and supports those differences. Her heroines are now less damsel in distress and more plucky, independent, and quirky. Theyre still historical romance heroines but they now reflect those REAL women in history that stood out and made life more interesting to say the least. Her heroes are defying convention by being open minded and confident about a womans abilities and worth outside of marriage. Its a wonderful change for an already amazing author to make. Is there a word above amazing? Because it totally qualifies here.

Hello Stranger has depth, charm, and a stout determination to tell a grand, sweeping romance between two unlikely, and unique characters in a time where being different was akin to committing an unforgivable crime.

Describe the hero in five words: Lonely. Determined. Romantic. Clever. Protective.
Did you like him? Yes. He has been added to my list of Book Boyfriends.
Why? Ethan is a poet at heart, only he doesnt know it. Hes already halfway in love with Garrett at the beginning of the book and it doesnt take long for him to fall completely in love with her. And the beautiful thing about that is that he doesnt deny it to himself. He is fully aware of how he feels, which at first seems at odds with his rough and tumble personality but Ethan is total book boyfriend material because he has such a big capacity for love, he just needed to meet someone who would accept him for who he was. He may not have intended to be a super sexy spy hero but he totally pulled it off and had me swooning over him.

Describe the heroine in five words: Plucky. Inquisitive. Determined. Kind. Strong.
Did you like her? I LOVED her.
Why? Garrett is one of those few female characters who can talk the talk and walk the walk. She is completely confident in her abilities as a doctor. In other words, she isn't playing doctor one moment and then becoming a completely useless female once the hero comes swooping into her life. She doesnt need to flatter anyones ego nor does she need to play the part of a woman who needs a man to save her. She tends to meet her attraction to Ethan like she does her work: Head on with a determination to find out the hows and whys. That said, another part of her charm is that she cant seem to turn off the scientific and medical part of her brain which provided more than a few laughs. Where most women are running silly girlish thoughts through their minds, Garrett is analyzing the effect Ethan has on her and her on him in a very scientific way. That made me smile because shes just so honest about their attraction; she isn't going to go with what society says she as a woman has to fake when it comes to men. Shes blessedly real without trying too hard, even when shes offering words of encouragement to other women, she comes off as natural and not a cheesy, forced, girl power clich.

Lets talk about the romance: The romance is where Hello Stranger really excels. Ethan and Garrett don't fight their attraction; they're pulled towards each other in a helplessly romantic way. Garrett always says what is on her mind and Ethan was always the more restrained one but it was those moments when they were together that Ethan showed just how desperately he cared for her and how romantic he could be. Not once did he mock or doubt Garretts abilities as a doctor, her intelligence and perseverance were two things he was attracted to (Men who love and appreciate independent women are so sexy). There were a lot of obstacles in front of these two but I really appreciate that Kleypas didn't make these two one of them. They fell in love and were determined to protect each other and find a way to be together. Some of the best parts of Hello Stranger were when Ethan and Garrett were in each others arms and just talking. Thats when I felt they were really building a solid relationship.

How about that supporting cast? I just love the Ravenels as a whole because they truly are a group of misfits who have banded together as a family. Theyre unconventional, they're loud, they're argumentative, and they're loyal to a fault. I loved the check in with Helena and Rhys because Helena was the calm, collected member of the family and yet she married a man with a louder and larger than life personality. I also wanted to see how the newest member of the family, Carys was doing. I hope she gets her own story too. The one Ravenel who always seemed to be missing or barely passing through in the series so far has been Weston but it was great to see a bit more of him this time around. I like him, hes entertaining.

Click It or Skip It? Click It. Hello Stranger is definitely one of those books that you wish you could forget what it was about just so you could have the pleasure of reading it again for the first time.",1522540800,5
8246,598,1794,"I love Marisa De Los Santos' books and I'll Be Your Blue Sky is no exception.  This story weaves in characters from two previous novels by de los Santos as well as provides a wonderful story and plot of it's own.  It's been a while since I read the other books, so I had to reacquaint myself with some characters, but that take away from anything. I'll Be Your Blue Sky works well as a stand-alone book, but once readers get sucked in to this one, I can't imagine they won't pick up her other work.

The story moves back in forth in time between Edith and Clare.  Clare is preparing to marry Zach, yet something about committing herself to him for life doesn't feel right.  When she runs into Edith, an elderly woman who just happens to be where Clare is setting up for the wedding, Edith gives Clare some wise advice.

We continue to get to know Edith and the remarkable things that happened throughout her life as the story unfolds. We also watch Clare put pieces of a puzzle together as she inherits Edith's home after her death.

I loved pretty much everything about this book.  The moving back and forth in time is seamless, the writing is amazing, there is a little suspense, a little romance, interesting characters, and plenty to think about and enjoy.  I'm hoping I'll Be Your Blue Sky becomes a book club favorite and that I can find a few friends to talk it over with.",1522540800,5

The series helped me visualize and relate to the story as a whole and gave me hope by reviving Jon through the Red god.

8251,567,1953,"How the Cowboy was Won is a cute, friends-to-lovers romance...and if that's all it was, I'd be giving it a slightly higher rating.

But...

It also has billed itself as ""a modern Emma with cowboys""--which it constantly reminds the reader of, with quotes from Austen's Emma at the beginning of each chapter, which do seem to reflect that chapter's events fairly well--but if you know the characters and plot of the original well, you soon realize that this one is more ""inspired by"" than a true retelling. The characters and plot are more vaguely reminiscent of the original than anything else, and if I'd been allowed to forget that this was ""supposed"" to be Emma, I would have been able to enjoy it more.

Because there is a lot to enjoy here--the friends-to-lovers trope is popular for a reason, after all. And nerdy heroes? They just can' be beat (but Mr. Knightley, sadly, isn't a nerdy hero. A bit of an antisocial homebody, sure, but not truly nerdy). Bold and brash heroines who like to do everything a bit extra can be a lot of fun too (but that's not at all what Emma was like--she was very much the proper society miss, worried about her image and upholding her place in the world) and you can't deny that Ember and Ranger have that chemistry that will successfully make the shift from besties to HEA nicely just as soon as they get out of their own way. But Ember comes to her realization far too early when compared to Emma's plot, and the whole Ranger-getting-a-new-and-better-job-far-away-from-Ember portion of it doesn't really have a corresponding bit in the original at all (unless it's supposed to go along with Emma thinking Knightley loves Jane? Except we already have several Ranger-in-love red herrings along the way, so that doesn't quite scan...)

So...if you 1) don't know Emma all that well or 2) can manage to put the other book out of your head while reading this one, chances are good that you'll give this book a higher rating than I'm able to. For me, it's going to be a case of ""I liked it, but...""

Rating: 3 stars / C

I voluntarily reviewed an Advance Reader Copy of this book.",1522540800,3
8252,571,385,"I found The Women in the Castle to be a very captivating book to read. The blurb gives away quite a lot of the storyline in the book, or so one would think. Actually, it just skimmed the surface, gives the reader some fact, which when you start to read the book, when more of the women's past are revealed not to mention decision they make for the future really shows how little you know about them.

I liked getting a story about the women left after a failed assassin attempt on Adolf Hitler. How they coped with their life after their husbands were executed. Living in a place where people (servants, villagers, etc.) were actually happy with the failed attempt and trying to build up a new life after the war ended. I liked how the author managed to surprise me as the story progressed with twists to the story that I had not anticipated.

The Women in the Castle storyline stretches all the way to modern time and I was engrossed in following the lives of these three very different women that had to cope with losing so much during the war. It's a book I recommend warmly!",1522627200,4

8256,187,385,"Jessica Shattuck writes historical fiction that features plenty of bravery along with lots of regret  for most of the main characters in her novel. To paraphrase one of the women in the castle (Ania), At the end of your life you have done what you have done. There is nothing you can change now. No talk in the world can change the past. It is what it is. She was remembering her participation in the early Nazi movement with the Hitler youth camps and her convenient blindness to what was really happening in Hitlers Germany. In the novels prologue, the story centers around the Burg (castle) Lingenfels beginning with a 1938 harvest party hosted by Marianne Von Lingenfels, niece-in-law of the castles countess. The castle is of her husband Albrechts ancestors. They have three children, Fritz, Elisabeth and Katarina, who will be in the story in somewhat minor rolls through the novels end.

The castle has fallen into a slightly ruined state by the time the drums of WWII are being heard. While the party is going on, Marianne notices that her husband, Albrecht; her dear childhood friend, Constantine (Connie) Fledermann and other leading citizens are not partying. She finds the men in Albrechts study. Marianne wants to know whats going on. Albrecht says, It seems Goebbels has given orders for the SA to incite rioting, destruction of Jewish property. Theyre throwing stones through shop windows and looting, making a sport Marianne says, How terrible! Albrecht says, Its descent into madness-Hitler is exactly the maniac weve suspected! It appears that the men are plotting to assassinate Hitler. What will happen to the wives and children of the plotters if they fail to kill Hitler? Her friend, Connie, knows that he and his co-conspirators will be hung if they botch the assassination attempt. If that happens, Connie says to Marianne, Then you will see to it that they (the plotter's women and children) are all right. You are appointed the commander of the wives and children. This prologue is the presupposition of the story.

 History tells us that the attempt to assassinate Hitler failed in 1944. All the conspirators were executed. That left the job of finding the scattered wives and children up to Marianne Von Lingenfels. Each of the recovered women seemed brave (and they were) on the surface but they also had hidden flaws that emerged later on in the novel. Connie Fledermanns young wife Benita and her son, Martin, were found wandering around the Russian section of Berlin in 1945. In Berlin, sleep had been rare. If it wasn't the Russian captain barging into what what was left of Benitas bombed-out flat, it was some other bas***d who didn't yet understand that she belonged to the captain. By the perseverance and bravery of Marianne, Benita is rescued from the Russians and Benitas son, Martin, is found in a Childrens Home under the name of Martin Schmidt. They are carted back to the castle, which will eventually become part of the American zone.

 At this point, the author starts flip-flopping between years 1938,1945,1944 and 1950 to give the reader a better insight to all the women. Next to be found and brought back to the castle is Ania Grabarek. Her husband was the Polish diplomat who brought the word of Kristallnacht to the 1938 harvest party secret meeting at the castle. She was found at the Tollingen Displaced Persons Camp. Marianne tells Anias boys, Anselm and Wolfgang, Your father was a brave man...its my honor to host his family. Once the families are settled in Burg Lingenfels, the story gets engrossing as we find out (remember we are flip-flopping years) what happened between the years 1938 through 1950 amongst these three women and their children individually. This is the juicy part that Im not going to divulge. I thought that the author, Jessica Shattuck, had excellent command of her prose and put down her words in a stark realistic way. Her style made the novel seem sad and dreary, which Im sure is the mood she wanted to effectuate.",1522627200,5
8257,3,1837,"Wow!  This book was just stellar in my opinion.  I don't know how the authors continue to produce such quality mysteries time after time.  I have read all the Ian Rutledge mysteries and this is one of the best.  This one is set in December 1920.  Ians sister Frances has just gotten married and Ian is feeling at loose ends.  He and his sister had become close after their parents deaths and now he is feeling a bit of a third wheel.  The wedding is over and the couple off on their honeymoon trip and Ian cant sleep.  He decides to take a drive to who knows where to settle down.  He is driving down the road and comes upon a car stopped in the middle of the road with a woman standing over a mans body and her hands are covered in blood.  Ian has literally driven into his next case.
As he begins his investigation, he lobbies to be given the case as he was the first on the scene.  There is some grumbling from other quarters, but Ian does land the case.  He questions the victims acquaintances and family.  He comes away with two very different pictures.  His acquaintances and friends reveal a well-liked man with no enemies.  His mother calls him a killer.  Ian cant understand such hatred of a mother for her own son, especially one who returned safely from the war.  Another man is found murdered and he too apparently is well-liked with no enemies.  What is the connection between the two men?  Ian really must dig to find this answer and it is taking too long.  Another murder is soon reported in a nearby village.  Ian realizes that it is connected to his case as the victim was known to have contact with the other two victims after a fashion.  Ian is dogged in his questioning again and again of certain people who had contact or knowledge of the victims.  He questions until someone reveals a small detail that leads to another detail that breaks open the case, but he must have proof and that might very well cost him.
This is one of my favorite mystery series and I eagerly look forward to the release of each book.  The writing is descriptive and puts me right there in the story.  Ian is not without his own struggles, which makes him so much more human and not just a character on the page.  I would recommend reading the first couple of books in the series though before reading this one.  Those will give the reader some valuable history and background on the main character.  Readers also will enjoy another series by this author featuring Bess Crawford, a nurse during the First World War.  Thanks to the writing team of Charles Todd for another excellent Ian Rutledge mystery!",1522627200,5
8258,185,1956,"Have you ever heard of helicopter parenting? Where a kids life is micromanaged? Id heard of the term but I had to look it up. Ive come to the conclusion that its a bonafide conflict and it plays an important role in this novel. Almost all the Argeneaus Ive met have been wonderful, exciting and fascinating people to read about. In Twice Bitten, Ms. Sands introduced me to someone that is also interesting but for all the wrong reasons.

Elspeth is a heroine in need of saving. She doesnt think so. I didn't think so either, until the hero, Wyatt, came upon the scene. Since a reader is gifted with both Elspeth and Wyatts points of view, it becomes quickly apparent that something is a bit off. But what could it be? How could it happen?

If a reader checked out the synopsis, theyll have an idea but the explanation, the reality of what is going on, is shocking. Frankly, I was horrified. Elspeths two sisters, The Boobsy Twins, first come across like Cinderellas wicked stepsisters. For a lot of the book, I did not like them until one pivotal scene shed some light on their true natures. I really didn't expect that. At. All. I think every one of them was in some kind of survival mode. What a way to live!

As for Wyatt  hes a very confused hero. He cant help but wonder what is going on with Elspeth. Slowly but surely he is eventually introduced to the reality that not only do Immortals exist, but Elspeth is one of them. The process from unknowing to knowing is one of the best parts of the book because so much happens to get him there. At times its funny, certainly entertaining, its sexy and hopeful. However, there are times where I got chills up my spine. The good thing about Wyatt? Hes solid hero material. Sure, he seems to take things in stride a little too easily, a bit too accepting and takes to hanging out with Immortals like a duck to water. That kind of blew my mind because you wouldnt catch ME being able to have that level of laissez-faire when presented with people who have fangs. Maybe its because Wyatt had a military background? No matter, hes sexy, yummy and perfect for Elspeth.

There is a lot to like in this novel. There is also a great deal of depth, suspenseful situations and rioting emotions that help create an amazing stage on which the romance between Elspeth and Wyatt plays out. I know that the story references Elspeths appearances in past books in the series, but it was hazy at best for me. I almost want to say this could be a standalone read, but perhaps not as once again the community that is the Argeneau family comes together to assist in fixing the debacle that surrounds Elspeth. I like it when the family members pitch in to support the current hero and heroine in their time of need. Its a great feeling.

Seriously, I enjoyed every moment of Twice Bitten and the happy ever after is smile-worthy. The wrap up was wonderful on many levels. It had me giggling and happy and I am ever so glad to hear the news that was imparted by a relative of Elspeths. There is hope for a bigger HEA for all involved; itll just take some time. The most important joy comes from Elspeth and Wyatt finally getting to stay together, forever. Its the perfect romantic ending. Fans of this series are in for another great read and a treat when they dive into their own copy of Twice Bitten. Ms. Sands rocks!

8259,236,1956,"Twice Bitten by Lynsay Sands is book 27 in the Argeneau series. This is the story of Elspeth Argeneau and Wyatt MacKay. This can easily be a standalone book.
Elspeth is part of the Argeneau family and even if she is a 140 year old vampire she has lived a somewhat shelter life but always a controlling one by her mother. Elspeth mother had taken the lost of her family hard and became obsessed with keeping Elspeth save and in her control. But Elspeth became free of her mother but knows she will come back to try to take control of her again. So in the meantime Elspeth is enjoying freedom and not planning on doing any commitments other than helping her Vampire group. But then she meets Wyatt who she finds attractive but it also seems he may be her life mate...which is a big commitment. Along with that there have been accidents happening to her also. Wyatt met Elspeth a few years back and fell in love with her but she has no memory of their meeting. I so enjoyed watching Wyatt and Elspeth story come together!
Ms. Sands writing is always so great and is a must read for sure!",1522627200,5

8261,711,1794,"Occasionally, there are times in your life that seem far too good to be true. And, unfortunately, they are. When the onion gets peeled, there could be rot underneath --- and thats exactly what happens to Clare Hobbes. In ILL BE YOUR BLUE SKY, Marisa de los Santos gives us a heroine whose greatest nightmare embarks her on a journey that is far greater than she ever could have imagined.

A strange woman has a heartfelt conversation with Clare the morning of her supposed wedding, a wedding that never happens. The lady, Edith, leaves her a home --- a grand old house on the Delaware Shore. (I don't want to give away how this happens!) She convinces Clare to follow her heart and not get married. But the things that await her at Blue Sky House are mysterious and moving, and create a story within the story that highlights the shocking things that make up a life well lived.

It is an unexpected story, each detail delving further and further into a past that somehow exhibits so many parallels to Clares herself. ILL BE YOUR BLUE SKY is a mystery wrapped in a mystery wrapped in a love story wrapped in well, lets just say its multi-genre and so much more fascinating for that depth.

There are disturbing elements here that de los Santos handles with wonderful discernment and decorum. Domestic violence is an important part of the book, so be prepared for some intense moments. However, the drama is served more intensely for the inclusion of real-world issues and subtly shapes this into a novel of great resonance in this #MeToo era. It is eerily prescient of the zeitgeist and will move many readers to look at todays news in a different way.

ILL BE YOUR BLUE SKY is an optimistic story. No matter what one is thrown by the vagaries of being alive and human, the way that one handles those unexpected difficulties becomes the only test that matters. Clares test may not look like everyones, but the beauty of her need for information and her ability to process difficult things and move forward make this a family saga that burns brightly with truths that reach far beyond average womens fiction. de los Santos fashions a novel that will speak to all readers and make for some very interesting conversations in book clubs willing to look deeply into this beautiful story.

8262,571,930,"Munich is a book that I read quickly, probably because the book was not that thick, but I have to admit that I was also totally captivated by the story set during four days in September 1938. Robert Harris is a writer who has the ability to write books, whether it's historical or more modern, that captivate and Munich is definitely no exception. Something I thought while reading the book was how little I really knew about the Munich agreement or, probably more accurately, I remembered, and I was fascinated to read how Chamberlain really sought to preserve peace in Europe, while Hitler seemed to strive to go to war.

I found the story to be very compelling, while the men of power are planning a meeting in Munich, things are happening off the scene. Not everyone in Germany is on Hitler's side and some of them wouldn't mind getting rid of him. For Hugh Legat, one of Chamberlain's private secretaries, will these four days become very intense when an old friend contacts him again. Paul Hartmann, German diplomat and member of the anti-Hitler movement. Can they stop Hitler's plans?

Munich is captivating, well-written and memorable. I'm particularly impressed with the personality descriptions and especially Chamberlain whose will was to preserve peace at any price. Was it cowardly to sign the Munich Agreement to ignore the signs that this is only a respite? Well, we have the luxury of being able to look back and know that nothing had stopped Hitler and I have to admit that I feel sympathy for Chamberlain and his peacekeeping attitude.",1522627200,4
8263,711,1959,"It is 1940 in England, and tension is high. Blackouts and gas masks are part of daily life.  However, even as war encroaches throughout Europe from Germany, crime and corruption are still a threat to society. There are still cases to be investigated and solved.

With World War II as the backdrop, TO DIE BUT ONCE is the 14th book in Jacqueline Winspears Maisie Dobbs series. In this latest installment, a local youth has gone missing.

Local pub owner Phil Coombes asks Maisie to look into the disappearance of his son. Joe, just 15 years old, has been working as an apprentice to Yates and Sons, a local paint and decorating company. His job takes him out of London on a special war assignment to paint buildings on airfields. He must be secretive about his work, but his parents are accustomed to hearing from him regularly. It has been some time now since they last talked to him. Phil mentions to Maisie that as of late, Joes demeanor has changed from cheerful to quiet and sullen. He also has complained of headaches. What could have happened to him?

Maisie takes the case with the help of her able assistants, Billy and Sandra. When a young man is found dead in a local village, Maisie is asked to come and view the body. Sadly, it is Joe. His head had been bashed in, in what looks like a fall from some height that landed him in a railroad line yard. The first surmise is that the fall killed him. Did he jump? Was he pushed? Was it an accident? The autopsy is inconclusive, but the pathologist finds toxic matter in his brain.

Maisie continues her inquiry, interviewing Joes friends and coworkers about his life before his untimely death. She uncovers a link to possible connections to an infamous crime lord who is known for being ruthless in his dealings. When the puzzle pieces of the case finally come together to solve Joes death, the Coombes family is devastated.

While in the midst of her investigation, Maisies professional and personal lives unexpectedly come to cross purposes. On Maisies home front, adoption plans are moving forward for the young evacuee for whom she has been caring. And then her longtime friend, Priscilla, has her own crisis in the making when her son, Tim, takes off with a friend in a boat to help rescue the British Expeditionary Forces in Dunkirk. This emotional scenario brings back the losses and tragedies of World War I that both women faced.

TO DIE BUT ONCE highlights the direct and indirect costs of war. Maisie Dobbs is always looking for truth and the underlying motives in her cases. Her stories are ones that this reviewer always wants to read because of her character, values and thoughts on life. And, because Jacqueline Winspears late father was also a young apprentice in 1940, she is able to draw on that experience to write a story about WWII and England that is close to the heart.

8264,1071,132,"There are two books here really. While the author pulls them together, it didn't work for me. Charlie, a young pregnant American, spurs Eve - a former spy from the real life Alice Network - to go ahunting for someone she knew during WWI when she worked as a spy. Surely there was another way to get to the story of the fascinating women who made up The Alice Network in WWI.

Theirs is a fascinating story pulled from history, and I am going to try to find an actual historical nonfiction book about the Alice Network, because it's a worthy story about some very courageous and strong women. I have read so many books about the male spies of both World Wars, but never have I read much about female spies - unless they were peripheral to the male main character. This is different.

I only wish Kate Quinn had left Charlie out completely. She is half the book, and she took away rather than added to the story. Perhaps it was the strong contrast with Eve, but if the book had been her story alone, I would probably not have picked it up, and I certainly wouldn't have finished it. I found myself dreading her chapters. I also did not need a love story in the middle of a wonderful read about strong women who didn't need men to get through their daily life. Without Charlie, this book would have passed the Bechdel test and all the other feminist tests with flying colors. Because of Charlie, it doesn't pass any.

If the book had been purely about Eve and the Alice Network women, it would have rated much higher for me. Charlie's story and her character brought the entire thing down, with yet another woman who only finds herself in the eyes of some man. Love is wonderful, but it took up space and time in this book that would have been better devoted to the story that mattered.",1522627200,3
8265,436,1756,"Title: Truly Devious

Author: Maureen Johnson

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Mystery/Thriller

Series: Truly Devious, book one

Star Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

Ive been a fan of Maureen Johnsons work since I had the pleasure of reading her debut novel, 13 Little Blue Envelopes. From there, I was a devoted, shameless fangirl. So when I heard that she had a brand new book coming out, the first in a projected series, I was thrilled. Its been sitting in my library stack for a while, and I couldn't renew it anymore, so I pushed it to the top of the stack and went for it. Johnson presents a tantalizing, creepy, and humorous series debut that had me guessing until the last moment; I finished it on Saturday and Im still chewing on it, reeling, wondering if there was something that I missed. Rife with riddles, intrigue, and dark humor, I loved Truly Deviousone of the best books of 2018, hands down, and I cant wait for the sequels!

Truly Devious opens with a creepy, frightening ransom letter that rhymes, setting the tone for the rest of the novel. In a way, this book is like a two for one; it goes back and forth from 1936 to the present day. Stephanie Stevie Bell has been accepted to the prestigious Ellingham Academy, named after the riddle-loving millionaire who opened the school. Drawn to the school for the mysterious double murder that occurred there, she finds a group of friends who accepts her for all her quirks. But when one of her classmates dies in an accident, she finds herself wrapped up in a web of lies, deceit, and intrigue, racing against the clock to stop Truly Devious once again. But it seems that this time it is Stevie herself in the killers crosshairs, and some secrets just won't stay buried

This book was, in a word, fantastic. I was utterly captivated, and I loved the way Johnson transitioned between 1936 and the present day. The pacing was breakneck; the book grabbed me by the throat and didn't let go, not even after the last killer cliffhanger. The format was part of what drew me in; it went from the present day to various documents from the cold case of the Ellinghams murder. I was captivated; I loved the historical angle of that part of the story. I also really liked Stevie, who is a bit of a weirdo with an obsession with true crime (much like yours truly!). She was one of my favorite characters in the book, spunky and smart and so unapologetically herself. The pacing was breakneck, and I was laughing, cheering, and scratching my head; this is one of the best books of 2018, and one of the best mystery-thriller novels Ive read recently. I was constantly guessing, riveted by the prose, chock full of dark humor and heart. And that endingoh my goodness, I need the sequel right now! Like, right now. Maureen Johnson, I love you so much, and I cant wait for more from this new, deliciously creepy series opener! The bottom line: A creepy, riveting murder mystery that goes back and forth between 1936 and the present day, Truly Devious was exciting, feminist, and shocking, and I cant wait for the next books in the series! Ill never forget Ellingham Academy, its residents, and its dark history! Next on deck: Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi!",1522627200,5

8267,711,1937,"Twenty years before the actual story gets underway, tragedy struck the small town of Petroleum. A beloved high school athlete died in a bizarre accident in a local mills grain elevator. This shocking incident forever changed Petroleum, as the mill closed down and a number of people became unemployed. The main culprit turned out to be the victims 14-year-old brother, Robert Golden. The residents of Petroleum were ruthless and cruel to Robert, and made him leave the town soon after.

Fast forward two decades later, and the town is in the same place as it was immediately following the tragedy --- in a permanent state of latent depression. But then Robert comes back; his mother is dying, and he wants to spend her final days with her. His return stirs the towns ghosts, but it also brings a positive change to the life of 30-year-old Mary Crampton.

Mary is an embalmer who works in her fathers mortuary. She has been a resident of Petroleum her entire life; her mother died while giving birth to her, and she didn't have the courage to leave her father. Both the children and adults find her to be strange and are mean to her. Like everybody else, Mary has dreams. Yet she has buried hers deep inside, and painstakingly tries to fit in with a town that refuses to accept her. Mary and Robert are the outcasts, which is what brings them together. Roberts return and their short-term friendship will force Mary to wake up from her dormant life and unearth her dreams.

Susan Hendersons latest novel is a poetic, melancholic and slow-paced story that focuses on relationships more than drama. It also touches on a variety of important topics, including the mentality of a small town, being different, the complex relationship between father and daughter, and pursuing your dreams versus living up to other peoples expectations.

The book is told from Marys perspective, so you almost feel as if you're reading her diary as she recounts her memories, dreams, fears and frustrations, along with recent happenings in the town. What makes this story especially beautiful is the writing, which is so good and so magical that it compelled me to think about my own life and even made me shed a few tears in public.

THE FLICKER OF OLD DREAMS is an absolute literary delicacy and already is one of my favorite novels of the year. This is a story that should be read, reread and enjoyed.

8273,571,1958,"I listened to the audio version of this book narrated by Barrie Kreinik and Erin Mallon. The funny thing is that I thought it was the same person voicing both Alice and Lucy. But, I noticed when the audiobook has started only Barrie Kreinik is listed as a narrator. So, no wonder I thought that it was one person. It didn't help that they voiced was very similar, only with Alice voice being softer. Anyway, that's beside the point, the narrators did a good job with this book. Part of the charm of this book was how easy the book was to listen to.

Nevertheless, I found myself having trouble connecting with the characters. I didn't think they were fleshed out enough to make me care for them. Sure, we get background events on both Alice and Lucy, but I found myself thinking after I finished the book that I couldn't see them before my eyes while I listened to the book. Frankly, all the characters felt a bit flat to me. The same thing could I say about Tangier. Because of the lack of connection with the characters and not feeling the atmosphere of Tangier couldn't I completely be engrossed in the story.

However, there was something about the story that made me continue listening, a need to know what really happened when Alice and Lucy went to school and what would happen next. I may not be totally engrossed in the story, but I was curious to know more all the way through the book. I can't say that the book surprised me, but the last part, when you realize where everything is going is quite good.

Tangerine is a so-so so book. I kind of liked the book, but I never really found myself completely enjoying the book. Perhaps if the characters had been more fleshed out and if the city had been better described in a way that I have felt transported to it had the book worked better.",1522627200,3
8274,571,1784,"The Woman in the Window is a book that I'm on the fence about. The writing is good, the storyline is, for the most part, both interesting and engaging. However, the book lacks surprises and suspense. And, the twists to the story is easy to foresee.

Yet, I found myself quite liking the book. It could be that the book reminded me of Rear Window with James Stewart, or the main characters love for old movies that charmed me since I adore old classic Hollywood movies. The biggest problem, however, is the use of a main character that is unstable, thanks to mental issues because of a past trauma (that was easy to figure out) and the combination of drugs and alcohol. I've come across too many unstable characters on books lately that I've started to avoid psychological thrillers with even the mentioning of characters with mental issues or in any.

The writing is good, the story, however, lacks the necessary twist to truly engage and the ending was too obvious. Although part of me enjoyed the last confrontation. I can actually see how this book would make a great movie. I just wish the story had been more surprising.",1522627200,3

Then Lucy starts getting a little too possessive and an tragic incident breaks them apart, possibly forever. Fast-forward in time, Alice is living in Tangiers with her husband. She is still pretty messed up, but is coping. When Lucy shows up at her doorstep, Alices carefully set-up life starts to crumble. The story moves between the past and the present. Both characters are very well drawn, even if the men in their lives are a little less developed. As much as it makes Tangiers feel like a terrible place, it also makes it look so good that I wanted to book a tour immediately. If only I could also travel back in time to when men wore fedoras!

8276,711,1958,"Early reviews have compared debut novelist Christine Mangan to masters of the psychological thriller, such as Alfred Hitchcock, Daphne du Maurier, and that most sought-after analogy, Gillian Flynn. Theyre not completely wrong. TANGERINE, set in the steamy Moroccan city of Tangier on the eve of its independence from France, has mystery, betrayal, psychological war games, and, of course, a parade of characters whose motives are both conflicted and often obscured, even from themselves.

The story opens at an asylum in Spain where a woman is trying to compose her thoughts, hampered by the fog that clouds them. She is troubled and paranoid, remembering her past in Tangier with both nostalgia and distaste. Then we are back in time, in Tangier, where Alice Shipley lives with her husband, John. He goes to work each day, but mostly lives off his wifes trust fund. Increasingly, their lives are separate, as Alice struggles with her dislike of the city that has kept her captive in her peaceful apartment. Slowly the reader learns that a trauma the previous year has left her with feelings of anxiety and depression, and that perhaps her marriage to John and move to Morocco were a failed attempt to escape them.

Enter Lucy, Alices college roommate and onetime best friend. Whatever happened the previous year implicates her, but why is not clear until the denouement. Lucy is a complex character who, in Alices mind, is the most beautiful woman I ever met. An orphan, she went to Bennington on a scholarship and arrived in Tangier having saved her salary from the job she got after graduation. Why she is there is not entirely clear.

As soon as Lucy meets John, the two are wary of each others intentions. Nevertheless, John suggests she move into their flat, and she accepts. The rest of the novel, alternating between the perspectives of Lucy and Alice, depicts the dance among the three --- and the willful misinformation that each conveys to the other. Is John a protective husband and a hardworking agent of a British company, as he suggests? Is Alice a devoted wife whose past tragedies are behind her? And is Lucy visiting her friend in order to revive their earlier friendship that dissolved because of a misunderstanding?

Mangan is not afraid of giving her characters plenty of room to explore their motivations and, just as important, the perceived motivations of those around them. At times, the heated analysis can veer into melodrama --- the cinematic possibilities are clearly on display here --- but there is still plenty of fast-paced action. Where it all leads is presaged at the beginning, so part of the enjoyment is watching how it unfolds. Though a little clunky at times, Mangan writes so well that readers will overlook any misplaced red herrings in an effort to find out how she pulls offthe final scenes.

TANGERINE --- the name given to those expats who fall in love with the city --- is a delicious, if overwrought, blend of psychological thriller, travelogue and whodunit that is likely to find a big audience, first of readers and then of moviegoers.

By sheer coincidence, I read the bulk of the novel and finished it on World Autism Awareness Day.

Christopher Boone is a 15-year-old on the autism spectrum. He doesnt like to be touched, hates the colors yellow and brown, likes animals, and has sensory issues.

While walking alone one night, Christopher discovers a neighbors standard poodle lying dead in her yard, a garden fork still in its lifeless body. Christopher decides to investigate and uncover the killer.

Christopher is not only the viewpoint character, he is writing the novel, so the reader has a good idea of what he is thinking at any given time, except for those periods when his mind becomes overwhelmed by sensory input and he shuts down. Otherwise, we follow Christophers use of logic in trying to uncover the mystery.

The mystery, if Im being completely honest, really wasn't much of one. I knew the answer long before it was revealed. But in exploring the circumstances surrounding Wellingtons death, Christopher stumbles across a new mystery.

The secondary mystery was a bit painful to read, as, again, what had happened was very obvious, but it did lead Christopher to undertaking an adventure that required a great deal of bravery and a willingness to try to overcome the struggles his illness presents on a daily basis.

From having read memoirs from parents of autistic children (and authors who either had Aspergers Syndrome themselves, or had siblings with it), I believe this to be a fairly accurate portrayal of the illness, though it is important to remember that not all who suffer the disorder exhibit the same symptoms or require the same level of treatment.

Overall, this was an interesting book if it is viewed from the perspective of presenting an under-represented type of protagonist. As a mystery, it is lacking.

Like Manifest Destiny, for example. From what I recall from my K-12 history classes, this was a largely positive event, stretching the US from sea to shining sea. There's some token acknowledgment that it meant ""resettling"" the Native Americans, but it's not dwelled upon. Dee Brown's Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, though, tells the story of the settling of the American continent from the people who were there first.

Since he focuses on the era of Manifest Destiny (there's some information about how European arrival in the Americas played out, but it's a small portion of the book), Brown confines his focus to the West. It's heartwrenching to read about from the perspective of now, because you know that each chief that tries to negotiate in good faith with the white people will eventually be cheated and that each warrior who tries to fight back against the people who were eroding their way of life will eventually lose. Brown uses as many Native American sources as possible to show how the westward march of white settlers progressed from the point of view of the people who were pushed away from the land and lifestyle they'd always known in order to make room. With each passing year, restrictions on their territory become tighter and tighter, but their inability to safeguard even the small promises that they were able to extract is just relentlessly sad to read about.

I think it's important to wrestle with all parts of American history, and remember that many of what we think of as gains come from losses by someone else. As such, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who's interested in how this country has treated its original residents.",1522627200,4

I was starting to question my love for the unreliable narrator after so many alcoholic and agoraphobic narrators. Yawn. Yawn. OBVIOUSLY, they are unreliable! It's so much more fun for the reader to figure out IF the narrator is trustworthy or not. Are we being lied to? Who can we believe? I love the simple mystery of figuring out which characters we can trust.

In THE WIFE, Alafair Burke has created the perfect blend of a character driven suspense novel with some police investigation (just enough) and courtroom drama (again, just enough!). On top of that perfect combo, Burke is a gifted storyteller and creates tension in small ways. The story feels relevant and timely; seriously, this book feels like it was written this month, all the current events are spot-on accurate.

The story is full of twists, but not huge IN YOUR FACE twists, again, just small enough that you read a sentence a couple of times to make sure you got it right!

I grew up with Anne's story, but did not indulge in the books until recently.  When I read Anne of Green Gables, I forced myself to be patient as I waited so some of my favorite adventures to appear.  When they did not appear in Anne of Avonlea, I lost faith.

Anne of the Island had all my favorite missing bits from the Anne television program I grew up watching, and so much more!  From the Rollings Reliable Baking Powder Company to all the bits with Gilbert Blythe.... It was all there, every little piece of my melted heart along with prose that grips the imagination and summons forth tears and laughter with equal ease.  I met darling Philippa and delighted in Patty's Place with it's little orchard and two china dogs, and in the three sweet cats.

Most of all, reading Anne of the Island was like meeting a bosom friend deep in a flowering wood, when apple blossoms scent the air and birds flutter softly overhead.  Anne is and ever will be a dear friend.  It seems, sometimes, she knows all my secret worries and wishes, and knows all the right things to say.

If she were flesh and blood I would embrace her tightly, but I am grateful to have her in these pages, and that she has many adventures yet.

I recommend not only Anne of the Island, but the entire Anne of Green Gables series to anybody and everybody.  From her childhood fancies to her mature philosophies, Anne Shirley is the most enchanting character I have ever met.",1522713600,5

Its a cruel, cruel world. And the people are the worst part

Mark my words, this is going to be one of the biggest books that 2018 will offer, and it will be completely deserving of every award it will win. Dread Nation is the perfect mix of action and suspense, while always having oppression be at the forefront of the story. This book was thought-provoking, moving, intense, so very well written, and completely and absolutely enthralling. This book was nothing short of amazing and its one of the best things Ive read this entire year.

Jane McKeene is a sixteen-year-old girl, who has never known a world where the dead don't walk among humans. And I use the word walk to really mean that they are zombies that will bite you and make you into one of them to continue on their never-ending killing spree. They can be fast, they can be smart, but they will always be very deadly.

Jane grew up on a plantation in Kentucky, where her mother actually runs the plantation. Jane is biracial (black and white), but her mother tries to keep it a secret that Jane is her daughter. There are other women who help raise and take care of Jane, but once she turns fourteen she is taken to Massachusetts to attend Miss Prestons School of Combat. And thats where the story truly takes off.

Keeping the peace in this country isn't that hard, as long as nobody important dies.

Just like actual history, even though slavery is abolished, white people come up with different ways to keep people of color as slaves, but just without the title. The blacks and Native children in this world have to go to combat schools to eventually protect the whites from zombies. Miss Prestons School of Combat is actually one of the better schools, and Jane is learning to become an attendant, which means she will watch over a rich white woman and protect her at all costs upon graduating and/or purchase.

Jane isn't sure if this is the life she wants, even though she doesnt have many options. All she knows that she wants to get back to Kentucky and see her mother and the people she loves again. But Jane soon enters a world of conspiracy and sabotage, filled with people who warp religion to do their racist bidding. Jane then quickly realizes that humans are far more dangerous than the zombies that shes been training to kill.

The problem in this world aint sinners, or even the dead. It is men who will step on anyone who stands in the way of their pursuit of power.

This story is told in two parts, and in a very unique way. Between each chapter there is a letter either from Jane or from her mother. This helps weave the story together, and lets you know more about Janes past and what will become of her future. My heart broke more and more as the correspondence went on, but I also found myself more and more desperate for more letters. I not only loved this story, but I love the way the story was told. I want to read everything by Justina Ireland.

This book mirrors the society we live in today and makes you think about all those uncomfortable topics that people would rather ignore and pretend do not exist. From prison systems, to black lives matter, to systemic racism, this book is going to make a lot of people uncomfortable, specifically white people. But its the kind of uncomfortability people need in this day and age when we are normalizing hate speech and passing it off as free speech. Where we are living in a world where white supremacists can rally and spread their hatred at no cost, but black people fear for their life when being pulled over by the cops. Our country cares more about trying to stop football players kneeling for that injustice than doing anything to actually fix it, while also trying to misconstrue their protests as something that it isnt. We need this uncomfortability and, more importantly, things need to change.

The racial diversity in this is so important, too, because not only is this book unapologetically black, it also heavily talks about what it is like to be a black person that is light enough to pass as white. What it feels like to feel like you don't belong in either community, because youll be reminded that you're not black enough and because people will constantly remind you that youll never be white. I have a very close friend who talks to me about this, and its just something that is near and dear to my heart and I love that Justina incorporated this element on top of an amazingly diverse cast of characters and while also having important discussions that reflects the world we live in today.

Most important, it was my fault that my skin was brown and Mommas wasn't and that she had the terrible misfortune to love me anyway.

Also, Jane is so not straight! I don't feel comfortable giving her a label, but I do personally feel like she identifies under the bisexual umbrella. But it is important to note that there is not a relationship between Jane and another girl on page.

And there is a major character that is part of the ace community! I cant personally speak about this representation, but I thought it was very thoughtfully done. Plus, we need so many more stories that just normalizes sexuality. And even though I think authors are being better about LGBTQIAP+ representation, I still find it harder to find asexual characters. Even though this mention is brief, I loved this inclusion.

If you want to read a book about black girls killing zombies and putting a stop to white power-hungry men (because who honestly wouldnt?) please give Dread Nation a try. And I hope if you do give it a try, that you will take something from it and help to raise and support marginalized voices.

This all being said; this review is coming to you from a very white and privileged reviewer. PoCs voices are the ones that matter and, more importantly, are the voices that need to be heard. Because you all might think a lot has changed in 2017 from 1865, but it really hasnt.

I honestly cant sing this books praises enough. And please, Justina, give us more of Jane and this world! I loved this story with my whole heart. And I completely agree with Kelly that HBO should scrap their gross version of the American Civil War with Confederate and just buy the rights to this book immediately. This book is powerful, this book is beautiful, this book is life changing.",1522713600,5
8291,70,1964,"Reading stories that are filled with oppression, especially of the racial variety, is always very tough for me. I usually end up getting so very angry at the oppressors that I just cant finish the book. I knew that going in, Dread Nation was going to be one of those stories that could be hit or miss for me. Turns out it was an absolute hit, but it was in no way an easy read. There is plenty of action, an element of mystery, and humor but what there was an apparent absence of is fairness. Nothing is fair in this story. Do not expect for there to be any sunshine and rainbows or HEAs. This story is about survival and survival is not always pretty.

Jane McKeene, a Negro, was born shortly before the dead rose up to walk the world. She has known nothing beyond what the world became after the zombies destroyed everything. Slavery had been abolished but shortly after Congress had funded the Negro and Native Reeducation Act to have schools started like Miss Prestons School of Combat for Negro Girls. It was determined that Negros and Native Americans were resistant to the bite of shamblers (zombies) and therefore should be taught how to become attendants to protect the white people from falling prey.

Jane and her classmates at Miss Prestons School of Combat for Negro Girls were taught how to kill shamblers in the most efficient manner possible. Jane may have been the top of her class in many ways but she definitely did not fit the mold that the instructors were trying to force her in. She was extremely intelligent and was very aware of societies perceptions of her abilities. Everything changed for Jane when someone she was close to asked for her help in finding a sibling. While trying to discover what may have happened to the missing family Jane stumbled upon a conspiracy that had dire consequences.

Jane is truly a unique character in that she is aware of the unfairness equated to her and those of Negro and Native American race but her knowledge does not stop her from rising above it and doing what is right. Not to say that Jane is good per se because she was no stranger to letting others take the fall for her actions or bending the rules and laws when it suited her but she does whatever she can to protect those around her whether they deserve it or not. I loved this about her character! She was sweet, saucy, and fierce!

The writing was thought provoking, painted a clear picture of the events between characters, and was paced very well. What I wanted more of was world development. I have an understanding of history and can imagine what the country would have looked like but with the story being told from Janes perspective it was based upon only what she saw or interacted with. So, in my minds eye if I was to imagine what was beyond a wall I was left to my own imagination. That might not matter to some but it matters to me in story that is set in an alternate world. Overall though, Dread Nation is an amazing read, and even better, is part of a series! I am eagerly awaiting the sequel and am dying to see where the story goes!

This review is based on a complimentary book I received from Edelweiss+. It is an honest and voluntary review. The complimentary receipt of it in no way affected my review or rating.",1522713600,4

8293,668,1964,"Based on review copy

4.5 stars

Plot: Ireland's creative mind had her wondering ""what if the Civil War were interrupted by the dead rising and eating everyone?"" and I loved every minute of it. From Ireland's author note, she put a lot of research into the historical accuracy of this book (save you know, the zombies) and explored the bigotry and pure hatred from those who wanted to control both blacks and natives.

I thoroughly enjoyed Dread Nation as it was more complex than expected. Dread Nation tackled conspiracies, politics, and explored how powerful whites continued to ensure their positions. There was nonstop action that was broken up with letters Jane wrote back home which made Dread Nation a real page-turner. Fair warning, the ending will have you wanting to get your hands on book 2 to continue the adventure and learn more about Jane's world.

Character: One thing I didn't expect was Dread Nation to be funny, and that's all thanks to Jane McKeene. Jane was full of sass and sarcasm and I adored her. She understood the complexities of her world and was not amused by any of the ""negros are no better than livestock"" conversations that she had to participate in. I don't think there are words to explain how much I loved Jane; she was a survivor and that sometimes meant that she had to do some messy things, she was clever, and she was a complete badass with a pair of sickles.

What I also loved about Dread Nation was how easily Ireland introduced side characters. There were characters who were fated to die 10 minutes later that I still cared about. I especially adored Jane's relationship with her fellow Attendant, Katherine.

There wasn't much romance in Dread Nation, but I wonder if that is planned for later down the road.

Worldbuilding: 1860's zombie-invested United States was one of the most realistic worlds I've ever had the pleasure of stepping in to. It was so believable to me because Ireland explored the power struggle of whites demanding to stay in command even with dead people literally eating their neighbors.

Dread Nation took place predominately in two locations, the urban and (rumored) zombie-free Baltimore as well as the frontierland of Kansas. I was amazed by how Ireland had politics respond to the zombie outbreak and what lengths people would go to in order to feel safe and have any sort of semblance of their former lifestyle.

Short N Sweet: Dread Nation is an exhilarating page-turner with a main character you'll fall in love with almost immediately.",1522713600,4

8295,757,1965,"My Dear Hamilton is a compelling and magnificently crafted historical fiction novel. Its the second one that Ive read by Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie. And, just like the first book, I devoured it.  My Dear Hamilton is a five-star, beautifully written and well-researched read. Although I don't normally read political books, these two, The First American Daughter, and My Dear Hamilton had me captivated until the very last page. Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie brought the founding fathers, and Eliza Schuyler Hamilton alive for me.

My knowledge of Eliza Schuyler Hamiltons accomplishments, before reading My Dear Hamilton was limited, but now, after finishing the book, Eliza has my complete admiration. She was strong, elegant, and independent. Eliza Hamilton carried herself with grace, even in the face of humiliation, multiple betrayals, and several devastating losses. Mrs. Hamiltons loyalty to her country and her husband was nothing short of extraordinary.

Eliza tells her husbands story, his greatness, his flaws and his crushing secrets. Although this book is a historical fiction novel, it reads like a biography. I know Ill be rereading it, while anxiously waiting for the next book crafted by these talented writers. Highly recommended.

Thank you, William Morrow Publishing and Edelweiss, for my advanced review copy. I loved it!",1522713600,5
8296,124,1965,"My Dear Hamilton is a poignant and powerful tale that gives us a glimpse into the life of one the worlds most notable women in our nations history. From the very first page of this telling story you will be pulled into this woman's world and have the opportunity to not only see the world through her eyes, but also get a tangible feel for it too. Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton has never really been given the opportunity to shine in our history books, almost always taking a backseat to her famous husband, but that all changes with this book... she shines brightly! It follows her through the many stages of her life, the struggles she faced after her husband's transgressions, and how she fought hard to overcome it all... and it was downright inspiring!!

I am somewhat of a newbie to the historical fiction genre, having tried it in the past and deciding it wasn't my cup of tea, but I have to say not only am I overjoyed that I decided to take a second chance on it, despite that fact, but that this one may just have swayed my opinion in a BIG way. After this impressive and delightful re-introduction, I think it is safe to say that I will be making time to read more from these two very talented ladies. I highly recommend you get your hands on this book, it is a beautifully crafted tale that should not be missed!

8297,248,1965,"If you've seen the musical or listened to the soundtrack of Hamilton, you might THINK you know Eliza's story but this well written novel rounds it out in a pleasurable and informative way.  It tells the Hamilton story through Eliza's eyes.  She's actually a heroine in her own right, which is often missed because everyone focuses on him.  Well researched and written, this is a very good piece of historical fiction.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.

8298,482,1965,"My Dear Hamilton is a powerful read. Authors Dray and Kamoie have once again written another seamless story about a significant woman whom history has long ignored. Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton has been known as merely the wife of American giant Alexander Hamilton. This historical novel pulls her out of the shadows and gives her center stage. Her life spanned some of the most integral parts of early American history: the frontier, the Revolution, the building of the Republic, and the antebellum years. Eliza was a stoic woman, facing what life threw at her, most of which resulted from her husband's military and political careers. The story reveals a well rounded view of Hamilton and how his wife may have reacted to all of his exploits. The book deftly illustrates what a scalawag he was as well. I enjoyed the authors' notes at the end. No official biography of Eliza Hamilton exists, but this book will give readers a tantalizing glimpse of her life.  Thanks to a kind publicist I was able to read an advance galley of the book before it was officially published.",1522713600,5
8299,124,1966,"Just on the cusp of college graduation Harry Ackerson receives word from home that his father has suddenly passed away, so rather than stick around for graduation, he heads home to bury his father and get some answers. Once he arrives home, he starts to dig into his father's death, and also starts to help his step-mother settle some things and learn how to adjust to being on her own. But somewhere along the way, lines start to get crossed, seductions take place, and Harry finds himself sharing a bed with his gorgeous step-mother.

And if that isn't enough to deal with, then he meets a beautiful girl name Grace, initially she seems like the perfect woman for him, but then things take an interesting turn, and he starts to have doubts. As much as he likes her, there is something telling him to be wary of her, she says she is new to town, but things just aren't adding up... and he is starting to think she maybe involved in his father's past.

All The Beautiful Lies is a thrilling literary escapade riddled with obsession, revenge, secrets, and murder! The instant you crack the cover on this one you will be mesmerized by Mr. Swanson's crafty words, and mind twisting plot... it was downright addictive!! This is my first read by this author and I have to say he gained a new fan with this one, I will definitely be checking out more of his books in the very near future! If you are a lover of twisted thrillers, then this one will be right up your alley... my advice, be prepared to hang out on the edge of your seat the whole way through!! Highly Recommend!!

8300,16,1966,"I would pick up All the Beautiful Lies on the cover alone - but it's Peter Swanson's writing and plotting that is the real draw for me.

When Harry's father Bill dies, he travels back to Maine to the home Bill shared with his second wife Alice. Harry doesn't know Alice very well, but he feels obligated to stay with her right now. He does find Alice - and her behaviour - a bit unsettling. When the police reveal that Bill's death was not an accident, his unease increases....

All the Beautiful Lies unfolds in a then and now timeline. We get to to know Alice from her childhood through to current day. No spoilers, but there are reasons she makes Harry uneasy. Her chapters were decidedly unsettling. There is another 'past' POV from someone in Alice's life that adds much to why and who Alice is. Again, I don't want to reveal too much. The present is the investigation into Bill's death and Harry's POV.

Oh, Swanson is a master of manipulating the reader. Just when you think you have things figured out, the story takes a sharp left. I honestly didn't see the first turn coming - or the ending twist. Another great read from Swanson.",1522713600,4

8302,816,1957,"What a Difference a Duke Makes is the first installment of a new series by Lenora Bell, School for Dukes. This was a beguiling story inspired by Mary Poppins and I had such a good time reading it.

Miss Mari Perkins is our heroine, and  that's Mari-rhymes-with-starry, if you please. Mari was raised in an oppressive orphanage and has come to London to find work as a governess and find out more about her her parentage. When the proprietor of the employment agency refuses Mari a position, she takes it upon herself to present herself to a duke's residence and pose as a quality governess. Mari was a delightful heroine. She was courageous, compassionate and cheerful. I was really surprised at Mari's optimistic nature given her difficult childhood, but I appreciated it all the same. She was great with the children, and even better with the distracted duke. My only hang up with Mari's character was her name... the rhymes-with-starry bit just didn't work with my southern accent, so I called her Mary most of the time.

Edgar Rochester, Duke of Banksford, is an unusual member of the aristocracy. He shunned his title for a period of time and worked as a commoner, and now he is a duke engaging in trade. Specifically, our duke is endeavoring to build a lighter, faster steam engine for use by railways and fire brigades. I admired his determination and self-assurance. Edgar didn't give a whit about society or its ideals, he was trying to make travel easier and cities safer from fire. He also didn't hesitate to acknowledge and accept his illegitimate children when he learned of them, and he appeared quite distraught that their mother hid them from him for so long. While Edgar was self-assured when it came to his work and societal standing, he was vulnerable when it came to his past and his father. I liked this dichotomy in his character and felt it made him more relatable.

This relationship was sweet and uplifting. I loved Mari's banter with the duke - she had some great quips in response to his more overbearing behavior. I liked that the duke was attracted to Mari from the very first, where she saw herself as undesirable with her carrot top and freckles. Through Edgar, Mari's self-esteem grew and she blossomed on the page. Edgar grew as well, realizing that he wasn't his father and didn't need to maintain such strict control all the time.

The Mary Poppins aspect of this story was great. I thought the touches were subtle, but recognizable. When something familiar popped up, it made me nostalgic. Edgar's children were great as well. They were precocious, but also unsure of themselves in their new life. I liked that Mari decided to be a bridge between their old life and new.

I highly recommend this story to any fans of historical romance. I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book that I received from the publisher, Avon.",1522713600,4
8303,134,1964,"We can either die peacefully or survive by any means necessary.

I honestly cant remember how long Ive been waiting for this book and Im so happy to have finally read it! Dread Nation is an epic alternative history tale where the dead began to rise during the American Civil War, effectively ending that battle as a newer threat emerged. Dread Nation is an action-packed thrill from one page to the next that you cant miss.

Things I Liked
I really loved Jane. She is an amazing character - so full of fire, determination, and smarts. Jane is a character you root for because shes so capable and strong, but also yell at for being impulsive and a bit vain. Shes just the greatest.  Also, while there isn't a label given, or a relationship on the page, Jane does say that she had been with/had feelings for both men and women in the past. So we have a WOC on the LGBT+ spectrum in a historical novel!

Kate, the storys second leading character, is equally as fabulous and complex. I liked seeing her as a foil to Jane, not quite as impulsive or brash, but equally as smart and capable. Kate and Jane develop this fantastic friendship that is supportive, caring, and pure. Kate is also an aro/ace character!

I want more historical stories with POC leads and Im so glad that Dread Nation exists. I loved seeing how race was discussed in the time period - and how colorism is a huge part of the racial experience of black Americans. I really like that the story didn't shy away from honest discussions and addressed that even though slavery had ended institutions, like the combat schools which mirror the real-world American Indian boarding schools, have been put in place to see certain racial groups at a disadvantage.

If you know me then you know I love letters  or quotes used as chapter lead-ins in stories. I though the letter excerpts here from both Jane and her mom were great at building their relationship, which is so incredibly important to Jane. They also helped me connect with Janes mom, a character who we never see on page.

Quotes
Its a cruel, cruel world and the people are the worst part.

Lots of different ways to pretty up the same old evils.

Things I Didnt Like
There was 2 distinct parts in the story, and while I LOVED part 1 so much, part 2 wasn't as enjoyable for me personally. I found some of the characters we meet to be more one dimensional or just not as fully developed as I wanted and the plot was a tad bit confusing at times. I also thought the ending was relatively weak. Despite the intense action - it never felt like there was a real threat or the characters were in any real danger. It was all very non-consequential.

Despite my enjoyment fading the teensiest bit, I still enjoyed Dread Nation a whole bunch. With complex characters, intense action, and an important message, this is a new release you cant miss.

8305,255,1958,"First lets talk about the plot.  Tangerine begins in Tangiers, Morocco in 1956.  There is a prologue and epilogue, both in other locales, and the outcome is not revealed until the epilogue.  Two former Bennington roommates re-unite in Tangiers when uninvited Lucy shows up at Alices door.  Husband John arrives soon after and is not pleased to see that they have a guest  their quarters are somewhat cramped and John quickly deduces that this stranger will be cramping his life style as well.  John is a leach of Alices Aunt Maude generosity and while he works  doing what is never made clear  he apparently is unpaid.  Alice is nice, but a doormat;  Lucy is not nice and speaks her mind.  The sun hasn't set before sparks begin to fly, and fly, and fly.  Clearly, this would have made a great black and white Bette Davis uberdrama.

Lucy and Alice narrate alternating chapters.  Sometimes, Alice will give her view of something Lucy has described in the preceding chapter; other times the story will just move on.  Always in the background is Tangier or Tangiers or the other 4 or 5 names history has used for this amazing city with narrow passages through the Casbah, broiling sun, hot mint tea  and the occasional tangerine.  So, whats a tangerine?  Someone whose home is Tangiers, a woman, not Moroccan, a user of people  it is not complimentary.

There are flashbacks to Bennington days, a hint of past trouble, the incident.  A growing relationship between the two woman, despite two polar opposites in background, in personalities, in almost everything.  Jump back to Tangier and we begin to meet some locals.  Lucy is advised to stay away from Youssef, a warning akin to telling a teenager to drive at the speed limit and never experiment with drugs.  The tension continues to mount.  We learn what it was that happened that night at Bennington and why one of the young women ran away.  Identities become blurred.  And then there is a murder.

Why 1956?  The story wouldnt quite work at much later dates. Shortly after, Morocco becomes independent, crime solving becomes more sophisticated, travel advances shrink the globe.  And what about that blurb on the cover suggesting what a great Hitchcock movie this would have made?  I don't agree.  I loved Hitchcock.  But Hitchcock used female roles as window dressing; his films were always about the hero guy.  Hitchcock did not make movies about women.  There is no hero guy in Tangerine; actually there is no heroine either.

And that is why I think there is such a disparity between most reader reviews and critic reviews.  After reading critics reviews, one might expect 5 stars from readers. But most readers, including myself, want a hero, someone they like, someone to pull for, someone to save the day or just survive.  This is not that book.  Nevertheless Tangerine is excellent  for its great story telling, for transporting the reader to an engrossing time and place, for creating two excellent characters, for great tension and plot.  So I highly recommend this book though I realize it is not for all tastes.",1522713600,5
8306,382,1964,"This was a pretty important book. It's beautifully written and full of awesome characters. It tells an important story of racism and how it affects black people. Heartbreaking at times. It's a fantasy historical zombie story, yet so completely real at times too. This book was not perfect to me, so a three star, but I liked it a bunch.

I shall start by saying that I liked the writing in this book a lot. I grew to care for the main character, Jane, a whole lot too. And I loved her voice. And getting to know her was the very best thing, as she was awesome, fierce and brave. She is black, her mom is white, and the world is a whole lot of trouble to her. Oh, my heart.

This story was all kinds of interesting to read about, so important too. I'm not going to be able to describe it well enough at all, but I am going to try a my very best at least. This book takes place in the past, 1800 something. It tells the story of Jane, a girl who has spent the past couple of years studying at a school. Studying to commit murder. As the dead started walking the earth around the time she was born. Everyone are trying their hardest to kill them. Except they are using only black people to do it. The whole story for it is complicated, and heartbreaking. Gosh. They claim slavery is over, because of a war. But I shall have you know that there is a whole lot of slavery in this book, and it was so sad. And honest. And written so well too. My heart hurts from all of it.

I'm not going to write too much about the plot. Only a little bit. There is a bit difference between white and black people in this world. The white think they owns everything, and for the most part they do. And it was all kinds of heartbreaking to read about. Made me so angry too, because so much of this book happens today too, and it is not right. Not right at all. Anyway. There is a lot going on in this story. Some politics, a whole bunch of awful people around too. I won't describe it all. But worth reading for sure. It's interesting.

This book tells the story of Jane. And she was a girl that I loved a whole lot. She is strong. Even when things are going so badly for her. She always wants to fight, and I loved that about her. The beginning of this book shares about how the dead came to be alive and killing people, and how Jane has been at this school learning to kill them. I enjoyed reading about the school a lot, and about how they learned things. Some of the girls she were with were so awesome. I wish there had been more about all of them, though.

We learn so much about Jane. And I loved that so, because she was awesome. We learn about her past boyfriend, Jackson. Whom is mostly not a good boy at all. Yet I could not help but fall in love with him the moment I saw him. Oh, I ship them so much. We meet Katherine too, whom is so rude to Jane at first in the book. But she gets better, and they slowly start to become friends, and I loved that so much. Because Katherine was so fierce and brave and I adored getting to know her so much. They were amazing friends.

There is a lot that I could say about this book. But I don't have the words for it. In the first part of the book, Jane and Katherine are both training to become Attendants, the hired help of rich white ladies. And in the second part of the book, they are mostly kidnapped, and forced almost to be slaves for some awful white men. That sheriff just about killed me, I hated him so much. There is a lot of racism shown in this one. All of it heartbreaking and so real. I wanted the best for Jane and Katherine. So much. They were amazing.

I have to admit that one of the main reasons for why this is a three star for me is the romance. There was not a lot of romance in this book at all. And considering how long it was, that made me so disappointed. Especially when there ended up being two love interests. Ugh. It's not a love triangle. Because no one is together with anyone. But it's annoying. Because I wanted Jane with Jackson, as I adored him beyond words, and I did not like Gideon at all. Shrugs. I feel that might become an issue in book two. I hope not.

Another reason for why this book was not so perfect for me, was because of how incredibly boring it was most of the time. Yes, the writing is gorgeous, and I adored Jane and Katherine, but I did not care for how boring things were so often. Almost nothing happened. I wanted more action. More romance, more dead people, aka shamblers. I wanted to be more terrified. But despite that, this was an important book, and I did like it a whole lot. I just wish it had been better with the fantasy parts and such. It was not fully for me.

Dread Nation was a book that I'm glad to have read. It was not perfect, but it was also incredibly amazing and good to read. I cannot wait for book two. Huge thank you to HarperCollins International for sending me a free ARC copy of this book to read and review. Feeling so thankful. And I'm glad I had the chance to read this book. I'm so excited for the next one. Hopefully it will be amazing, as I'm nervous too. I think that everyone should read this book. As it is important and amazing too. I just did not fully love it. Almost did.

8307,275,1966,"All the Beautiful Lies by Peter Swanson is a suspenseful mystery that features a few taboo relationships.

Harry Ackerson is days away from his college graduation when his stepmother, Alice, phones with the distressing news that his father has died. He rushes home to help plan the funeral where he quickly learns his fathers death might not have been an accident. Catching sight of a stranger at his fathers funeral, Harry cannot help but wonder what connection the lovely young woman might have to his father. It turns out Grace McGowan knew his dad through his bookstore, but Harry wonders if there might be more to their relationship than she is revealing.  Before he can uncover the truth, Alice points the police in the direction of another employee at her husbands bookstore, but Harry is not quite convinced her accusation holds merit. Before long, another person is murdered, Harry grows uncomfortable with Alices attention and he cannot help but wonder if he knows anyone as well as he thinks.

Harry is not overly sophisticated, a bit naive and he is quickly in over his head where his stepmother is concerned. After his father and Alice married, he was uncomfortable with his inappropriate sexual awareness of his new stepmother and he has spent little time in her company in the years since he left for college.  Staying with her at his fathers house, Harry tries to stay out of her way but Alice does everything she can to engineer time together.  As he grows more certain his father might have been murdered, Grace casts suspicion on Alice but Harry harbors doubt she was involved.

Flashbacks to Alices teen years do not exactly paint her in a flattering light. Her father was never in her life and her mother was an alcoholic who did not marry Alices stepfather Jake Richter until her daughter was in her late teens. Alice makes her own luck and she is somewhat ruthless when crossed.  She follows her heart even though there are few people who would condone her relationship with the man she chooses.

All the Beautiful Lies is an intriguing mystery with a slow moving storyline, unappealing characters and shudder inducing relationships. Set on the Maine coast, the setting is beautifully rendered and springs vibrantly to life through Peter Swansons descriptive prose.  The investigation into the death of Harrys father is interesting and the perpetrators identity is cleverly concealed until the novels twist-filled conclusion.

8308,457,1966,"SOMEBODY WANTED: (You better hold onto your hats, ladies and gents). There are a few characters that want to engage in taboo relationships. They are socially ostracized because of vast age differences and the fact that the participants are sometimes related! As in step parent/step child. Ick. Ick. Ick. There is also a clear cut case of Mrs. Robinson carrying on with a teenage boy. As usual, Swanson has come up with some dark characters living blissfully in their own corrupted world.

BUT: Of course, when normal-minded people have suspicions about these abnormal relationships carrying on, they tend to interfere.

SO: Since the rational world interferes with the corrupted world, the unbalanced characters become completely unhinged while protecting their own sweet spot and well, WORLDS COLLIDE!!!

There you have it, people. An elementary synopsis of a complicated, layered plot!

And, just a few more words, if I may: This is a compulsive, addictable read. Swanson just keeps getting darker and more forbidden with his plots, next thing you know he'll turn into Gillian Flynn (Haaaa, just kidding, there is no one else residing at the level of our lovely dark goddess, GF).

As usual, Swanson writes in a delicious, breezy way. This story is set on the coast of Maine with all the foreshadowing and dangerous mood that accompanies the angry sea. All of his books are clever puzzles with messy edges. At the heart of his novels lies the most basic of human urges: greed. Sometimes the main character is all about the money, money, money.

In this, Swansons latest, the main characters are driven by sex, not money. And, if you know Swanson, you know this isn't going to be everyday lust, he has to pull down that murky shade and create an illicit, evil scenario. LET ME WARN YOU: ALL BOUNDARIES ARE CROSSED.

I wish I could give 5 stars, but I can't only because it was a bit predictable to me. Im starting to see a plot pattern in his novels. However, I still love this one!!

This is Swansons fourth novel and he is extremely consistent in the psychological thriller genre. ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LIES reminds me most of The Girl with a Clock for a Heart, mainly due to the slightly clueless, but lovable, protagonist.

All the women in this novel are strong and richly defined, definitely Swanson's strength. I highly recommend... with reservations because of the subject matter.",1522713600,4

8310,660,1400,"This book is the perfect example of why you sometimes need to give a book a little more than fifty pages to work its magic.

The story opens with the world going to hell in a handbasket but its ever so subtle. Parts of the world are okay but some parts have discovered a problem with how babies are developing in the womb. Although the markets still have food available and many seem to notice little in the way of change, there is an uncomfortable need to grab what you can and go.

Cedar, watching all of this unfold on the news is in a delicate situation. Shes pregnant and shes beginning to realize that pregnant woman are being taken in for examination and its during this point in the story that I suddenly realized that some of the babies in question have reverted to their original state of primate. Erdrich never once comes out and says it but in between the lines, you know whats going on.

The story revolves around Cedar, her birth mother and her adopted mother and how all three of them play a role in her survival. As the government closes in, they are forced to hide in order to protect the baby and in doing so, become part of a larger movement to save these women and their babies.

This was a suspenseful read with some interesting supporting characters. Once the story got going, I had a really hard time putting the book down. I HAD to know how it all turned out and anytime  someone steps in to control a womans body, you can bet that theres plenty of content to discuss.

If youve read Erdrich before youll recognize her style right away but this book will also remind you of The Handmaids Tale and Brave New World.

This would make an excellent book club read.",1522713600,4

8312,756,1505,"My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:
  1. Im in a coma.
  2. My husband doesnt love me anymore.
  3. Sometimes I lie.

  Amber wakes up in a hospital. She cant move. She cant speak. She cant open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesnt remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe its the truth?

In between these narratives, we read diary entries from the early 1990s.

I thought I knew who was writing in those diaries, but the truth was not revealed until almost the end.

Even the identity of our primary narrator was turned upside down, and as we approached the conclusion, some things started clearing up in my mind. Suddenly I felt completely gobsmacked, as I flipped from one reality to another. Throughout, I couldn't decide just who to trustand I wondered if I could trust any of the characters.

By the end, I kept holding my breath, waiting for the final reveal that would clarify everything. But the waters remained muddy enough, and even on the final page, I had to keep asking myself what just happened? A story that kept me pondering its twists and turns. 5 stars.",1522713600,5

8315,864,1965,"I was really anticipating this book. I had enjoyed Americas First Daughter, the book these same authors wrote about Patsy Jefferson (who makes an appearance in this novel.) It is certainly delightful learning about the countrys Founding Fathers through the eyes of the women closest to them. This book tells Alexander Hamiltons story but it is very much Elizas book.

It is delightfully hefty book that allows the reader to sit down and truly get immersed in the subjects of the tale. The problem faced by the authors as they explained in the note at the end is that there was very little left in the historical record specifically about Eliza. Its as if the men in her life sucked up all that would be remembered and left only crumbs for her. Given the times in which she came of age and the company she kept I suppose it could be understood. When your father is fighting to found your country and your husband is molding it  what is left for you? It also wasn't exactly a time that revered the efforts of women was it? The authors had to rely upon those crumbs and then do what fiction writers do  imagine.

Imagine they did using their extensive research and knowledge of the era. But while this is Elizas story, Hamilton does overwhelm her as soon as he appears in the pages. From the moment they are introduced it is all about him. I cant say that I liked him. I also cant say that I have much to compare this characterization t0 so I don't know if it is accurate to his personality or not. He did suck the air out of any room he was in and even after he was dead it was Hamilton, Hamilton, Hamilton.

Eliza was apparently a very devoted wife.

It was a very good read, as annoyed as I got at Mr. Hamilton. I also wonder how this country survived its first few decades. I really need to do more reading of American history. The story of Eliza, so dedicated to her husband and to her country is a fascinating look at the woman behind the man who did so much for a country that did not always respect him or his ideas. It is very much worth reading.

I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

Harry has a mystery on his hands. With the death of his father, he comes home and now has a mystery to solve. His step mom is hiding something, his family friend is hiding something and there is a new person hanging around who is trying to solve the same mystery as Harry, but for a very different reason.

This has a great mystery. While I wish that Harry had more personality, his flashbacks were helpful in figuring out part of the mystery. I really liked his friend, and wished he was more part of the story since he gave off more personality and flare than Harry.

Without giving away the mystery, you could see it play out slowly and like a train wreck you cant look away from, despite the predictability, it was still entertaining.",1522800000,4
8317,494,1964,"Dread Nation is an enjoyable read - Pride, Prejudice, and Zombies but exchanging an historic for a literary inspiration. In other words, this is your typical YA alternative universe, with instalust, kickbutt heroine who is unfortunately highly unrealistic, and plenty of imaginative adventure. I did not love Dread Nation but it was a nice way to pass the time.

Story: The Civil War ended and the dead rose soon after. Whole cities were decimated by the 'plague' of zombies. Former slaves and native Indians were considered inferior and rounded up and sent to combat schools to protect the white population. Jane McKee is the daughter of a white woman and black man - and therefore was among those rounded up to learn combat. She excels despite the overt prejudice against her until she and her friends uncover a plot with huge and widespread ramifications.

The premise is sound and the author draws upon history nicely rather than superficially. From the language and mores of the antebellum era that persisted even after the war to the way that Indians and blacks were treated. The story takes place in Baltimore, Maryland, as the US is falling apart due to the ever increasing numbers of zombies.

Our heroine, Jane, is strong willed but highly pragmatic. She has no problem killing and I'm glad the author didn't shy away from giving her a more period-appropriate shifting moral compass. The first part of the book is about learning to fight and interacting with city folk. The second half is a zombie Western of survival and desperation. Although most will appreciate Jane's ability to think clearly in emergencies and to survive/persevere, I admittedly felt at times that she was written too strongly - I just didn't feel that this is a person who would have, in reality, survived in the situations she was placed. So although the book is very grounded in facts from the period, I just didn't believe in Jane as being a true character.

The writing is a bit choppy and doesn't flow. It felt more like a series of vignettes - fight here, make friend here, meet old flame here, lust after sexy doctor there. Each chapter is headed by a letter to Jane's family or from Jane's family, which gave a nice introduction to what we'd find inside. The side characters were interesting and again, we didn't have one dimensional good or evil characters; each was following their own needs/wants/desires.

The messages and morals are heavy here. If you don't mind a complete and utter lack of subtlety then you won't have a problem with Dread Nation. If, on the other hand, you get tired of being beat over the head with certain themes about the wrongs of the times, the book can get tedious. Author Ireland makes good points but she does it just a bit too emphatically and repeatedly.

In all, it's a fun romp along the lines of Pride, Prejudice, and Zombies - but with a black Scarlett O'Hara/Gone With The Wind feeling instead. Because the author didn't have to be slavish to a novel, she had more free reign with characters and characterizations. Reviewed from an advance reader copy provided by the publisher.",1522800000,4
8318,47,1391,"Gorgeous fantasy set in the middle east. The story took a bit for me to get into. I didn't like any of the characters for quite some time, but did end up entirely swept up in their lives and loving it by the end.",1522800000,4
8319,310,1964,"This. Was. Fun. Wicked fun.

Who knew an alternate history story involving slavery, the Civil War era, racism, a biracial MC, and ZOMBIES would be so damn fun? I have not had a book make me cackle with such evil glee in a long while. Where do I even start?

A virus of unknown origin has been turning people into zombies, or as they are known in Janes world, shamblers. Black, white, rich, poor, doesnt matter, you get bit, you're doomed to be a shambler. While this phenom has basically replaced the Civil War, slavery and racism are still a fact of life in the south but instead of picking cotton, slaves are schooled to fight the shamblers.

While still a young girl, Jane was taken against the wishes of her mother, the widowed owner of the plantation where she lives, and placed in one of the higher quality academies. No matter how you look at it, Jane may be acing defense class but she is failing everything else, especially the art of dealing with her teachers and the headmistress. She is actually quite good at infuriating them, breaking rules and crossing lines.

And then there is Katherine. Katherine is a beautiful, light-skinned classmate of fine breeding that makes Jane stupid with envy. I had a bit of trouble with this dynamic at first because the only reason Jane doesnt like Katherine is because she is beautiful and I was hoping Jane was not that shallow.

Turns out shes not.

Midway through the book, Jane and Katherines story takes a strange, unhappy turn and they are forced to leave the school where at the academy the dominant enemy was a shambler. Where they end up, it's the white men who are the enemy.

There are so many elements of this book that make it absolutely entertaining. Jane is sassy and smart and fearless and wicked deadly with her duel scythes. The narrative is told from her point of view and I loved the southern-fried vernacular and homespun wisdom. Throughout the book there are unanswered letters from Jane to her mother that reflect the mood of the story. There is the mystery of Janes father, a black field hand. Friendships are cemented. Enemies are made. And shamblers litter the landscape.

I loved the battle scene with the slaves singing like they would in the fields picking cotton, but this time, they are slaying zombies. In rhythm to the song.

Throughout the story, the author reminds the reader that while Jane is a free spirit she is still a slave. The whites treat her and the other slaves like dirt and chattel. They exist only to fight the shamblers with only dull knives and rusty machetes provided by the whites. A dead or zombified slave is easily replaceable.

There are twists throughout the book, some expected, some a total surprise, but the last one leaves the reader begging for more. I cannot wait for the next book.

Many, many thanks to Edelweiss for this ARC. All opinions are my own.",1522800000,5
8320,567,1957,"My first book by Ms. Bell, but definitely not my last!

What a Difference a Duke Makes was a fun and swoony read--and a bit of a mashup of Mary Poppins and Jane Eyre to boot :) Both Mari and Edgar a atypical for their time--he's a duke who (gasp!) also engages in trade and she's got about three times the backbone and chutzpah of your typical governess--but goodness, they're just so likable as a hero and heroine. Their initial attraction, though not wholly surprising, does manifest itself a bit abruptly (literally minutes into their first meeting he thinks about cutting her corset laces off of her) but once they get to know each other better it becomes absolutely believable. Throw his 9-year-old twins into the mix and it's pretty much impossible not to root for them with all you've got.

I loved--as did Edgar, obviously--the way that Mari constantly took the duke to task for the choices he was making and the mistaken beliefs that had been governing his life up to that point. She ends up being exactly what he and his children need in their lives, which (fortunately) makes things that much easier for her when her ""big secret"" is finally revealed. Things quickly come together in the end to bring them all a super-adorable HEA (too quickly and easily? Maybe, but I'm not going to complain one bit because seriously, this was so. Much. Fun. To. Read) that left me with a smile on my face as I quickly clicked the ""want to read"" button on the next book in the series. (India and Ravenwood--yessssssss! Hapshetsut FTW, people!)

The writing was choppy at times and I'm sure historical accuracy took a backseat more than once, but honestly the characters and story were so engaging that I barely noticed. I can't wait to see what Ms. Bell has in store for future series characters!

8322,1073,1954,"Sheltered heiress Evangeline Chandler knows who she wants- bad boy Gabe Hunter.
The problem? She has no idea what to do about it. She thinks that Gabe doesn't notice her at all. He is 12 years her senior, her older brother's friend, and he thinks of her as the ""Baby Chandler"". Eve was raised by an emotionally abusive father and has learned to hide her true feelings in order to keep up appearances. In an act of rebellion, Eve becomes ""Anne""- the Lyft driver, in order to research her very private business plan, and also to spend time chatting with Gabe while in disguise.

Gabe Hunter is a tattoo artist who was raised by the housekeeper of the Kane family. He grew up alongside both the Kanes and the Chandlers, and he carries a painful family secret. He also harbors a secret crush on Eve, but he feels that he is all wrong for her.
Gabe and Eve are part of the wedding party for Eve's brother Nick and Gabe's co-worker Livvy. They end up spending several days alone together in the country estate where the wedding is going to take place. Things go from slow burn to raging inferno as their relationship changes from friends to lovers.
But can their passion survive the secrets they both hide...?

It was so great to watch Eve grow and change throughout the book. She overcomes her insecurities to go from a timid, sheltered girl into a self-assured, empowered woman. Her analogy of poking her head out of a turtle shell in order to be daring really helped me to visualize her struggle- and I loved that she gives herself permission to hold on to the shell in case she ever needs to duck into it for self protection. I do think the whole ""Anne"" Lyft driver thing where she semi-stalked Gabe and tricked him into talking about himself was a bit odd.
Gabe was a very sexy hero- his dirty talking was off the charts hot! I loved how supportive he was of Eve, and how he encouraged her to shed her insecurities and become the sexy, self-assured woman she wanted to be.
There was an additional family drama that concluded in the book. Having not read the first two books, I was still able to follow along. I do feel that I would have been a bit more emotionally invested in the peripheral characters if I had read the first two books in the series, but I was still drawn into the emotional story.
Overall, I was impressed with the character depth of this sweet, sexy romance.

8323,1068,1893,"It pains so badly to write this review because this was one of the most anticipated reads for me. Unfortunately the stars did not align.

Seventeen-year old Ana is a space pirate who doesn't remember much of her past. She was found with a Metal named DI, basically a robot, floating through space after a massacre at the Iron Kingdom. Those who know the story of Anastasia will know that she was the missing missing survivor, but lived her life without any memory of her past.

What bent me out of shape from the start was the disconnect I felt from almost every POV and there are several. After the first 100 pages I decided that I probably won't be caring much about these characters at all because I didn't feel as though I was taught to. The one I felt the least connected to was Ana, which was the most disappointing to me because SHE IS THE PROTAGONIST. ugh

So, being disconnected to the people I wanted to care about, I fell into a mode where nothing truly made a lot of sense and it was sort of jumbled for me. I didn't feel as though anything was really that exciting. I felt as though a lot needed to be fleshed out and never got the chance to.

This, as well as the numerous typos I found throughout the book just through me for a loop. I mean, i expect that from indie books, not from something like this.

I did like the diversity and it was a breath of fresh air for me. The cover and stained pages in the Owlcrate edition are gorgeous.",1522800000,3
8324,621,1893,"This is not an Anastasia retelling. It is inspired by Anastasia those are two very different things and I don't want people to be misled before going into the book and have it negatively affect their opinion. If it was retelling we wouldve met Anastasia as a small child and progressed through the book until we finally saw her entire family murdered. That is more or less where history ends because despite the research no one truly knows what happened to Anastasia. Many believe that she died that day with her family, but those optimistic few take it upon themselves to create a happier story for her.

Heart of iron is a continuation of the lost princesses story. It is a what if. What if she escaped that day? What if she was picked up by a group of space pirates and found her family there? It is a unique way to take the story of Anastasia and continue it The way that the author hopes the real story may have ended (other than the fact that this is science fiction and to my knowledge the Romanovs didn't own a spaceship.)

We enter a world in which we never expected Anastasia to find her home. Going into the book knowing that it is inspired by Anastasia - no one is going to be surprised by who the lost Princess is. Thats not the point of the story.

Instead, we delve into a sci-fi world populated by rogues, rebels, and royalty. I felt that the idea of the book is much more intriguing than the final product ending up being. Even though I really enjoyed the story, I wasn't as invested as I should have been.

I cared more about Robb and Jax, than I did about the main character Ana or her best friend Di. I liked them, but I wish they were developed more. I think that would have helped me form a connection with them.

The main arc of the story plays out over the course of the novel and felt like it could have easily been a stand-alone. Instead, there is this plot point that is introduced to set up future adventures and strife. I was hoping for more with this story, but it definitely an easy, fun sci-fi book that has very little depth to it.",1522800000,4

My father died of bladder cancer and watching him suffer was very hard. Therefore, you can understand I don't usually read books on the topic and yet I read ""The Fault of Our Stars"" twice, which should tell you something.

8329,1029,1957,"I love Mari (rhymes with starry). She's this perfect blend of Mary Poppins and Anne Shirley, and I want her to be my new best friend. Lenora Bell performs magic with every novel, and I love how she weaves elements from books and movies in pop culture into her Regency romance setting. Bell said she drew on inspiration from Mary Poppins for What a Difference a Duke Makes and it's so fun finding the little pops of inspiration when you know what to look for. Some great examples are Mari's frothy white dress with the crimson sash that is reminiscent of Mary Poppins' iconic ""jolly holiday"" dress from the movie; Mari makes up a story about someone named Bert; the lawyer's name is Albert, the same as Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (a coincidence? Not in a Lenora Bell novel!) There's a part in Albert Shadwell's office where Mari takes note of pattern on the carpet - urns with red and blue roses. I am certain this has some sort of meaning or connection to something, I'm not just bright enough to connect the dots. But if Bell put it there, I'm sure it means something!

I haven't seen anything official that mentions a connection to Anne Shirley (of Anne of Green Gables fame) but I'm so sure Bell must have drawn on inspiration from this character by L.M. Montgomery. In addition to her general appearance, Mari insists her name is Mari (with an ""i"") just like Anne (with an ""e""), and she even makes a reference to ""scope for the imagination"" at one point. There are a few other clues in there as well, but I'll let you find them for yourself.

I'm in danger of this review becoming as long as the book itself, so I'll wrap it up. In addition to being (clearly) enamored of the leading lady, the other characters are also superb. I appreciate Banksford's drive and his desire to care for his family (as well as his confusion about to how to that love he feels). India is an amazing woman and I can't wait to read about her in the next book in this series. The twins, Adele and Michel, are precocious and so sweet, and I hope we get to see how they're getting on in later books in the series as well. I love Lenora Bell's writing style; the book is well-researched, feels authentic to the period (as far as I can tell as a reader who enjoys Regency romance and doesn't inspect them with a grimace through my quizzing glass), the plot is well thought out and pleasingly paced, and the dialogue is in turns witty and endearing. I am a huge fan of Lenora Bell and this had pretty high expectations for this book, and I was definitely not disappointed. Now I just need to wait (ever impatiently!) for the next book in the series, For the Duke's Eyes Only.",1522886400,5

There's really nothing I didn't enjoy about this book. Both the heroine and hero are smart, funny, and kind, the children are adorable (kids can be annoying in a lot of books), and the secondary characters are developed just enough to add depth (and often humor) to the main story rather than distract from it.

Lenora Bell is an auto-buy for me. If you're looking for lighthearted romances with lots of smart humor, I can't recommend her enough.",1522886400,5
8331,237,819,"Every review of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW that I read was a great one. So I tried it. Although I do criticize it, I give it four out of five stars because this book, after 140 pages, is difficult to put down and, when I had to put it down, made me anxious to pick it back up. Please read the first 140 pages. This is one of those books that's worth what seems like too much buildup.

The woman in THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, Anna Fox, lives alone in a great big house that she never leaves. She spends her days online or watching DVDs of old movies or keeping an eye on her neighbors from her window.

I was immediately reminded of REAR WINDOW, one of the old movies in Foxs collection. Even though THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is updated with more recent technology, Fox still uses a camera with a telephoto lens, just like Jimmy Stewart. I knew then, Fox, like Stewart in REAR WINDOW, is looking for trouble.

Along with that prediction, I easily predicted a couple of other mysteries in THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. But the book is still thrilling because it contains other mysteries that I didn't predict. For this reason, I am careful not to discuss particulars. Enjoy this book: discover the mysteries as they occur in the book rather than anticipate them because I told you to.

One comment, though: A.J. Finn, the author of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, uses the best device to show me how bad the bad guy ishurt the cat.",1522886400,4
8332,245,1967,"Watched Little House as a kid, but was never a fanatic or a big fan of Nellie Oleson, but who was? However, this book written by the woman who played Nellie, is really well done - i won't give away any spoilers, but the book is funny, touching and enlightening.  Most celeb books stink (i know, i've wasted too much time on too many of them, but this one is really good and Allison's story is interesting and engaging.

Relatively quick read though, so that is the only downside.",1522886400,4
8333,132,1933,"It's no secret that I'm a Jesse Ball fanatic. I think he's one of the most exciting living writers. I hold his novels on a high pedestal, and find that he is unmatched in his ability to write surreal, experimental, abstract, yet still accessible works of fiction.

I liked Census quite a bit, but it's not the most intellectually exciting Ball novel, nor is it one that I would recommend to first-time Ball readers. Like most of his other books, there's a sense of mystery and unknowing, but the difference is that it remains largely unresolved. It's not the point. The characters (a father and his son with Down syndrome) are the point.

The father, knowing he is dying, gives up his job as a doctor and becomes a census taker so that he and his son can spend time together on the road. It's unclear what the point of the census is in Ball's world. It's different than how we know itit's mysterious, perhaps authoritarian. But again, none of that is really the point.

As the father and son travel the county, they meet different people. Each town they enter, each person they meet serves as a sort of parable for human experience. There's not a lot of narrative here, mainly disparate encounters.

Ball wrote Census as a tribute to his brother with Down syndrome, who died when he was still young. You can feel that this is personal for him. Tenderness and sincerity fill every page.

Never do we learn the true purpose of the strange and elusive census, apart from what the father gains from it. Through the census, he explores the essence of life, humanity, and goodness. He copes with his own mortality, and with the gravity of leaving his son in this world alone.

A blurb on the back of Census described Ball's world view as ""tender nihilism,"" and this is indeed a fitting description. Census is deeply meditative and moving; though not one of Ball's more bizarre and intellectually stunning stories, it's quietly profound and emotionally resonant.",1522886400,5
8334,972,1924,"It was so good to revisit this world and these characters. It felt very familiar, yet also so fresh and new. You could easily tell how much Mafi's writing has grown and changed in terms of story-telling, but I was very happy that she still kept some of the awesomeness that I loved in the original series.

In a lot of ways, this felt like a ""first book"" in a series, as not a lot truly happens. Even though it's been years for us readers, it's only been two weeks for these characters. It makes sense that most of the book was just the characters adjusting and reacting to the revolution. While I was hoping for more, I understood why there wasn't and I wasn't ever bored, so that's good.

I loved that we got Warner's POV in this book and I hope that continues throughout the series. Juliette is very much a stranger to this new world she's in charge of and very naive, so it's nice to see it all through Warner's eyes and get his perspective on it. I will say that I wish he would've gotten over himself more and communicated better. Seriously, if there's one complaint, it's the lack of communication between Warner and Juliette, and honestly, with all of the characters. Granted, most of them are teens, but still. So much drama could've been avoided.

The ending was pretty awesome, although I saw that twist coming a mile away. It was blatantly obvious even before I read the book what was going to happen and what was going to be revealed. It was too rushed, however, and I didn't get a chance to absorb what was happening before the book just ended. Ugh, cliffhangers!

The book is good and it definitely has me wanting to read the next one. Most of the time when authors try to continue a series, it's totally unnecessary and falls flat, but in this case, Mafi did an amazing job. Not only that, it honestly works because we only got Juliette's story in the present, her escaping and her self-discovery, but there was truly so much more story to tell.",1522886400,5
8335,275,1968,"Cave of Bones by Anne Hillerman is a perplexing mystery with several cases to solve. This 22nd installment in the Leaphorn, Chee & Manuelito series can easily be read as a standalone.

Tribal police officer Bernadette Bernie Manuelito is only supposed to be giving a talk to the participants of the Wings and Roots program. However, she quickly becomes embroiled in a case in which teenager Annie Rainsong goes missing and staff member Domingo Dom Cruz who is searching for her, has also disappeared. Annie eventually returns unharmed but Dom is nowhere to be found.  Since Annie is prone to exaggerating, no one but Bernie believes her claims that she found bones in the cave she took refuge in overnight.  Bernie is soon swept up in several seeming disparate investigations involving the Wings and Roots program, Doms search and rescue and possible grave robbing of Native American artifacts.

Bernies husband, Sergeant Jim Chee, is in Santa Fe for training and he grows concerned for his sister-in-law Darleen who is attending  a class at the Institute of American Indian Arts. He is worried that she might be in trouble with her boyfriend Clayton CS Secody whose furtive actions make Jim suspicious. Equally dismaying is the discovery that CS is involved with Clyde Herbert, a felon that Jim put behind bars.  Jim is afraid Darleen is in over her head since she is unwilling to discuss what is going on with her, CS and Herbert.

Both Bernie and Jim turn to Lt. Joe Leaphorn for background on some of the principals they encounter on their respective investigations. Although Joe still has a few memory issues from being shot, he remains sharp as a tack.  He augments his  recollections with some research that turns up some very unexpected revelations.

Cave of Bones is a mesmerizing police procedural that takes a few startling twists and turns. The cases are quite interesting and in addition to a wily group of suspects, Bernie must also battle the elements in her quest for answers.  Anne Hillermans descriptive prose brings the New Mexico landscape and Native American culture vividly to life.  The novel comes to a satisfying conclusion that neatly wraps all of the story arcs. This latest addition to the Leaphorn, Chee & Manuelito series is sure to be hit with fans of the genre.

8336,660,70,"I had been avoiding this book when it was selected by my book club. Truthfully, I wasn't interested in it because I knew it would hit too close to home, and it did. I didn't grow up in the same region as Vance but I could identify with nearly everything Vance encountered growing up: addiction, abuse, poverty, and having what seemed like no other options for living.

But I could also identify with a need to belong, a need to succeed and the well-meaning intentions of some of the folks around me. Vance tells his story with brutal honestly but his story is peppered with hope throughout, which makes this memoir a very interesting read about the long-term effects of class decline on future generations and it begs the question, how can we fix it?

The full impact of this memoir didn't hit me until the last third of the book. That is when Vance gets to the point. The never-ending cycle of poverty for some, make it impossible for them to rise above it. How could they without the realization that there is more out there?  If the norm is poverty and abuse, and its all they see, what motivation exists to change their situation for the better?

I know some people will argue with that logic. That people have a choice and they choose to be poor but for many, they grew up that way. They were never shown or given the opportunity to live differently. Vance suggests that the people who manage to pull themselves out of this cycle are the ones who were introduced to something different. I agree. Its the number one reason why I work with teens and the homeless. I had people in my life that showed me a different way and that made all the difference. I want to be that person to someone else.

Hillbilly Elegy is a powerful read and if you don't want to read it or think you cant relate to it in some way, try, because its important to know how other people live. For our society to flourish we need role models to show us a better way because no matter where you stand politically, brokenness is evident all around us if you look.",1522886400,4
8337,319,1965,"Alexander Hamiltons legacy would have sadly been left by the wayside if not for the work of his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton.  A brave woman in her own right, Eliza was the daughter of a Major General, adopted by the Oneida tribe, the mother of eight children, and founder of two orphanages in New York City.  She helped her husband with his work and if anything was his right hand woman.  Eliza finally gets her own story told in a splendid new historical fiction novel, My Dear Hamilton.

My Dear Hamilton tells Elizas story from her teenage years until her death with the major focus being on her turbulent life with Alexander Hamilton.  Their great love endured even with the first major political sex scandal and the untimely death of their son.

I love reading historical fiction and its always a delight to read historical fiction on Americas past.  Ive read Americas First Daughter by the same authors and have enjoyed that as well.  I love listening to the music from the musical Hamilton and would love to see it live.  Authors Dray and Kamoie love the musical as well and it was the musical that inspired them to write the book from Elizas point of view.

I really liked how the story was framed with an elderly Eliza receiving a visit from former President James Monroe.  The book gave a history to their story together and why Eliza would not forgive him.

 really enjoyed that the novel included the Oneida people and how they were affiliated with Elizas family, Americas struggle for freedom, and with Alexander Hamilton himself as he started a school for the tribe.  It was poignant towards the end of the book when Marquis de Lafayette came to visit and asked about the tribe only to be told they had been driven out.  Part of the tribe is actually not far from me in Green Bay.  They traveled through the Great Lakes and found a new homeland in Wisconsin, but its still a struggle today for the tribe to keep their tribal land.

Slavery is also a side story in the book with Elizas family owning slaves.  I always forget that people did own slaves in the North at the start of our country.  For example, poet Phyllis Wheatly was a slave in New York City.  Eliza and multiple founding fathers struggle with this issue. The authors discuss at the end of the book in their note that the revolutionary war wasn't just fought by white men in powdered wigs, there were people of all races involved.  I appreciated that real look at history.

The book really brought the founding fathers alive and how they all struggle and had issues with each other.  One thing Ive found personally interesting is that in books, movies, and the musical, its always framed that Hamilton is a hero and Jefferson a villain or Jefferson is the hero and Hamilton is a villain.  I think it was much greyer than that.  Both men did a lot to create our country and make it what it is today, and both men were far from perfect with great sins of their own to contemplate.

As a wife and mother, Ill admit, I had a hard time with Elizas forgiveness of Hamilton after the affair was discovered before his death.  I dont
know if I could be that forgiving.  I liked that after Hamiltons death, Eliza struggled a lot after she read through his personal correspondence wondering if he had loved her after all and had a very hard time forgiving him.  It wasn't until after a candid talk with Lafayette that she could learn to move on and love the man he was even with all of his flaws.

Lafayettes trip later in life back to America was riveting to read about.  I also was amazed that in her eighties Eliza traveled to the wilds of Wisconsin to visit her son.  I cant imagine in that time period traveling out to that far and returning when in your eighties!

I LOVED the extras as the back of the book.  It included a note from the author about the actual history the book was based on, discussion questions, a conversation with the authors, and how the book differs from the musical.

Favorite Quotes:

Forgetting would lift the weighty cloak of the past from my shoulders and make the present so much easier.  But memory unalterably sets our compass and guides us down paths we might have preferred never to have walked at all.

As if the notion that all men were created equal somehow meant that one need not aspire to knowledge and ability  all distinctions of class, breeding, or merit discarded, all notions of civility deserted.

I hadnt married a man.  Id married a mythic hero whod driven a carriage of the sun across the sky.  No other husband could ever measure up against my dear Hamilton, and it would be cruel to make any man try.

He was not a perfect man.  But he was a great one.  It is only plain justice that his wife should remember him better.  And his country, too.

It seems, to me that the only just way to judge a person is by the sum of their deeds, good and bad.

Overall, My Dear Hamilton was a riveting read about one of our nations founding mothers and the start of our country. What makes a person remembered and can they still be a good person even with serious flaws?  I'll admit some of my favorite parts were actually in the excellent author notes and extras in the end.

8339,496,1958,"{My Thoughts}
What Worked For Me
Dual Narration  Alternating narrators is one of my favorite literary devices and debut author Christine Mangan used it beautifully, creating an aura of mystery and a sense of doubt that kept me guessing. In the books epilogue, Alice begins telling her story from a hospital in Spain. Shes recalling a woman she both wants to remember and forget. That woman is Lucy who arrives on Alices doorstep in Tangier completely unannounced. Her arrival is as welcome as it is unwelcome, for these two women share a dark history that both are hinting at.

And so there were days when I never wanted to part from her, when I felt that my whole being depended upon my close connection with her. And there were days when I hated her, resenting myself, resenting her for this reliance, this symbiotic relationship that we had formed  though on the darkest days I wondered whether it really was, whether there was anything that I had to offer her, and whether what she offered me wasn't more a crutch than a benefit.

As they move through their days and nights in Tangier, the mystery of what happened during their senior year of college is slowly revealedfrom both perspectives. Neither narrator is particularly reliable. Alice, confused, timid, and vulnerable sees the world through the fog of her own mind; Lucy sees it only as she wants it to be, willing to get there by any means possible.

Growing Darkness  As you might have already guessed, Lucy is one dark woman. Initially, I found myself drawn to her gumption and fearlessness. She was willing to spend every last penny she had and travel halfway around the world to go after what she wanted. She wasn't put off by being alone in a strange land or by John, Alices husband, who clearly wanted her gone. As Tangerine progressed, more and more of Lucy emerged. She was oh so good at putting herself first, no matter the collateral damage.

Secrets  Tangerine revolves around two big secrets. The first is glimpsed in that epilogue where we meet Alice in the hospital. Questions immediately arise. Why is she there? What happened in Tangier? Where is her husband? What role did Lucy play? Each chapter of the book takes you closer and closer to understanding. From the start, Alice and Lucy both allude to the second secret: tragedy at Bennington College. When it finally became clear I found myself questioning the sanity of both women.

What Didnt
Central Casting  The primary characters in Tangerine, Alice, Lucy and John, all felt like they were straight out of central casting. Each was a type, a very usual type. Not one of them ever varied from that type. I wish there had been more of a surprise element in how their individual stories were resolved. It would have been nice to see something a little different, rather than well-established, pat characters. I think it will be very interesting to see what Hollywood does with Mangans characters.

Slow and Languid  Alices narration in particular fell on the slow side and I found myself drifting a bit in her parts.

{The Final Assessment}
Tangerine is the latest of several noir style books that have come out this year, and for me it ranks about the same as the rest, not a knockout, but very good. The trip to Tangier in 1956 was fun and the story easy to read. I was always eager to get back to the story and find out what had happened to Alice and how she ended up in that Spanish hospital. Had the characters been a little less expected, a little more memorable, it easily would have risen higher in my esteem. Grade: B",1522886400,4

8341,494,1924,"As much as I enjoyed the other books in this series, I had a hard time with Restore Me. It felt like the entire book was the following scene ad nauseum:
Juliet: ""I'm not sure what to do.""
Warner: ""I'm so in love with Juliet, it hurts.""
Juliet: ""I'm not sure what to do now.""
Warner: ""Juliet is so beautiful, it's painful""
Juliet: ""What do I do know - I am not sure.""
Warner: ""Juliet is my world, she's so perfect.""

I kept waiting for a plot to kick in but it was pretty much a love letter to those fans who wanted more Warner mooning over Juliet.  Fortunately, we had some great scenes with Kenji again - he's always a welcome injection of self effacing humor to keep us from taking the situations too seriously.  But there wasn't enough Kenji to go around to offset the saccharine romance.

In addition, it gets tiring to have everyone, including all the enemies, falling in love with Juliet instead of disliking or destroying her.  Yet again, we have new characters introduced who fall for her sweetness and fall all over themselves to help her. I can't say I really bought it and it would have been nice to have someone actually dislike her for being too good-two-shoes and naive.

About half way through the Audible narration, I got really bored. Juliet unsure, Warner pining for her, some silly plot device about her family and a secret that Warner fears will make her hate him. It wasn't enough to keep me interested since we really didn't get any character or plot development and it all felt kind of vapid.

The Audible narration got old as well. Juliet sound like she is 12 and the addition of Warner's perspective didn't do much for me. It was kind of jarring to go from Warner sounding one way with the female narrator and then sounding different with the male narrator.",1522972800,3

8359,167,276,"I read this book as part of my concerted effort to fill in literary gaps in my reading history. And, to be honest, reading the current crop of new novels and works of non-fiction was starting to get me down. I needed a break. With few exceptions, it seems, the literary edges are all pretty sharp these days.

And what a break this was. I cant remember the last author I read that was as gifted at dialogue and character development. After every page I asked myself, How did she do that? The characters are nuanced, and they do grow, at least some of them, but Austen is able to maintain consistency and continuity within each character throughout the story and the abundant dialogue. Few authors of any era have accomplished that.

The theater is the English landed gentry of the late 18th Century and the language, on the surface, reflects the theater, but the focus is the diverse cast of characters. She provides enough description to give the story context and realism but this is definitely a story about people and it could be people of any era. You will dislike some, laugh at the absurdity of others, and identify positively with a few. You will, however, feel them all come to life.

And while its far from a glowing portrayal of the culture of the day it is not just a social commentary either. There is a message, but she tells a story, and, again, there aren't many authors who have ever been able to pull that off. They usually succeed at one or the other.

In the end, it was an uplifting read, not because of the storyline or the commentary, however. Im not that interested in the culture of the British landed gentry of the 18th Century. I think I would go so far to say that I feel fortunate I was not born in the era in any class of society. It was the prose itself that was uplifting. That someone could write that effectively is really quite inspiring for a book lover.

I highly recommend it.",1522972800,5

8372,73,1837,"Twentieth in the Inspector Ian Rutledge historical mystery series set in England just after World War I, December 1920 to be more accurate, and revolving around a shellshocked Scotland Yard inspector.

My Take
The Gate Keeper was compelling with the questions it raised, the bitterness, and the mystery of how all these dead men connect. A reveal that is heartbreaking in its simplicity and meanness.

We read the story from Rutledges perspective in single third person point-of-view, so we know about Rutledges interactions with Hamish as well as his thoughts on the case. Bitter thoughts for it's a two-sided bitterness. One is the greed for money and the other is the greed to hurt. And the weakness that allows this bitter greed to continue.

Its a rare mix of the horrible with the truly decent, and through it all, Todd takes us back to the England of 1920 with its dress, mores, lifestyle, social interactions, and the technology. They definitely make me feel the period, and it makes me mourn for it. Although, Im damned grateful for cellphones, let alone a landline in every house!

I do find these post-World War I novels fascinating to read, as they reflect the changes that occured in the traditional pre-war lifestyle that led to what we experience now. That women's lib, y'know. So few men returned from the battlefields, and so many women had had to do a mans work while the soldiers were gone.

What's truly sad is that Stephens death is actually easier than his life had been. Then theres Robin, and as his character is revealed, you cant help but pity him. Todd did a beautiful job on the psyches of these people. Wrenching, but very well done.

The Story
A man admired with hardly an enemy in the world is killed. Murdered in the night. On a lonely road. A body Inspector Ian Rutledge almost stumbles across.

He's desperate to stay out of London now that Frances is married, and this body is a godsend. Until he begins to uncover the bitter hatred and absolute love in which Stephen Wentworth is held. Until the next man is murdered...and the next.

The Characters
Detective Ian Rutledge came home from the war a broken man who struggles to survive from day to day, solving the problems of others in his job with Scotland Yard. Frances is the beloved sister who married Peter that afternoon. Corporal Hamish MacLeod is the resolute soldier whom Rutledge shot on the battlefield in 1916, and his ghost now follows Ian everywhere.

Scotland Yard, London
Chief Superintendent Markham, a Yorkshireman of few words, is Rutledges boss. Sergeants Gibson and Williams run interference for Rutledge. Inspector Vernon was suggested to head up the investigation. Inspector Stevenson is sent to Surrey.

Mallard is a friend of Melindas with the Home Office. Mr Haldane, who claims to be a member of the Foot Police, knows far too much. Matthew Williamson is a book dealer. Garamond is a bookbinding firm.

Wolfpit, Suffolk
A twin and former captain in the Royal Navy, Stephen Wentworth appalled his family when he bought the local bookshop from Mrs Delaney when her husband, Tom, died. (Toms first wife had been Josephine.) Dickens is Mrs Delaneys King Charles spaniel. And the story behind that love of books is also heartbreaking. Nanny, a.k.a., Hazel Charing, had been Stephens only solace; she now lives in Primrose Cottage in Winthrop with Sally. Lydie Butterworth is the protective housekeeper  with a bit of the foretelling  for the family home in Wolfpit. Howard and Margaret Wentworth had been the grandparents. Robbie was the twin who died.

Elizabeth MacRae is the friend Stephen was driving home. Audrey Blackburn is Elizabeths aunt and quite intelligent. Lily is the maid. Will Holden (Matilda is his wife) and Geoff Marshall (his wife, Betty, left him) had been Stephens childhood friends. Miss Frost and Miss Dennis are the local schoolteachers who live in Mr Gradys house; both their fiancs were killed in the war.

Constable Penny is in charge at Wolfpit, who he knuckles under. Dr. Brent is the local physician. Blake is a solicitor for Wentworth and Templeton; Danby is his clerk. Oliver Pace is the mysterious church sexton. Miss Goodwin is one of the older ladies in town and plays the church organ. Thomas Abbot is the rector of St. Marys. Im not sure where Constable Burke fits in.

The lively Hardys are local gentry. The reckless Robin Hardy is the younger son. His cousin Evelyn Hardy lives with her widowed mother in the dower house. Harry, Evelyns brother, had been great friends with Stephen. Mark Quinton is the wrong fianc for Evelyn.

Edgar and Mrs Peterson and George and Mrs Farrow were guests at the dinner party. Another dinner party was hosted by FitzSimmons in Kent with the Drysdales and Desmond and Prue Montgomery (they have a son, Julian).

Frederick Templeton, a former major in a Devon regiment, is a gentleman farmer who takes an intense interest in improving his farm and has a reputation for better farming practices.

The cover suits the darkness and is a metaphor for events within. The black wrought iron gates ajar with the truth spilling out, a cars headlights beaming back along the private and straight drive lined with trees revealing that which had been hidden in that dark and cloud-ridden night of a past. Most of the text is in white: the info blurb at the top, the authors name below that, and the series information at the bottom with the publishers name in the bottom right. The red is in the title just below the authors name and above the gate.

8374,801,1969,"Admittedly, I'm a little late to the Simon party but better late than never. This is a coming of age story about Simon, a sweet, regular teenager (with a strong Oreo addiction) who happens to be gay. It's just that no one else knows he's gay. When someone threatens to reveal his sexual identity, readers witness his struggle which is poignant and helps solidify the connection between Simon and the reader.

Simon is an endearing character who is a little awkward, funny and has a great support system. The camaraderie Simon has with his friends is enviable and their reactions to the crappy stuff that life throws at them were believable. He also has a good relationship with his family and I appreciate that Albertalli doesn't relegate parents to the fringes of the story.  As a mom of three teens, I connected with Simon's mom and the changing bond between parents and their almost-adult kids. It's an awkward time for everyone and Albertalli gets that.

She also gives readers food for thought and I think the idea of heterosexuality not being the default or assumed identity for everyone is an important point and would make for great discussion. But, at the heart of the book is a sweet romance that I got all gushy over. So much gush. And, while I enjoyed piecing together the mystery surrounding the identity of Simon's on-line crush, it was Simon's metamorphosis as he figured out who his is, and who he wants to be, that kept me reading.

This is a coming-of-age story about courage and the excitement and beauty of first love. It has a wonderfully diverse cast; it is funny, heart-warming and relevant. If you love Oreos, sweet romances, witty email banter, likable characters and a story that will make you sigh at the end, then this is the book for you.",1523059200,5

We know three things about Amber. She is in a coma, her husband doesnt love her, and sometimes she lies.

I had a hard time coming up with a numerical rating of this book, so pay more attention to my review than my rating. The first half of this book dragged on. I didn't feel connected to the main character because everything was very vague and filtered out through language, so the character felt far away. There was also a lot of set-up. I realize now that those things were intentional, but it still made it hard to keep going. I didn't give up because the title told me that the main character would be lying, so I was waiting for the twist.

Well, I got a twist. Several of them, in fact. There were so many twists that it felt overdone. After the first twist, I was excited and finally felt interested in the story. It redefined everything I thought was happening. And then there was another twist, and another twist. Then by the ending, I was so confused about what actually happened.

I like when Im blown away by twists and when I feel the need reread a book to catch the things I missed. With this story, I think it would be beneficial to reread it, but I just don't have to desire to. Mainly because the dream/hallucination sequences and scenes when she was in a coma; they were too purple prose for me.

8378,896,1505,"It's been a week since I finished this book, and I'm still trying to figure out what the heck happened. But, that's a sign of a good, twisty thriller, right?
It's hard to write any sort of review without spoiling the story - and this is a story that you don't want to know anything about, aside from the main premise.
So my thoughts: very well-written, great twists, and delightfully British. (I add that last part because I can't think of a non-British thriller. Literally every thriller I've read in the past three years has been British. What is going on over there that everyone has to write about twisty, psycho people?)
I for sure recommend this read!",1523059200,4
8379,920,880,"""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" is a collection of three novellas set in the continent of Westeros, a century before the events of ""Game of Thrones."" The protagonists are a hedge knight named Ser Duncan the Tall (Dunk), and his shaven-headed, big-mouthed little squire, Aegon (Egg). In the parlance of Game of Thrones, a hedge knight is the lowest and poorest form of knight, one who sleeps in hedges beneath the stars rather than in the fancy pavilion (tent) which wealthy or landed knights can afford, and basically wanders the land looking for employment as a fighting man. Dunk is seven feet tall, illiterate and somewhat naive despite having been raised in the slums of Flea Bottom, but he lives and breathes chivalry, and in that sense is closer to the GoT character Brienne of Tarth than just about anyone else in George R.R. Martin's world. However, it is important for anyone about to buy ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" to understand that these novellas are different in character than the ""Game of Thrones"" series they precede. Though they contain all the lore, language and description of Martin's other works, they are largely free of the vulgarity, sexuality and violence that are replete all throughout GoT. Indeed, the first two tales remind me strongly of the ""Robin Hood"" stories my father grew up with in the 30s and 40s, in their chivalrous, swashbuckling, G-rated quality (there is ""clean"" violence and some romantic situation, but no torture or sex). The third is somewhat more in the spirit of GoT, as it is heavy with intrigue and there is a fairish bit of fighting; but the overall spirit is definitely different. You can call it ""Game of Thrones Lite,"" or perhaps more fairly, ""Game of Thrones, PG-13."" I don't think this diminishes the quality; rather it is a slight change of perspective, a more lighthearted approach. If you had kids who were young adults, this would be the best way to integrate them into the world of GoT.

The first novella, ""The Hedge Knight,"" introduces us to Dunk, who is recently minted as a knight and ends up with a mysterious squire, dubbed Egg, who accompanies him to a jousting tournament. Unfortunately for Dunk, whose sense of honor is stronger than his sense of self-preservation, he falls afoul of a Targaryen prince and finds himself in need of six fellow knights to defend himself in a trial by combat. This is the cleanest and the lightest of the tales, very reminiscent of the Errol Flynn swashbucklers of the 30s and 40s.

The second novella, ""The Sworn Sword,"" finds Dunk and Egg in the service of Lord Osgrey, a landed knight who is the last of his line and embroiled in a bitter dispute with his wealthier and more powerful neighbor, the notorious Red Widow. When the other sworn sword in Osgrey's service slices up one of the Widow's men following an argument, it is up to Dunk to negotiate a peace or train an ""army"" for war, but as is usual in Westeros, nothing is what it seems and it's never clear whether treachery or gossip shapes reality more. Though the stakes are almost comically small (the ""army"" of Osgrey is two knights and eight hapless peasants), Martin weaves his usual web of history and intrigue into the tale, with plenty of twists and even a little romance.

The last novella, ""The Mystery Knight,"" is probably the closest to GoT in terms of its atmosphere. Dunk has decided to participate in another jousting tournament, only to discover -- belatedly, as he discovers everything -- that the tourney is really a front for a nefarious plot involving various factions of the Tergaryen family. This story is laden with intrigue and to some extent, so weighted down with backstory and characters and references to ancient happenings, that I found it difficult to navigate, but at the same time it is the most ""adult"" of the novellas and probably the closest to GoT in terms of its complexity.

I struggled a bit with deciding whether to give this collection three stars or four. I settled on four because I found it very readable (despite the somewhat convoluted third tale) and fun; I was also eager to return to Westeros after finishing the fifth GoT book and, like everyone else, waiting in vain for the sixth. Truth is, they don't make books like this anymore, and I found the overall spirit of the stories to be refreshingly good-hearted and adventurous. Not sure if casual fans will find enough of what they're looking for, but for the harder-core -- or for those turned off by the brutality of the normal GoT world -- this might be just the ticket.",1523059200,4
8380,93,1965,"My Dear Hamilton captured my attention and my heart.  And thats coming from a woman who hated American History classes.  I wish history books in school were written this way. I might have enjoyed it a lot more.

My Dear Hamilton tells the story not of Alexander Hamilton but of his wife Eliza Schuyler Hamilton.  Its a story of her life journey as a daughter of a patriot, a loyal sister, a wife of one of the US founding fathers, and a dedicated mother of eight.  It also shows her views on life, her patriotism, and her dedication to her cause.

..heartbroken against relentless losses..;  Eliza encountered one tragedy after the next in her adult life.  It was also heartbreaks and betrayals by not only her husband but the country she served. Despite the tragedies, she handled it all with grace.  This lady was not just a survivor, she was pretty kickass in her days.

Authors Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoei did a remarkable job telling Elizas story.  Plucking facts from her past and giving readers a better view of her life. I was in a constant awe and I could not put this book down.  Elizas story both saddened and humbled me. I cant even find the right words to describe her. She is nothing short of amazing, thats for sure.

I love that this author duo decided to write books about the women in our American history.  To not only acknowledge their accomplishments, but also the heartaches and hardships they endured.  Im hoping they keep writing these books. If Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie write it, I will read it!",1523059200,5
8381,505,205,"Dracula is a classic gothic story about vampires. It's one of the oldest and most adored stories that has ever existed. There have been many retellings and movies created in honor of this book.

So, I have a confession. Until this point, I have never read Dracula. I've always been curious about it. How could I not be? It's one of the most popular stories of all times. When I was a child, I was completely afraid of the thought of the story. As a teenager, I had an aversion to anything popular. And now here we are.

Either way, I really enjoyed the story and I'm glad I read it. It wasn't exactly what I had in mind when I thought about this story, but that's not exactly a bad thing. I really enjoyed it. I can't say I am as in love with it as many people who have read it are, but I don't hate it!

8383,920,862,"THE DIRT is a fascinating, XXX-rated look into the history of Mtley Cre as told by its members, managers, and victims. I've read a fairish bit of rock 'n roll autobiography, but never a ""collaborative autobiography"" that allows an entire band to tell its story in such a brutally honest way. For sheer debauchery, immaturity, selfishness, self-destructiveness and yes, over-the-top-showmanship, you'd be hard pressed to find better subject matter. Nikki Sixx, Vince Neil, Tommy Lee and Mick Mars united on the Sunset Strip in the early 80s to live a rock 'n roll dream of sex, drugs, sex, drugs, fast cars, sex, more drugs, more sex, fights, divorces, arrests, fame, gold records, and, well, still more sex. Somewhere in that steaming heap of sin, crime and outrage is music, but you have to scrape pretty deep through the dirt to find it. And there is a lot of dirt. You'd be hard pressed to find four more temperamental, nihilistic, combative, angry, dysfunctional people on earth: each man's story is a nightmare of abuse, neglect, rampage, substance abuse, rebellion, compensation, disease and anger...and that was before they were rock stars. It only got worse when unlimited cash allowed them to act on every impulse they had, from groupies to heroin to hotel-room vandalism that would have shocked Attila the Hun. Yet when they came together, they managed to become one of the top 10 metal bands of all time, selling 100 million records worldwide, and ""The Dirt"" is their story. It was particularly fascinating for me, a Cre-head from the 80s, to hear the band's story in its own words. But it isn't just the band we hear from: in addition to Sixx, Neil, Mars and Lee, we also get the surprisingly touching story of John Corabi, the ill-starred replacement for Neil, whose dream of rock fame became a nightmare when fans and the label rejected him; also from various producers and managers who tried to steer the Cre-ship from one wreck to another. On top of this, we get the inside scoop on all of it: Tommy Lee's marriages to Heather Locklear and Pamela Anderson and the jail time he did for domestic abuse; Neil's coming of age in Compton (!), his conviction for killing ""Razzle"" Dingley in a drunken car accident and his daughter's tragic death from cancer; Nikki's horrific childhood and his deadly dance with heroin addiction; Mars' lifelong battle with a painful and debilitating disease which is turning his skeleton into stone. Nothing is left unexamined, from touring with Ozzy Osbourne to fighting with Axl Rose. It's a fascinating ride, and contains a great deal of rock 'n roll history -- especially the band's reminiscences of the late 1970s/early 1980s on the Sunset Strip, when the guys were living in the notorious "" Mtley house"" and sharpening their rockstar skills while still poor and obscure.

While not for the faint of heart -- some of what's described is disgusting in the extreme (sleeping with each other's wives and girlfriends, overdosing on heroin and then waking up to shoot more, doing things with groupies that could easily be called rape) -- it is an unvarnished, no-b.s. look into what drives people into rock 'n roll and how they behave when they get there. There is even a certain maturity and perspective that creeps into the later chapters, when personal tragedies, addiction, failed marriages, lawsuits and jail time have worn the guys down and left them questioning their choices, as well as their fight-frought relationships with each other. All in all, I can recommend this book not only to fans of Mtley Cre, but to those who have no interest in them at all yet crave to know what was like to be a rock star during the heyday of rock 'n roll music. So buckle up, but for God's sake, don't get into a car with Vince Neil.",1523059200,5
8384,711,1968,"Bernadette Manuelito, a young Navajo police officer and the wife of Sergeant Jim Chee, is asked to speak to a group of Navajo teenage girls gathered for a vision quest outing. A major goal of the Wings and Roots program is to encourage troubled Navajo girls to stay in school, get an education and lead productive lives.

Bernie, considered to be an inspiration, arrives at the campsite to give her presentation only to find things in disarray. One of the girls is nowhere to be found, and theyve sent beloved instructor Domingo Cruz to find her. He, too, has vanished. Bernie springs into action and calls in search and rescue to send out a search party as a late spring blizzard looms on the horizon. Annie Rainsong turns up on her own later at the campsite in a terrified state of mind, but Domingo remains missing.

Annie, a rebellious Navajo teen, is a reluctant participant in the outing. The girls were given strict instructions to remain at each of their solitary tent sites so they could reflect by themselves on their goals --- a ritual experience encouraged by the Wings and Roots sponsors. Instead of settling down in her tent, Annie decides to take a walk, makes a wrong turn in the dwindling daylight, and loses her way on the ancient lava flow of the El Malpais Wilderness Area of Western New Mexico.

As a cold rain begins to fall, Annie stumbles toward what appears to be a cave to seek shelter. Caves are strictly off limits, not only because of animals that might dwell within, but because they are considered holy sites as they were frequently used for burials by ancient Indian tribes. She finally falls into a restless sleep on the rocky floor and awakens at early dawn to look around. She sees ancient petroglyphs on the walls, a sign that the cave has been used for perhaps hundreds of years. Then she notices what she was laying on --- a human skeleton. She screams in horror and flees from the cave.

Suspicion is aroused surrounding the missing sponsor, who is accused of a fund-raising scandal. Jim Chee, meanwhile, encounters a man who recently got out of prison and is seeing his sister-in-law, which draws Joe Leaphorn into the story as they investigate this mans checkered past in selling stolen Indian artifacts. Is Cruz entangled in this activity to help raise funds for the money-strapped youth group?

Anne Hillerman, daughter of the late mystery writer Tony Hillerman, has continued the saga of two of the most beloved detectives in American western literature. Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee brought the Southwest and Navajo and Hopi ways of life to millions of fans around the world. The Hillermans have enlightened us belaganas (the Navajo word for white man) to strong Southwestern Indian moral beliefs and ways of living. The atmospheric prose in CAVE OF BONES brings back fond memories of travel through this mysterious and legendary world that my family calls home.

It also reminds me of my encounter with Tony Hillerman at the Herberger Museum in Phoenix many years ago. It was my first book signing experience, and I had been collecting Hillermans paperbacks for years. As a greenhorn book junkie, I didn't know that you don't haul all of the authors books on your shelves for the author to sign. Drawing scowls from fellow fans, I blushingly nodded at my armload of books, and Hillerman, who had just delivered a spellbinding speech about mystery writing, nodded graciously and allowed me to unload the pile. He signed each and every one --- a testament to the gentleman and scholar he was.

8390,711,1966,"It is very tough to beat the enjoyment of a Peter Swanson novel. Swanson came out of the gate quickly and strongly with THE GIRL WITH A CLOCK FOR A HEART and never looked back. His newly published fourth novel is textbook Swanson. Like its predecessors, it is totally different in subject matter than his other books and is full of twists, turns and surprises experienced by unforgettable characters.

ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LIES ping-pongs between the books present and past. In the present, Harry Ackerson is awaiting his college graduation ceremony when he receives terrible news in the form of a phone call from his stepmother, Alice. Harrys father, Bill, has died suddenly while taking his usual evening walk on a cliff path near his home in tiny Kennewick Village, Maine. The death is originally written off as an accident, but as the story unfolds, investigators begin to suspect foul play.

There is some question as to who would want to harm Bill. He was a respected but quiet bookseller who had established his reputation with a shop in New York, which he sold before moving back to his hometown in Maine and opening a store there. He seemed like the type who would go out of his way to avoid an argument, happy instead to compile lists of books under various topics and displaying an almost encyclopedic knowledge of mystery and detective fiction trivia, while he and an assistant operated what was primarily a mail-order book business.

It is Alice who seems to hold the key to both the doer and the motive. She tells Harry and the police about a former employee of the bookstore who she believes was having an affair with Bill and whose husband is infamous for his violent temper. Harry doesnt know what to think, especially with respect to Alice. Bill and Alice married when he was a senior in high school. He has quietly and secretly nursed an attraction to her that may now be reciprocated. Meanwhile, an enigmatic young woman seems to haunt the vicinity following Bills death. Harry sees her around his fathers house, at the periphery of the funeral, and ultimately at the bookstore. She has a story to tell as well, one that slowly unfolds over the course of the book.

As for the narrative dealing with the past, we learn quite a bit about Alice. She experienced a tumultuous upbringing that would give a clinical psychologist much with which to work. The past raises some issues in the present, which are slowly revealed, particularly throughout the books last half. The title is ironic. There are many lies revealed within, but none of them are especially beautiful. However, the conclusion to this fine story is laced with dark beauty and tinged with irony and kismet.

Swanson meets and exceeds the promises made by his previous work. Part of the books genius is that, with a change here and an edit there --- well, perhaps several of both --- this could have been a cozy novel, given its New England setting and focus on bookselling. It is most definitely not. Its dark as dark can be, and I loved every word.

8402,983,411,"Yuval Noah Harari has written an engaging beach book that takes on the biggest of Big History (pace David Christian and his acolytes) questions (no: not ""Why is there something rather than nothing?"" - but he does go back some 13.7 billion years, all the way to the Big Bang): what's so hot about Homo sapiens? He makes a plausible case for the superior organizational ability of Sapiens (his shorthand/nickname for you and me and everybody), which arises out of the ""Cognitive Revolution"" that began some 40,000 years ago and is carried forward by the interpersonal power of persuasive  language. Homo sapiens are like bees, but with malice aforethought.

But to say as much is, of course, to oversimplify and strip Harari's roller-coaster narrative of all its excitement, panache, humor, quirky, telling observations, marshalling of disparate datapoints from diverse disciplines (the hallmark of Big History), and - a major subtext - his evisceration of ""religion"" as most of us conventionally think about or practice it. He extends the category ""religion"" to cover what we call ""ideologies"" but might instead term (he doesn't) ""secular idols of the masses"": humanism, liberalism, and offshoots like liberal democracy, socialism, capitalism, fascism, and communism. All such belief systems/ideologies should, in Harari's telling, should be bundled up under the heading of ""religion."" Moreover, Harari casually defines all - *ALL* - religion (theist, non-theist, animist, Deist, atheism, agnosticism, liberal humanism, etc. etc.) as language-based ""fictions"" around which tribes, villages, societies, even civilizations, cluster, organize, rise, fall. Culture is thus built on mountains of fictions - a key term in the Harari glossary: essentially, *stories* humans tell for myriad functional, even evolutionary, reasons, that create rationales for group behaviors, leadership, and why things are the way they are (e.g., weather - good, bad, adversarial - dreams, misfortune, good fortune, etc.) and often reify into what we call ""belief system,"" ""mores,"" ""religion,""  ""ideology"":  ""fictions"" Harari distinguishes from the countable reality of science and statistics.

Harari is alternately wise, then oddly superficial, in reducing the story of homo sapiens to materialistic science and the manufacturer of fictions to create cultures, religions, societal organization, civilization itself. His scope is sweeping, his erudition and broad reading impressive, his writing emphatically provocative, yet witty and wildly entertaining for so serious a topic.

Nothing so provocative and entertaining, however, can go very long without drawing the (often self-interested) attention of critics, the most compelling of which must necessarily be from disciplines in which the erudite Harari has read extensively but lacks the scholarly command of the dedicated professional. See, for example, the thoughtful critique of Canadian anthropologist C.R. Hallpike, who knocks Harari for misinformed speculations on the formation of tribes, the cognitive capacities of early tribal Sapiens, differences between human children and chimpanzees, and much else, as well as Harari's indifference to, or ignorance of, scholarly distinctions such as those between ""belief"" and ""convention"" in seeking to determine, if ""fiction"" is untruth, what its opposite may be (that is, just as immaterial as fiction: an idea...and an idea that's given a physical palpability by the discoverers of mathematics and numerical relationships that correspond to nature, which arguably makes the conventions of mathematics, statistics, and science...uh, fictions, and...).

That said, I find it difficult to count the views of thoughtful critics like Professor Hallpike and their undermining of particulars as ""eviscerating""  Harari's main thesis. That is, specialists have every right to point out the inadequacies of callow generalists who trespass onto alien scholarly domains. But Harari's account of the rise of Homo sapiens, viewed from 100,000 feet up or so, seems unshaken; the edifice, and its central conclusion - that Homo Sapiens has been at every juncture left destruction in its wake as the most devastating earthly force in history and, given the path dependence of that human history, has sown the seeds of its own possible destruction - remains solid. That possible destruction contains several plausible evolutionary pathways through environmental challenges, technological augmentations, and medical breakthroughs may produce, in computer scientist Bill Joy's words, ""a future that doesn't need you.""

Harari's importance, in my view, is in the questions he raises, both in Sapiens and in its successor book, Homo Deus, about this possible future that might not need Homo Sapiens. I was born in 1948 and, looking back, feel rather charmed: my generation of Boomers may be the last to live, in general, fully ""human"" lives. My profession, for example - socio-political analysis in a US government organization - will very likely be overtaken by computer algorithms. This may happen before the implications of such superseding are fully explored and understood.

As a result, both of Harari's recent books deserve to be read, interrogated, pondered, and discussed and the scenarios he suggests  deliberated - publicly and privately - in high places. We owe ourselves at least this conversation. And, who knows? We may find shared interests among the strangest of political bedfellows...",1523232000,4

8404,145,284,"Gaiman has collected a series of stories culled from reliable sources and put them together in this remarkable book.  You will read about Odin, the all father, the mighty Thor his son, and Odin's blood brother the tricky Loki.  The first story is of the creation of the worlds and the gods and the others who populate the lands.  There is also a story on how Odin became so wise and how he lost his eye.

In one tale, Sif, Thor's wife, wakes up with her golden hair gone from her head.  Thor knows Loki is behind it and the gods demand that he do something about it. So Loki goes to the dwarves to have them create a special cap of skin with hair attached that will meld with the wearer.  But Loki being Loki he decides to cause trouble and tells the sons of Ivaldi that Brokk and Eitri have said that they are the best craftsmen and that the Ivaldi has challenged them to do better than them in a contest making gifts for the gods.

The Ivaldi take up the challenge, but Brokk and Eitri suspect that Loki is up to something and make a wager with him that if they win the challenge they can have his head.  He agrees and then proceeds to try to sabotage their greatest gift as they are making it in the forge by taking the form of a fly and biting them. For a long time it doesn't work, but at the very end, he gets Brokk to stop doing what he was doing for a second and that caused the gift to not come out as perfect as they intended.

When they face the gods the Ivaldi give Odin a spear that will always find its mark, they give Thor the hair for Sif, and they give Frey a piece of cloth that unfolds into a giant ship.  Brokk gives Odin an arm ring that will multiply, Frey a huge boar with bristles of gold to pull his chariot, and for Thor a hammer. The only problem with the hammer is that the handle is short due to Loki's interference and can only be held one-handed.  The gods agreed that Brokk and Eitri gave the best gift and so Loki had to give his head, but Loki being Loki he found a way out of it by saying that they couldn't cut into his neck. So they placed a leather strap across his mouth and sewed it shut which caused Loki no end of grief.

In another story, Thor woke up one morning to find that someone had stolen his hammer, Mjollnir.  Thor sent Loki out to find who had stolen it and Loki discovered that Thrym, lord of the ogres, has stolen it and won't give it back until he gets Freya's hand in marriage.  Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, has an idea, though he doesn't think Thor will like it much. Thor should dress up as Freya and Loki go as her maiden and infiltrate the ogre stronghold that way and wait until the hammer is given over to make his move. When that happens, Thor takes out all of the ogres.

There are so many good stories in this book. There's one that tells of Loki's three children from a frost giant that are named Fenrir, the wolf, Jormungundr, who became the Midgard serpent, and Hel, who became the ruler of the dead who died unworthy deaths.  Odin placed them where he wanted them to be such as the underworld or Midgard to get rid of them because he feared them, but during Ragnarok, they still come back to haunt him.  Ragnarok is the end of everything and a new beginning and is also a story in this book.  This is a fabulous and fascinating book that delves into these ancient stories and really brings them to life. Gaiman, a master storyteller, really shines here.  I highly recommend reading this book.",1523232000,5

All The Beautiful Lies is about 22 year old Harry Ackerson who returns home from college in the wake of his fathers death. We are then introduced to Harry's stepmother Alice. She had only been married to his father for four years while Harry was away at college so he doesn't really know her all that well. Since his mother died from cancer when he was a teenager she is really the only family he has left. Alice is a beautiful woman and one that Harry has fantasized about in the past. The close quarter living situation is ... awkward... to say the least. It appears Alice also has eyes for Harry. As the police investigate his fathers death it turns out it wasn't an accidental fall at all. He was murdered. Who had motivation to kill him? You'll have to read it to find out.

This book had me intrigued from beginning to end but I just didn't love it. I don't mind reading about taboo topics in fiction but this one just lacked something that I can't quite put my finger on. I didn't find any of it all that shocking. I'm still glad I read it and I think a lot of readers will love this. A solid 3.5 stars!",1523318400,3
8408,594,1966,"Everybody lies.

All the Beautiful Lies by Peter Swanson is a disturbing tale of twisted emotions, betrayal, and obsession. Im not sure if there were any characters who I particularly liked. Nevertheless, its a dark, complex story that I enjoyed reading.

On the brink of his college graduation, Harry Ackerson gets the phone call no one ever wants to receive: his father is dead. Although the police first state that it was an accident, Harry isn't convinced. Distraught and shocked, Harry goes home to Maine.

Awaiting Harry is his stepmother, Alice, who was considerably younger than Harrys father. Harry always felt an awkward and inappropriate attraction to his stepmother, but with his father gone, his emotions are especially mixed up. He needs to figure out what really happened to his dad.

At first, Alice doesnt quite seem like the grieving widow. As Harry spends more time with her, he begins to wonder if she had something to do with her husbands death. Meanwhile, Harry meets Grace, who's new in town and may or may not already have a connection to his father.

As Harry struggles to piece together what remains of his fathers life and death, he finds himself drawn closer to both Alice and Grace. But what Harry ultimately discovers is something he never could have expected.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, with all its severely flawed charactersand even some who are reprehensible. The story veers into uncomfortable territory many times, but its all worth it for that satisfying ending.

I was all over that synopsis and the bird on the cover and sadly it took a lot for me to get through this one.

I really liked Ciara and Leif. She stands up for herself and hes cocky and together they're fantastic. I loved the scenes of them bantering or kissing or pushing each others buttons.

Plot wise it was booooooooring and yet not. When there are awesome things happening, they're mostly awesome. Its the parts in between where I struggled to keep going. Eventually things got repetitive and this felt like the longest book of my existence. The last 20 or so percent was what I wanted for the entire book, but by then I just wanted it to be over.

Overall, it was a fantastic idea with characters I really liked. The dry, dense plot and stretches of telling and not showing made it drag.

8414,282,1972,"Lexa Hillyer won me over with Spindle Fire last fall. I loved the world building and the characters, and while it started off at a slower pace, Lexa greatly built up the speed by the end, setting the stage for book #2.

Now that I've read Winter Glass, the verdict is in. I liked Spindle Fire but I LOVED Winter Glass!

Winter Glass takes this duology to a whole new level! It's fast paced as well as exciting; it contains romance and adventure; and there simply wasn't a time where I wasn't dying to know what would happen next. In fact, I became so invested in the story that I forget to eat dinner.

Just like with Spindle Fire, Winter Glass contains multiple POVs and once again Lexa does a marvelous job of bringing them together. I enjoyed seeing from so many perspectives - Aurora, Isabella, Malfleur, Wren, Gilbert, etc. Each added something special to the book, and I liked the way in which Lexa used this to build suspense and tension. So many times I thought to myself ""hmm, that character is acting a little odd"" and later on I'd read from that character's perspective and think ""now that makes so much more sense!""

Talking about the characters, Winter Glass also brings about some fantastic character development.

Aurora and Isabella, the two leading ladies, contain to grow and proposer, individually as well as together.

When the book begins, Aurora has mixed feelings about waking up. She wants to go back to her dream world, to Wren and Heath; however, she also wants to take down Malfleur for good. In the process, she becomes more fierce, more willing to take risks, and she also begins to follow her heart, and where it takes her may surprise her as well as the reader.

Isabelle, on the other hand, is torn between two loves - the love she has for her sister and the love she has for Prince William. At first, I was slightly peeved with Isabella. I couldn't believe she was so willing to give up her chance at happiness so quickly. I wished she would talk to Aurora, tell her who she was feeling and work from there. However, deep down, I could understand why - Isabella's always felt the need to protect her sister, and even though she's changed while Aurora's been asleep, it has remained her gut reaction. I enjoyed seeing her take charge as the book progressed as well as embrace the parts of her that made her unique.

Together, Isabelle and Aurora aren't the same as they were before. There's secrets, tensions, and mixed signals, and even though they are tougher, they seemingly aren't. I enjoyed seeing their sister bond further explored, and I have to say I was quite happy with the overall result.

In regards to the plot, Winter Glass picks up where Spindle Fire left off. The quest to bring Malfleur down is still a central point, and Winter Glass manages to take this storyline in some exciting new directions. It brought about adventures and new characters, all of which I found interesting. I especially enjoyed the trip into the Ice kingdom. There's also major changes in Isabelle and Aurora's kingdom.

Lastly,  I appreciated how once again Lexa Hillyer makes you question the lines between evil versus good. More about Malfleur's past is reveled, and while I don't condone what she has done, I can understand it to a point. All she wanted was love, but when she felt that love threatened, she did what she thought was best: take love away from the people whose love failed her.

Overall, Winter Glass is an exemplary follow-up, and I feel that readers who may have felt iffy about Spindle Fire will really enjoy this one. I'm sad to see this series come to an end, but I couldn't be happier with the conclusion.",1523318400,5
8415,70,1971,"Initially my draw to this book was the cover, it is just beautiful, but Beyond a Darkened Shore was also a really good read! The combination of Celtic and Norse mythology with strong warriors and a sweet romance made for a lovely story. Beyond a Darkened Shore is about an invasion that is going to be taking place and in order to overcome the troubles ahead two enemies, Ciara and Leif, have to come together to fight their shared enemy as one. That is a lot to ask for from bitter enemies, especially when one side blames the other for the slaughter of their sibling.

I loved Ciaras character so very much. She was not welcomed by her family or her community because she had supernatural powers. She was only kept around because she was useful in a fight. Ciara, for her part, primarily stayed to protect her remaining sisters. When she was younger they had been attacked by some Northmen and she had seen one sister murdered right in front of her, which of course led to her vowing revenge. Since that time, she had built up her warrior skills so that she could provide adequate protection to her family and community. I loved her devotion to her siblings. They loved her too but there was a huge wedge between them, a wedge in the form of their mother.

When Ciara and Leif first meet, it is on the battlefield. A group of Northmen had come to the shore and Ciaras people saw it as an attack. After engaging in a battle Ciara was able to capture Leif, which was a big no-no because in their culture, they have a just kill policy. Ciara took him as a prisoner though because he was apparently immune to her supernatural powers and she wanted to know if he 1) understood his powers because she really didn't understand hers and 2) she wanted to know how he managed to resist her powers. Things did not go as planned though and before she knew it she was on a quest with him to take down the giants that were planning an invasion.

While on their quest Ciara and Leif grow to know each other and let their guards down a bit. They develop a shaky friendship that slowly turns into something more. The romance between Ciara and Leif is akin to a puppy love type romance but given how little experience Ciara has had with men and relationships, I felt that the speed and manner of the romance was realistic. Leif was such a good guy and there was a part in the story where she was able to see his inner thoughts on her and it was just very swoony! Too sweet! I know for hardened warriors they were a bit sappy but I really liked the romance between them. 

Beyond a Darkened Shore had some great battle scenes, not to mention great characters such as immortals, Valkyries, a murder of crows, ravens, and a villain you will love to hate. Oh Lord, he is despicable, I soooo hated him! The start of the story was a little slow for me, but once Ciara and Leif took off on their quest together the story started to pick up. I think that if I was intimately familiar with Celtic and Norse mythology I would have gotten so much more from this story and if you are a reader who does love either type of mythology this story will probably resonate with you. Or you will know enough to call it out on some issues, for me who does not know much (but I did recognize Odin, so go me) I found it to be a fascinating addition to the story. I recommend you get your hands on a copy when it hits the shelves!

8417,167,1973,"This is a timely book by a brilliant person who had a front row seat to the tragedy that was Europe in the Mid-20th Century. There is little doubt that the world is starting to look fearfully like it did at the beginning of those dark hours, starting with the tyranny of Hitler and Mussolini and culminating in the Cold War and the gulags of the Soviet Union.

Figuratively speaking, this is really three books. The first will be the most divisive and may, in fact, quite unfortunately, relegate the book to practical irrelevance. The second book is extremely insightful and informative. And the third book, honestly, is pure gold and vintage Madeline Albright.

The first book begins with a contradiction. Albright openly acknowledges that Fascism has become a meaningless epithet, hurled, as it is, by opposing politicians of every stripe and at parents merely attempting to limit the cell phone usage of their children. She goes on to defend the titular use of the term, however, by clarifying her use of the term: To my mind, a Fascist is someone who identifies strongly with and claims to speak for a whole nation or group, is unconcerned with the rights of others, and is willing to use whatever means are necessaryincluding violenceto achieve his or her goals.

At that point, however, she hasn't really narrowed the list of politicians who qualify for the pejorative label at all. Every reader will conclude that his or her political enemies fit the bill. She seals the fate of this portion of the book, however, when she asks, on page 4 of the book, why, this far into the twenty-first century, are we once again talking about Fascism? And answers, One reason, frankly, is Donald Trump. If we think of Fascism as a wound from the past that had almost healed, putting Trump in the White House was like ripping off the bandage and picking at the scab. And she goes on to make thinly veiled comparisons between Trump, Mussolini, and Joseph McCarthy.

And, unfortunately, I fear, she, in one fell swoop of prose, both fuels the fires of division while exiling the book to practical irrelevance. In the end, she will likely only energize both political extremes, and, I suspect, the reader ratings of this book will ultimately reflect that.

That is most unfortunate because without those opening pages this would be a truly terrific book. It chronicles both relevant history and the recent past to a degree that few other people on the planet could.

The second part of the book is devoted to an analysis of recent political events in Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Venezuela, the Philippines, Russia, North Korea, and, of course, the United States. All, to varying degrees, she maintains, are showing signs of a slide toward Fascism and the decline of post-war liberal democracy. It is an informative analysis and unless you are a political junkie, you will learn a lot.

In the third part of the book she truly hits her stride. She notes, for starters, that the Fascist epithet may be appropriate for the US today for reasons having more to do with economics than populism. The Fascist Party of Italy, which gave rise to general use of the term, was the ultimate merger of the corporate and political states. And that is, in fact, what has happened here in the US.

The incorporation of America has been going on since the conservative movement of the 1980s, however, and while Trump is carrying the corporate water at the moment, he can hardly be blamed for allowing Wall Street and Silicon Valley to take control of Washington.

The incorporation accelerated greatly during the dot-com 90s when young entrepreneurs were preaching disruption and libertarianism. It is ironic, indeed, that techs democratic perspective has now produced among the biggest and most powerful corporations the world has ever known. And they pulled it off, actually, while the anti-trust regulators in both Republican and Democratic administrations stood by and watched.

To me what we have today is not so much analogous to the Fascist or Nazi parties of the mid-20th Century as it is the power of the church in Medieval Europe. The kings and queens of Washington may wear the crowns, but it is the corporate popes of Wall Street and Silicon Valley that are really calling the shots.

Which is why both parties, I think, should be fearful of whatever happens in the mid-term elections. Be careful what you wish for. Neither party has defined an agenda that addresses the issues that originally brought Trump to power. And until that happens I believe Albrights Fascist warning will remain valid.

In the final chapters of the book Albright notes that putting American interests first invites Russia, China, and others to do the same. And it is here that she lowers her partisan guard (we all have one) and calls for unity through the recognition of our common humanity and the rejection of extremism that favors one group over another.

It is here that she also seems to soften her position on ideals of post-war democratic liberalism and focuses more on compassion, integrity, and fairness. I think of it as defining a new standard of shared obligation and responsibility that includes those countries and those people that aren't rushing to implement an Electoral College and to copy our form of bare-knuckle individualism, but those are my words, not hers.

In the end she notes that spend her time on issues like: purging excess money from politics, improving civic education, defending journalistic independence, adjusting to the changing nature of the workplace, enhancing inter-religious dialogue, and putting a saddle on the bucking bronco we call the Internet. Its a perfect ending to what is a very good book by an inspiring individual.

- There's interesting world building, but mostly because most of it is Norse and Irish mythology.

8419,382,1971,"I enjoyed this book a whole lot. The story was so exciting and I simply adored the characters. The writing was pretty great too. At first I thought it might be a five star, but I ended up having a few smaller issues, so four stars it is. But gosh, I really liked this book. And I cannot wait to own a finished copy of this gorgeous.

This book tells the story of seventeen year old Ciara. It's set way back in time, and I loved that lots. And oh, how I adored this girl. I loved that the whole book is from her point of view. And I loved getting to know her. She was awesome. I loved how much she cared for her sisters. I hated how her parents didn't care for her.

The plot in this book was so exciting. It takes place ages ago, in a place with magic. The magic isn't a big part of this world, just small things. Ciara has magic in her. She has the ability to enter the mind of a person, and change it. This was pretty interesting to read about. I did like how her ability changed later on, though that new part was a bit too much, maybe. But it was interesting to read, and I liked that. Ciara was pretty awesome. She both loved and hated her ability, and I liked that about her a lot. Her world has been at war for ages now, with the dangerous Northmen coming often to raid their village, stealing and murdering. Her older sister got murdered because of this years ago, and Ciara has sworn revenge. It was heartbreaking yet amazing.

This book begins with a raid on Ciara's village. And it was pretty interesting to read about, yet a bit brutal too. Lots of death. It ends with Ciara taking a boy prisoner. This boy is Leif. So begins this story. These two enemies are meant to become allies, to help defeat something evil that is coming for everyone. Ciara has been told this by a crow person. Which sounds weird, yet was pretty awesome. But yeah. Ciara and Leif pretty much hate each other, but they also seem amused by each other right away; and I loved that.

There is so much happening in this book. I'm not going to describe all of it. Just that this book is long yet not long enough. And the villains were all kinds of evil and I hated them. Yet sort of didn't truly understand the reason for why they were so evil. But they were and they were awful. And their way of killing was the worst. Aw. Yet so fascinating to read about too. But also the worst. Yet so good. How rude. But anyway. The story in this book was all kinds of awesome. There is even a kelpie. Which was so creepy and great.

I really enjoyed the romance in this book. Ciara and Leif are so different yet so the same too. They both had a loss in their life. They have lots of other things in common too. And oh, reading about them slowly learning to trust each other and become friends was the best. Eee. Nothing happen for at least half the book, and I was okay with that. Because just reading about them being together was all kinds of fun. And when the romance did happen, I loved it so. They fit together so well and I shipped them the very most.

The reason for why this book was a four star and not a five, was because of the magic. Sort of. I felt like some parts of it were a bit too much. It was always exciting, but maybe a bit too much. But despite that, I enjoyed this book so very much. The story was so interesting and so evil. There is a lot of death in this book. Some heartbreaking. Some awesome. The ending was pretty good, though. First totally evil. Hmph. But then good. Pretty sure this is a standalone, and it doesn't need more, but I would not say no to more.

I'm not going to say much more about this book. I find that I simply have no more words to describe why I liked it and how much I liked it. Which was a whole bunch. I loved most of this book. And it was all just so exciting and I adored the characters so much. Sigh. I would love to read more about them all. This book is mostly about Ciara and Leif, though. And I adored that. There is a lot of fighting. And a bit of awesome backstory. And lots of great flirting. Yess. This whole book was amazing. Sigh. I'm so happy that I read it.

Huge thank you to the publisher for the auto-approval on Edelweiss, eee. I'm so thrilled that I was able to read and review this book early. Now I just have to hunt down that print ARC, because I need it like crazy. This book was so so good. And it's gorgeous. I love that cover so much. Beyond a Darkened Shore was everything I was hoping it would be and more. Fierce characters and a stunning slow romance. Exciting plot and evil villains. I'm so glad I read this book. And I think you'll all love it too. And so go order it. Now.

8422,803,1926,"This is a brilliantly crafted thriller.

The psychological aspects are wonderfully done - both as we join the police in a desperate search for a victim before it's too late and as we witness the horror of another cop deep undercover in a psychiatric ward as she tries to get close to a maniacal accused killer.

My favorite character by far was Saga.  She's so incredibly strong, yet emotionally vulnerable.  She kicks butt!

This was a mystery that simply didn't let go.  From the first page to the last, I was completely engaged.

I want to read this author again!",1523318400,5
8423,596,241,"Oh my heart!  There is just something about books about dogs that gives them the ability to touch on every single one of my emotions.  I am going to let you in on a little secret.  I love dogs.  A lot.  I like my three dogs more than I like most people and would love a chance to spend one moment in their heads so this story really appealed to me on every level.  I loved this book when I read it years ago and I loved it just as much when I listened to the audio for a re-read.  It was a lot of fun to spend a few hours in Enzo's mind.

I was really kind of surprised by how much of the book I actually remembered from my initial read years ago but it seems that this story had really stayed with me over the years.  I loved Enzo's voice.  Did he sound like a dog all of the time?  Probably not.  I mean I think if I were to hear one of my dog's internal monologues there would be a lot of requests for snacks and ball playing and not a lot else.  Who knows maybe I am wrong and my dogs are pondering the meaning of life but I honestly doubt it.  Enzo is a bit of a philosopher and hopes to eventually get his chance as a human.  Nothing really gets past Enzo and he seems to figure what is going on in his house before the humans do.

This isn't just a book about a dog.  It is really a book about a family that is told by the dog.  Denny is Enzo's human and he has some really high points in the book and some really low one.  With everything that Denny has to deal with in this book, it is amazing that he is able to stay so positive through it all.  The one constant in the story is the bond between these two.  We get to see Denny adopt Enzo as a puppy and then go through a lot of milestones together.

This was the first time that I have listened to Christopher Evan Welch narrate a book and I thought he did a great job with this one.  This was a rather emotional story at times and I thought that he really was able to pack a lot of feeling into his reading.  He used a very pleasant reading voice and read the story with perfect pacing.  I would definitely listen to his work again in the future.

I would recommend this book to others.  I probably felt just about every emotion while listening to this one.  The only part of the book that I wasn't a huge fan of was the epilogue because it was just a little too much for me and didn't feel necessary.  I do love the book and will probably read it again in a few years.",1523318400,4
8424,152,59,"Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz

I am always intrigued by a mystery novel in which an author is involved. Maybe this is because of my love and admiration for Murder, She Wrote. When I first heard that the author of the Alex Rider series, authorized James Bond and Sherlock Holmes scribe and creator of my favorite tv mystery (besides Murder, She Wrote) Midsomer Murders was writing a story within a story about an author who is found dead and the clues might be in his last book, I nearly fainted from excitement. I jumped into the hardcover shortly after it arrived and read and read and read, then put down, and waited several months before picking up again.
This book is a terrific value for money and is not one you can read in one sitting. For a reader who is willing to take the time to read it and absorb its fabulous. There are a lot of things to pay attention too. Maybe even a note pad is good so you can keep the novel within this straight with the real life novel happening as well. But Anthony Horowitz took a subject matter and wrote it with expert precision.  The end is wonderful and Anthony has a wonderful precision in his red herrings.

Synopsis: From the New York Times bestselling author of Moriarty and Trigger Mortis, this fiendishly brilliant, riveting thriller weaves a classic whodunit worthy of Agatha Christie into a chilling, ingeniously original modern-day mystery.
When editor Susan Ryeland is given the manuscript of Alan Conways latest novel, she has no reason to think it will be much different from any of his others. After working with the bestselling crime writer for years, shes intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus Pnd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy English villages. An homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers, Alans traditional formula has proved hugely successful. So successful that Susan must continue to put up with his troubling behavior if she wants to keep her job.
Conways latest tale has Atticus Pnd investigating a murder at Pye Hall, a local manor house. Yes, there are dead bodies and a host of intriguing suspects, but the more Susan reads, the more shes convinced that there is another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript: one of real-life jealousy, greed, ruthless ambition, and murder.
Masterful, clever, and relentlessly suspenseful, Magpie Murders is a deviously dark take on vintage English crime fiction in which the reader becomes the detective.",1523404800,4
8425,282,1971,"Beyond a Darkened Shore was one of my most anticipated releases of April. Anything described as ""Vikings meets Frostblood"" automatically gains my attention, and I still can't get over how gorgeous the cover is. Now that I've read the book, I can say it fits the story perfectly.

So did Beyond a Darkened Shore live up to my expectations? Unfortunately, the answer to this is somewhere between yes and no. Some parts of this book, especially the beginning, I downright loved; however, as the story progressed and the characters developed, I became less and less enchanted with the overall picture.

The beginning of this story is honestly the best part. We're quickly thrown into action, as enemy troops are slowly approaching Ciara's kingdom. Ciara is quick to first get her sisters to safety and then her men ready for battle. The tensions are high, and I was on the edge of my seat, dying to know what would happen next. Would Ciara's sisters be okay? What did the incoming troops hope to accomplish? What exactly was Ciara's power and how was the crow involved? Additionally, it's easy to get a feel for Ciara's character in this scene. You can feel her fear - fear for her sisters, mother, father, and men - as well as her determination and ferocity. She loves her kingdom, and nothing, no army or outer force, will take it away from her. As the battle develops, it sets important events into motion - Ciara's first encounter with Leif and the omen she receives from the crow.

After this scene, I couldn't wait to see what would come next, and for a while, I was relatively satisfied with everything. Ciara continued to be a character that was easy to like as well as root for. I gave her props for standing up for what she believed in, no matter the cost. The scene with her father, in particular, was a strong one. I also enjoyed the mythology included. It's what originally attracted me to this story, and I thought Jessica did a decent job of expanding upon it.

But then the story fizzled out...

One of the biggest problems with Beyond a Darkened Shore was the pacing. As I've mentioned before, it started off bang, but then it slowed down considerably. I was okay with this at first. I figured some backstory and character development had to be established, but then the pace never picked up. The story continued to drag, and I became less and less invested. I wanted excitement, thrill, something to keep me glued to the page, but the energy associated with the first part never seemed to come back. It was underwhelming and even disappointing.

The other problem I had involved Leif and Ciara's relationship. When the story first began I was willing to overlook the predictability of it - enemies that become something more and must also save the world together - but I couldn't overlook the fact that I felt that Leif served no real purpose but to be Ciara's right-hand man. I never could get a good sense of Leif. I couldn't get a feel for his personality, his wants and desires, and the book suffered because of it. I also didn't feel a true chemistry between Ciara and him. Yes, on the surface they were similar, but it never dove deeper than that, in my opinion. At the end of the day, how could I be invested in a bond and a relationship when I felt that I barely knew the male lead? Plus, I didn't like how this relationship affected Ciara's personality. She went from being this strong, fearless leader to someone who over thought everything and jumped to conclusions.

Overall, Beyond a Darkened Shore is a solid 3-star read. The premise here is fantastic, the opening even better, but the middle and end are what turn this story from something special to something that's hard to get through.

8426,710,1974,"This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever read  and it is a true story! Across the top of the front cover of the book is a very powerful description  Four Strangers, Three Faiths, and One Extraordinary Escape to Freedom.

Mohammed Al Samawi grew up in Yemen being taught to hate Christians and Jews. But then he met Luke, a Christian professor, and they struck up a friendship. With sincere concern for Luke, Mohammed presented him with a copy of the Quran. Luke agreed to read the Quran if Mohammed would read the Bible. This challenge would ultimately totally change Mohammeds life.
The more he read, the more he came to realize that Jews, Christians, and Muslims are more similar than they are different. This realization resulted in so many questions he knew he had to get answers. He began on-line interactions with Jews and Christians and attended conferences in Sarajevo and Jordan. It was in Jordan that he met a young lady who would later help save his life. But his interactions with Jews and Christians soon got the attention of the extremist groups. He began receiving death threats and soon knew his life was truly in danger. How could he get out of Yemen? Fearing for the safety of his family he left his home of Sanaa and fled to Aden.

In Aden, he reached out on social media asking for help. He was trapped, all alone, in the bathroom of his apartment while outside the gunfire and grenades exploded. His social media friends became his family, there with him 24 hours a day.

It was four young interfaith activists  two in the US and two in Tel Aviv - with no experience in foreign affairs, international relations, or foreign diplomacy who, through social media, carried out a miracle. They reached out to everyone they knew and got them to also reach out to their networks. And people responded! They connected with various militaries, governments, and organizations where they found some who were willing to help. The way they got him out of Yemen is just mind-boggling. Not only did they get him out of Yemen but they then got him to the US.

This is a miraculous story. It restores faith that there really are good people out there who will go to great measures for people they do not know. Why? It is just the right thing to do I guess. It really should be no surprise too that his story has already been picked up to be made into a movie. This is absolutely a MUST READ.",1523404800,5
8427,340,1739,"A generous 3 stars.

Fascinating Topic but Chris Voss is a downer. I don't know how he does it being so...casual and dull.

I read the book then watched 3 interviews with Chris on Youtube. All were the same boring stories,

There are maybe 5 principles in the book that Chris focuses on and he gives several examples of them , yet they still don't make sense or register a "" That's Right ! "" from me. Sorry I wanted to love this book but I didn't. I was hoping it would be another 48 Laws of Power which I adored.

8432,777,385,"I know I'll be adding this one to my WWII favorites list. This story is told from a slightly different angle than normally found with WWII. This follows three women who are tested and pushed to the limit as war widows immediately after the war. Marianne von Lingenfels is the widow of a Nazi Resistor whose family was upper class. Much of the story takes place in the castles of her husband's ancestors. She's a bit of a do-gooder, rescuing family and friends, volunteering at the camps for displaced people, and remains very politically focused even after the war. Benita is the wife of Marianne's childhood friend, also the widow of a Nazi Resistor, but Benita comes from a humble farming area and has always relied on her beauty and charm to get ahead in life. Then there is Ania, whose background is a bit of a mystery throughout the book. She turns up in one of camps where Marianne is volunteering. Ania's husband was also a resistor, but we find there's much more to Ania's story than meets the eye. The story doesn't stop after the war is over, but we get a glimpse of the intervening years after the war, as Germany struggles to rebuild and define itself again. The women grow old, their children are grown, yet they still have the memories of the horrors of the war and their struggles to survive connecting them.",1523491200,5
8433,372,1957,"In WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES, daring, witty Miss Mari Perkins goes searching for a job and winds up falling for a devilish duke who thinks he has no time for love or romance. A brilliant, heartfelt historical romance tale about what it means to find a family not of blood but borne through patience and love.

I absolutely adored this book from start to finish. Mari is the perfect blend of innocence and cleverness, of daring and friendship. I loved how she interacted with the Dukes children, earning their respect and trust while also engaging their interest in learning, and how she challenged and inspired the Duke of Banksford, Edgar Rochester, to not only listen but also follow through on what he heard. She gained all of their trust by being true to herself, even though she wasn't entirely forthcoming with her own story and secrets. She was endearing and she made this book such a pleasure to read.

If you're looking for an incredibly enjoyable and moving historical romance story with a cast of characters that will steal your heart from the moment they appear, pick up a copy of WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES by Lenora Bell. Its the first book in the authors School for Dukes series and it sets an incredibly high bar for all the books to follow.

Such a fun and moving story. Highly recommend reading this book and this author. I couldn't put it down!",1523491200,5
8434,1141,1277,"Amid all the sadness and loss and wasted life within this story, there was occasional rollicking humor, and frequently a wistful sweetness that even tragedy could not destroy.  I was less interested in Alaska's personality than in those of her friends Miles and the Colonel; Alaska was a psychological whirlwind who never really grew, while Miles and the Colonel struggled hard to figure out who she was and who they were.  Pranks and hijinks aside, it was their struggles that made Looking for Alaska a riveting story.  My two favorite lines, both near the book's end, were ""we had to forgive to survive in the labyrinth,"" and ""If only we could see the endless string of consequences that result from our smallest actions.""  Ultimately the narrator, Miles, discovered that forgiveness gave him enough hope to move forward.",1523491200,5

She's just abandoned her loveless marriage and young daughter Jani, while the family was on a beach vacation in Delaware.  Believe it or not, this is not the worst thing that Polly has ever done.  So, who is Polly and why has she spent much of her adult life on the run?

Much of the story is told through the POV of Adam Bosk, a stranger Polly hooks up with in a bar/diner in Bellevue, DE. (population, 2,000) while on the run. But, Adam, has his secrets as well, yet an intense relationship begins. Who is Adam and was his meeting Polly more than just coincidence?

A stand alone novel, tense and dark, had me quickly turning the pages. I loved the strong, cunning, Polly character and, when bad things happened it was hard not to suspect anyone but Polly was involved.  Best categorized as dark noir, this was a very quick, satisfying read.",1523577600,5
8436,434,16,"Intense, relevant, realistic, powerful and heart-breaking  one of those books that stays with you long after youve finished, and makes you think. I can see why it won best YA novel for 2017 on Goodreads. The protagonist, Starr Carter blew me away. She is intelligent, strong, resilient, wise-beyond her years, with a teasing, sarcastic sense of humour. Seeing two of her friends killed in front of her own eyes is something no one should ever have to experience in their lifetime  let alone at the tender age of sixteen  and in two separate acts of violence. It saddens and angers me to think that there are real families, and children, in a first world country, in 2018, living like this, exposed to violence on a daily basis, and that said violence is considered normal. I find it almost impossible to process that when they hear gunshots nearby, the Carter family have to hide in their own home  holed up in a room without windows, lights off, in order not to draw attention to their house  a place they should feel safe, but dont. That at the same tender age shes given the birds and bees talk, Starrs parents teach her what she should do, and how she should act, when not if (because its going to happen) she is stopped by police.

Starrs parents, her uncle, her brothers, were all great characters. In fact, all the characters were great and enriched the story. I loved the Carters family dynamic, and that her parents were strict but loving, despite having past scars and issues of their own to cope and deal with. That they wanted the best for their kids, but were torn between leaving their community for a safer life and wanting to stay put and effect change for the better from within. I also liked how the author showed that not everything about Garden Heights was bad and ugly  that good people lived there who were helpful and loyal towards one another.  A must-read, that Id recommend to all, and an author Ill definitely be following.",1523577600,5
8437,864,1974,"This is the story that kept me on the edge of my seat. Imagine being a country torn by civil war and you are a wanted man. The situation is deteriorating and you need to get out  but how? Oh, and that country is Yemen. The Fox Hunt is the memoir of the man in this story.

In this time of division and hate a story like this certainly offers hope. For the author of this memoir is a Muslim and he is helped by an international assortment of friends and associates of all religions and beliefs. They come together to help the PERSON remembering that a person is not the religion they practice but an individual.

Despite this book being nonfiction it reads like a first class fiction suspense thriller with a sense of humor. In fact its Mohammeds humor that makes all of the horror palatable. His childhood is not easy and yet he shares the trials with quiet dignity. He is a truly remarkable young man. He is taught from an early age that Jewish people are the worst of the worst. Until one day he is given a Bible and he has to readjust his worldview  which he does. To an amazing degree.

I really enjoyed this book even given my general tendency to not read non fiction books. I think if more books like this were read and more people looked past labels like Muslim, Christian, Jewish and looked more at the person the world would be a much gentler place.

I got an English version of the book recently, and though it is a short novel, it has so much depth!

I feel like I could read this book over and over and get something new and different from it each time. There are certain quotes in this book that will spark your emotions, I don't think you can read this book without feeling something.

She spends her days watching old mystery movies, playing chess online, and counseling other people online who suffer from agoraphobia.  She lives alone in a huge house but has a tenant living in her finished basement.  This gives her a little feeling of security.

Anna has taken to watching her neighbors.  She has a high powered camera with a strong lens that allows her to see closeup into peoples windows.  Most of her neighbors think she is a kooky recluse and she doesnt know them well.  When the Russell family moves in, she is intrigued by new people to watch.

Anna drinks lots and lots of bottles of merlot wine.  She has cases of it sent to the house.  Along with the wine she pops a large number of pills for her mental condition that should not be mixed with alcohol.  She sleeps and roams the house at odd times.  Her psychiatrist is concerned for her knowing she is lying about mixing the pills with alcohol.

But the Russell family intrigues her and she spends more time watching them.  One night she sees something awful that terrifies her and she cant get anyone to believe her.  But she is relentless and continues to investigate what she saw until it becomes too dangerous.

This was a very good book that kept my attention.  I was totally surprised at the ending as I think other readers will be too.

As a friend said during a recent discussion, ""Dry is the point, I think. We are meant to be repulsed by it, and appropriately so.""

The story got lost in the overpowering message. And while oddly visionary, Orwell does not create likable characters. Winston was partially sympathetic, but mostly abhorrent.

The Author is also a poet and it is evident as the writing in both Spindle Fire and Winter Glass is often poetic and lyrical which really help transport the reader into this fairy tale/fantasy land of sisters Aurora and Isabelle. Princess Aurora has awakened and plots to kill the faerie queen Malfleur. Her sister Isabelle, unites her heart and kingdom with Prince William (YES!!) to wage war against Malfleur.

Both sisters have their own story-lines going with interesting characters such a Wren, who can hear Aurora when others cannot. Both sisters grow even more in this book and become stronger on their own and both learn about themselves and what they are capable of. One of the things I liked about Spindle Fire was the bond these sisters have and even though most of the time they are apart in this book, they still have a bond.

This book has a little bit of everything: romance, true love, evil characters, hope, strength, good vs. evil, magic, a glass (which isn't glass) slipper, and of course beautiful writing. We also get to see the good, the bad and the ugly in some of the characters.

Again, I thought Winter Glass was even better than Spindle Fire! Keep in mind that these two books are a fairy tale re-telling and they do not disappoint. I read most of this book in one day as I could not put it down. I just had to know how this series was going to end and how the Author was going to get us there! Winter Glass is captivating and sucked me in instantly and I had to keep turning the pages to see how it would end. The story-line is riveting and engaging. The pacing of this book is fantastic. Nothing felt drawn out and I never wanted to rush the story along.

I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",1523664000,4
8451,897,1642,"Very well written account of Dianne lake aka snakes time spent with Charles Manson and his followers : she was one of his followers at the time but not there the night of infamy. She seems like a decent person whose parents were too caught up in the free living sixties themselves to notice her descent into the arms of Charles Manson.

8452,807,413,I am so excited to have come upon this book.  I have always been a Crichton fan and enjoyed this book so much. I only wish there was more of his work to be read!,1523750400,4
8453,571,1965,"First I want to say that this is a book that I was really thrilled to get the chance to read. I fell in love with the cover the first time I saw it and I was intrigued by the blurb. And, I'm glad to say that the book was just as good as I had hoped it to be.

My Deat Hamilton is a massive novel, almost 700 pages and it took me around 2,5 days to read it. I was lucky enough to have a weekend off and let me tell you that it's the kind of book that that, despite the size of it, never get boring although I have to admit it the political side of the story was not my favorite part to read about, still I found it interesting to learn more about this period of time. My knowledge of Alexander Hamilton and his wife Eliza Schuyler Hamilton was not great before I started to read this book, which for me was a plus. I love not knowing too much sometimes when I read a historical fiction. Also, this book may have been about Alexander and Eliza, but I simply came to adore Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette from the very first time he appeared in the story. He's such a charismatic person that it felt like everyone around him faded a bit when he appeared. I might have a bit of a crush on him, to be honest.

As for the story, one can really feel that Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie have done their research and also managed to write a story that doesn't feel too long, which is a great thing because writing a book with almost 700 pages and managed to keep the readers attention all the way through is a great achievement.

I will end this review by saying that My Dear Hamilton is a fabulous novel which gives an insight into the marriage between Alexander and Eliza but also shows the foundation of the United States that we know today. And, the book also shows how good friends fell out and turned on each other...",1523750400,4
8454,24,1973,"The author has served her adopted country in several different areas previously and is highly qualified to stand by what she has written in this work.  In the first chapter is an introduction to Fascism and the proper use of the term as it relates to past and present governments.  Also she gives a brief glimpse into her early years and why this information is so very important especially at this time.  The next chapters gives the history of Benito Mussolini and how he came to power in Italy..next we move on to Hitler...the cold war, Stalin, the McCarthy hearings...examining governments in other areas of the world.  Chapter 15 examines The President of the United States and that is the most alarming chapter of the book.  Albright has totally exposed Trump for what he is and what harm he has done already and is doing.  There is no way any of the book can be fluffed off as fake news, not this time...with history to back her up there is indeed cause for alarm and every person in the United States should take this warning very seriously.  I also think it of interest to anyone in any part of the world to learn from this work, or at least read it and make your own decision.  Democracy is hard won and can slip away in the blink of an eye.  Personally I want to thank Mrs. Albright for writing this book, you are a light in a troubled time.

8455,1071,596,"Very different from much of Mr. Gaiman's work, this is a delightful and wistful realistic fantasy novel that I found fantastic. I didn't have many preconceptions going in, but anything I might have imagined was surpassed. A study of imagination and childhood, what we allow as adults, what we're capable of as children -- all wrapped up in a wonderfully detailed fantasy that could (if everything described existed, and I'm honestly not sure it doesn't at this moment) be a memoir. It's written as a memoir, but it's way better than most. An incredibly quick read because I simply couldn't put it down. At the end, I found a real tear falling down my cheek. That's rare for a fantasy, but it shouldn't be.",1523750400,5

8457,361,1957,"Mari is in London to find work and to discover more about her background. She was raised at an orphanage, but she recently received information about possible family. There's a lawyer who knows more, but she needs to find him first. She's looking for a job as a governess to earn a living. When she arrives at the agency she's being treated appallingly, but Mari knows how to take care of herself and immediately finds an opportunity. The Duke of Banksford is desperate, his twins have chased away all of their governesses so far. Mari is convinced she won't suffer the same fate.

Edgar might be a wealthy Duke, but he doesn't know how to make his children listen. When he meets the beautiful Mari he isn't convinced she has what it takes to be their governess, but Mari cleverly changes his opinion. She gets her chance and that means she'll be part of the Duke's household. Being near him proves to be a challenge. Edgar likes his governess, but he's a Duke and her employer, so knows he should keep his distance. Will he be able to resist temptation?

What a Difference a Duke Makes is an amazing entertaining romantic story. Mari is fierce, outspoken, confident and kind. I absolutely loved her sparkling personality and had to laugh out loud several times because of all the hilarious little Mary Poppins references in the story. There are some similarities, but definitely not too many and because I'm such a fan of Mary Poppins, reading them was a real treat. I enjoyed every single one of Mari's adventures. She's a practically perfect governess, she's cheeky, smart and amazing with children. She doesn't only change the childrens' lives she also makes sure she tutors their father in matters of the heart. I loved the chemistry between them and their strained conversations filled with Mari's wicked comments are fabulous.

Lenora Bell has written a fantastic book. What a Difference a Duke Makes has a huge feelgood factor. I had a big smile on my face while I was reading this book. It's charming, dazzling and dynamic. There's plenty of tension, there's a lot of unconditional love and there are many amusing scenes. Lenora Bell has written such a great book. She balances wonderful heartwarming cheerfulness with serious issues in life and that gives the story the exact right amount of depth. I absolutely loved What a Difference a Duke Makes, it's absolutely delightful.",1523750400,5

8459,1071,108,"The Great Gatsby doesn't need a review from me or anyone else in 2018, but on a recent reread, I found it very compelling in thinking about today's world. It speaks to many of the issues we're coping with even now -- namely the super-rich or 1% and the frivolity of wealth as well as the American Dream and what it all means. It's always been the quintessential Jazz Age novel, and while the styles still belong in that era, the take-away felt more current today than the first time I read it. Perhaps I've grown up, or perhaps reading more Fitzgerald, including his correspondence, knowing he was dealing with being unable to pay his bills while writing this novel made me look a bit further (or maybe I just read things in.) Either way, it's worth another read in 2018 and beyond.",1523750400,5
8460,296,321,"Are Shakespeare's plays really intended to be read...that is, by a lay-reader and purely for the purpose of a read? I suppose the reflexive answer is YES! But the read is always (to me) flat. I think the writing was intended as lines for his actors - to be performed on a stage, not read as a novel. I'll bet most people (no actual polling, mind you - who uses evidence anymore?) find the read of the plays...well dull. Part of that is the morphing of English over 400+ years which can make words and even thoughts obscure, but a large component, I suspect, is that the medium is not what The Bard intended.

Anyway - I blush to give The Bard of Avon, the greatest writer of the English language, a 3-star review. However, Hamlet was on my reading list (thegreatestbooks.org) but following reads of: Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury; or Virginia Woolf's, To the Lighthouse; or Ford Madox Fords, The Good Soldier; or Fyodor Dostoevskys Crime and Punishment or other masterpieces of that sort - Hamlet seems - 'three stars' by comparison!

I loved A Tale of Two Cities when I read it in school, but maybe because there was some actual intrigue and plot that one was just more interesting to me. This one just dragged on, filled with useless plot points about characters I did not care about, whose connections and actions, while in the end led to the secrets of Oliver's parentage being revealed, felt so removed from Oliver himself and took so long to explain that I sometimes began to wonder why it was called ""Oliver Twist"" when he barely did anything in his own life. Everything just happened to him. The only time he really did anything himself to further his own story was in the beginning, and everything after that was a result of someone else's actions.

Oliver himself was quite annoying. He was honestly a little too ""good"" for me, always crying over everything and loving everyone who was nice to him, and being so cheerful and hopeful and praying for everyone that I wanted to gag. I wished to see some other sort of emotion from him - some anger towards Fagin, or at his circumstances, or anything except the unending self-pity he seemed to constantly have. And all of the other characters were so one-dimensional in their personalities and emotions it was frustrrating. I think the only character I really enjoyed and who showed somme depth and character growth was Nancy, who struggled with doing what she was told and what she knew to be right.

I also know that this was written in the 1800s and that people were more open about their anti-Semitism back then, but why is it that Fagin is almost always referred to as ""the Jew,"" and that other Jews in the book are all evil and somehow easily recognizeable as being a Jew? It just made me cringe and my stomach turn every time I saw that word on the page, because it was always being associated with some distasteful.

Overall, I am glad to be finally done this book, which I had picked up because I both wanted to read more of the classics and also know the full story before picking up a retelling of it (which I don't know for sure if I will now). I am proud that I kept going with it, but I can say for sure that it is not one of my favorites.",1523750400,2

8465,821,1865,"Though I had heard great things about Madeline Miller's novel, The Song of Achilles, I never wanted to read it because the Trojan War is such a tragic story of pointless bloodshed and death. Recently, however, I read a stunningly brilliant short story by Ms. Miller titled Galatea. That piece was so powerful, I decided to give The Song of Achilles a try, and I'm glad I did.

Though I will likely never reread this book, (because the story itself is quite depressing), I continue to be impressed with Ms. Miller's ability to take ancient myths and bring them marvelously to life. She chose to tell the tale through the eyes of Patroclus, Achilles' sworn companion and lover. He is a more sympathetic character then most of the glory-seeking warriors, which helped me to stay with the story, even when it got to the bloody battles. Also the author chose to set Achilles' and Patroclus' relationship as the core of the novel, giving it a greater warmth and heart than it would otherwise have.

In addition, Ms. Miller managed to take the convoluted and rather odd aspects of the Iliad and make them seem plausible. She wove it all together into a cohesive and moving story that will remain  vividly in my memory for many years. Quite an accomplishment!",1523836800,4
8466,1075,1062,"I received my copy of The Last Mrs. Parrish by winning a PageHabit contest, which has no effect on my review.

I read this book to fulfill the prompt of A book by two authors (Liv Constantine is the pen name of sisters Lynne and Valerie Constantine) for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge.

The first part of this book is about con woman Amber Patterson, a young woman who resents having been raised in poverty, and resolves to find a way out, even if it means insinuating herself into the lives of millionaires Daphne and Jackson Parrish.

I hated the first half of this book.

HATED, IT.

Ambers motivations for everything were sketchy at best. I got tired of poor gold diggers setting their sights on married millionaires when Dynasty was still a thing in the 80s. All that was missing here was the two women wrestling and falling into the pool while wearing their elegant designer gowns.

I really cant say a lot about the plot because there were some twists and turns that some people might enjoy (and I don't want to spoil), so Ill just leave it by saying if you enjoyed Dynasty and Falcon Crest, this will feel like familiar territory for you.

The second part of the book was marginally better, but by that point it was too far gone to save. At that point, I felt like a very poor writer who imagined himself to be the next Sidney Sheldon had joined the Dynasty writing staff. I literally spent at least 200 pages of this book massaging my temples (to ease the headache it was giving me) with one hand while turning pages with the other.

Everything was far-fetched, the characters were caricatures, and I didn't care about any of them because I couldn't buy into the basic premise.

I will not be reading anything else from these authors, either on their own or together. One of the worst books Ive read in a long time.

8468,767,1966,"Peter Swanson has done it again. Crafted a suspense-filled novel in ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LIES. Harry, a college student, who is to graduate in just days, receives a call from his aloof stepmother, that his father has suddenly passed away. She thinks that he slipped and fell or perhaps had a heart attack while on his daily walk in the woods of Maine where they live. Harry immediately leaves school to come home. Awkward in this house that doesnt feel like home, he tries to make himself useful while still trying to wrap his head around the shock of losing his father. All the while, his stepmother wants Harry by her side.

At the funeral, he sees a mysterious girl, who later comes in to his fathers bookstore. Harry is curiously drawn to the girl. But who is she and why is she here.

After just a few days in town, both Harry and his stepmother, and the police, begin to think that the dads death was not an accident.

Harry certainly has a lot on his mind. Grief and now these two women.

By no means bad, I just didn't find it all that good. It goes fast, and has a ton of eccentric characters, all of which are pretty well typed up and easy to identify, but none that I really felt anything for. And Poirot, I know, is in dozens of these books, and Orient Express is his tenth appearance, but even he felt over typed and somewhat flat to me, just arrogantly sauntering through the novel like another train conductor. At times it struck me that I was reading a novelized play; as a fun side game I tried to connect  each of these characters with the different actors in the new film version. Sadly, Im hesitant to proceed with Christie, but am open to council. Perhaps Orient Express is a bad place to start. I selected it based on its continued success and notoriety, which perhaps is why it read so cinematically, as that notoriety is mostly driven by the many successful adaptations.

8475,2,5,"I was initially quite charmed by this novel and its titular heroine, whose difficulty with social cues and preference for a strict regular schedule would seem to place her somewhere on the autism spectrum. This diagnosis is never made explicit, however, and as the story goes on, it turns into an exploration of the main character's childhood trauma and a personal journey for her to get better. As a reader who agrees with the diagnosis inherent in the title that there isn't anything wrong with this character in the first place, it stings a little to see a narrative framed around making her fit in. (There's also a really atrocious twist in the final pages that I spotted from a mile off and still groaned at once it finally happened.)

There's enough in this novel to love that I can't bring myself to give it lower than a three-star rating, but I really feel like the back half of the book squanders the setup for what could have been an all-time great read.",1523923200,3

8479,367,722,"It would be easier to be a criminal fairly prosecuted by the law than an Indian daughter who wronged her family. A crime would be punishable by a jail sentence of definite duration rather than this uncertain length of family guilt trips.

Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows is the third novel by Singapore-born author, Balli Kaur Jaswal. Twenty-two-tear-old Nikki Grewal has found a job teaching creative writing to Punjabi women for the Sikh Community Association at the Southall Temple. This is a welcome development in her life as, with half a law degree and a job in a pub that looks less that permanent, she can do with another source of income. And facilitating these ladies in finding their creative voices speaks to her sense of promoting womens rights.

But the woman who employed her, Kulwinder Kaur has perhaps been less than honest: it turns out that most of these women cant read or write at all, Punjabi or English. When her basic lessons apparently bore the widows, they begin telling stories they know, have heard or made up. And not just innocent little tales, but erotic stories, just about the very last thing Nikki would have expected from the mouths of these respectable ladies. One of their number is literate enough to be their scribe: could their tales be published?

As Nikki becomes more familiar with her students, she realises that despite their candid talk, there is something they are not revealing. It has to do with a young woman whose death, fourteen years earlier, is still a mystery. Or is it really? As Nikki gains her students trust, she learns of another death, labelled accidental, and then the recent purported suicide of Kulwinders daughter, Maya.

One of her widows says: All those people who say, Take no notice of those widows. Without their husbands, they're irrelevant. Wed be invisible in India; I suppose it makes no difference that were in England. But news of the classes spreads among the women in the community and far beyond, and more students join the group; Nikki worries that the real content of their writing will attract the wrong sort of attention.

Jaswals novel explores many topical subjects for Indians living in Britain: parental pressure regards career or marriage partner; the vital importance of status and reputation in this community; and the powerlessness of women in the community are but some of these. She describes a culture that, in twenty-first century London, still condones or even promotes arranged marriages, bounty hunters and honour killings; a culture that is slow to react to modern times and difficult to change while is it perpetuated by the men in power and by some of the older, uneducated and often illiterate women.

While these are serious topics, Jaswal also gives the reader plenty of humour, much of it quite black, charming characters, natural dialogue and a rather exciting climax. As for the sexy little stories, they can easily be skipped if mild erotica is not to the readers taste, without affecting the flow of the main story. Funny, moving and thought-provoking, this is a great read!",1523923200,5

For the last several decades, I was sure that book had been A Wrinkle in Time. Now that Ive finished reading this, I realize that this wasn't the book I remembered. I love that each of the children is a quirky, unique individual, but I felt that their characterizations were a bit simplistic. Even children can be complex characters. To be honest, Im not sure I liked Meg at all. There was just something in her reactions that rubbed me the wrong way. That irritated me rather than making me want to know more.

8486,464,1975,"Cassandra Howell is a bluestocking and eminently proud (even boastful) of the fact that shes smart and bookish.  Shes also spoilt rotten, often selfish, consistently snobby and has a tendency to look down on those she feels beneath her (and many are as she is quite tall for a woman). In short, while I found Leone (from the first book) perplexing and a bit contrary, Cassandra encouraged few, if any, feelings that were positive, making her character one that needed redemption and some serious growing up to bring her to equal footing with the handsome and quite worldly Duke of Camberly, Soren.

Soren is what one would expect  handsome, a bit more patient with Cassandras boorishness and snobbery, and wholly determined to overcome the family history and restore the coffers decimated by Cassandras family.  Hes far more loyal to her than she deserves, and loyalty to his family and friends, sometimes to his detriment is one of the many things to enjoy about him.  Hes also clearly able to communicate his wants, needs and secrets to Cassandra, and after a bit of hesitation and the reveal of the secrets  their communication is solid. But Cassandra! Usually Maxwell is very much able to bring my initial impressions of a character around to positive  but it was a seriously hard slog here.

Totally unsuited for anything than what she was  a spoiled daughter free to pursue her own interests and an often grandiose estimation of her own intelligence and standing, while her family life wasn't perfect, shed not really provided a true sense for her own behavior  nor her intelligence. That felt way more told than shown, and while I was able to gather some sympathy for her when shocking truths about her family were revealed, my admiration and enjoyment of Soren in his single-minded determination to have and appreciate this woman are what made the relationship work for me.

Maxwell is one of my favorites when writing a flawed character, and most times they come to be easily understood and their flaws and behavior can be put into context when their secrets are revealed and they start to grow into the person that they were meant to become. I just didn't find enough change or growth in Cassandra to totally redeem her, and from the first to the last page it was Soren who engendered the empathy, admiration and brought the fun to this story.

Soren is need of a wife with money and thinks that Cass would make a good fit for his needs. Cass has been on the marriage mart for a few years and he fells the marriage would work toward her needs too.
Although their is a family history of upset it doesn't sway Soren thoughts of making Cass his wife.
Cass thinks she has feeling for the Duke of Camberly and is frustrated when Soren keeps popping up at the same functions as the Duke.

We were introduced to Cassandra in the first book of the series, If Ever I Should Love You, Three unimaginably rich wallflower heiresses (Leonie, Cassandra, and Willa) just cant seem to find a match, but they do find a great friendship with each other. In order to relieve the monotony of standing about a ballroom, they create a contest  each interaction with the Duke of Camberly gets them points. Different types of interactions gain different amount of points. The first book in the series is wonderful and deals with alcohol addiction. The author handles that very well and I admire her for tackling it  especially when it isn't the hero who is addicted. To me, this book isn't her best work and doesnt measure up to that first book. Im pretty solid on my 3.5 rating  my quandary has been whether to round up to 4 or down to 3. If I rounded up to 4, it would only be because I liked Soren so well  even though I did have a few issues with him. I usually avoid the trope where the hero was previously married and loved his spouse. That is great in the real world, but Id like the fairy tale in my romance books. I didn't realize that trope was in this book. I always feel like the heroine misses out on being first, her children never have a chance to be first, etc. Another thing that bothers me is that the villain really doesnt get any punishment  he gets away with everything. I absolutely dislike that in a book  as I said, I want the fairy tale. So, drop the villain down a mine shaft, have him fall off a cliff, make him walk the plank  whatever  just make him pay! Too many authors give the villains a slap on the wrist  or less.

Cassandra Holwell enjoys their little game of points, but actually, she really wants to win the heart of the newly minted Duke of Camberly because he is the one. So, why does Soren York keep popping up at every ball where she gets a chance to make points with Camberly. Why won't he get out of her way! Then, totally by accident, she is ruined and Soren is fighting a duel for her honor. After a confrontation with her father she and Soren marry and the rollercoaster ride begins.

The book begins at a house party at the country estate of the Duke of Camberly  Soren York, Lord Dewsberry, was determined to marry the Holwell Heiress. He needed her money. Desperately. The problem was, Miss Cassandra Holwell appeared equally tenacious in avoiding him. While it appears that his sole interest is the money, it really isnt. Hes been fond of Cassandra since they were children growing up in Cornwall. Their families are also longstanding enemies. There is no way they can marry, her father would never allow it.

After they marry, she realizes that she could come to care for Soren and that they could have a happy life together  in London  not Cornwall. Then, they are dealt some really hard blows and it would have been so easy for Soren to just give up or to resent her  but he doesnt. He is so very patient with her and  can you believe it  they actually talk openly and honestly with each other. In his case, some of it comes a bit later than it should, but at least it does come. Cassandra had a lot of angst about Mary, Sorens first wife, and I totally sympathized with her about that. Their road to their HEA is a difficult one, but their love is real and complete.

I thought the end was a little too neat and too quick. Rather than his Canadian business helping them, I would have preferred that the villain is forced to help  he could fall down a mine shaft and when they were recovering the body, they could discover gold or something. Id also like that lawyer they talked to in London to fall in a hole as well. Just because one old lawyer has died doesnt mean there would be no records or documents. Somebody would still have them.

We learn more about the Duke of Camberly in this book and Im not sure that is a good thing. I liked him okay in the first book, but this one makes me think hes a real twit. So, it might be fun to see if our intrepid author can redeem him and really make him into a hero in the next book. Time will tell!

The book is well written and I would recommend it  I just had some issues with a few things. My friend and I had a discussion about the rating and she felt what was said in the Authors Notes would move the rating to a 4. I didn't necessarily agree with that because the Authors Notes aren't part of the story and may not even be read by many readers. Had the author written those things into the story, then maybe I would have ended up giving it a 5-star rating.

At any rate  I am going to round up to a 4 because I really liked Soren and Cassandra. I hope you will read it and enjoy it.

8490,111,1975,"Soren York, Earl of Dewsberry, is really desperate for a wife; anyone with money will do, since the family coffers are empty, thanks to gambling relatives. Yet, Soren knows that he only wants Miss Cassandra Holwell for a wife. They were friends back home in Cornwall more than ten years ago; he likes her, he admires her independence, he finds her ever so pretty, and yes, she is also very wealthy. There is unfortunately the teeny tiny problem of their respective grandfathers being involved in a nasty incident, which Holwell pre will never forgive nor forget. Since Soren came back to London, Cassandra has been snubbing him, and he cannot fathom why, but she remembers all too well. Still, they manage to have a somewhat civilised conversation, and then the Duke of Camberly, whom Cassandra had been considering as a potential husband, involuntarily causes a major scandal which has the most unforeseen consequences.

Cathy Maxwell demonstrates once again her brilliance and her creativity when it comes to startling plot twists. Not a quarter into the book, and I was stunned, shocked, astounded, and very happily so! The characters are superbly well drawn: I felt sorry for Soren, yet he is not blameless in Cass hating him; he has secrets, but he is also lovely, sweet, determined to keep the family estate and at a loss at what to do. Cassandra is direct, a tad haughty, always on the verge of being humiliated by her father. Mr Holwell is but one of the splendid secondary characters; others are Matthew Addison, the new Duke of Camberly, and the Bainbursts, who appear briefly but whose presence is meaningful. Cass friend Willa Reverly also has her sights set on Camberley, I had just about fell in love with him myself until the catastrophe occurred, and I didn't know what to think anymore. I hadnt reached the first third of A MATCH MADE IN BED that I was nearly hyperventilating with excitement: I simply had no idea how this would all turn out!

There are so many lies, secrets, affairs, sacrifices revolving around Cassandra and Sorens romance, yet their romance is extremely passionate and realistic. I loved how a smouldering sensuality coloured their relationship without the need of dozens of pages of explicit sex scenes, their deep connection is expressed through actions and emotions. A MATCH MADE IN BED provides an insightful look into the moral hypocrisy of the Regency aristocracy, which in turns explains the bonds that link Cassandra and Soren. However, there was a family matter, that seemed somewhat superfluous, and was in my opinion a little too conveniently wrapped up towards then end, but it is a trifle when one looks at this marvellous novel. I had adored If Ever I Could Love You, the previous instalment of The Spinster Heiresses, and A MATCH MADE IN BED is just as fabulous, and entirely different. Cathy Maxwell amazes me with her stellar storytelling skills, her gorgeous writing, and her ability to keep me enthralled, intrigued, and in awe.

8491,248,1690,"Moore can be a polarizing writer because his humor occasionally veers sideways and his writing can be over the top.  But you know what- if you're looking for something different that will make you smile (if not laugh out loud) this latest is for you (and also if you haven't read him before.) I enjoyed his take on the noir genre, which has its own quirks, and think his effort was spot on. You get a mysterious alien, a bartender named ""two toes"" , a woman named Stilton, and an entirely implausible but highly entertaining tale.  It's told from several perspectives (and just who the narrator is will not be immediately apparent.).  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  This isn't for everyone but I enjoyed it, especially as a break from more serious thrillers and the evening news.  If Hollywood wouldn't ruin it.....",1523923200,4

His anonymous web site soon becomes the gotta go to on the web.  He recruits his best buddy for help and under his pressure they cash in on some of the prophecies.  Taking the money bothers Will. Everybody seems to want a piece of him and one very powerful individual spares no expense to start tracking him down. His predictions start causing major social upheavals adding to the pressure as chaos mounts and the death toll rises. He struggles desperately to stuff the genie back in the bottle. Superior world building,characters with depth and breadth that I could root for,lots of action with high stakes and consumate pacing make this one of 2018's solid winners.  Charles Soule is an experienced writer having honed his chops writing for comic publishers and also penned his own six part graphic novel(comic books for adults) series. The Oracle Year is his first 'normal' novel and it seems to have been a long time percolating because it came out a mature, solidly crafted, well edited work and a darn good read.

8494,184,165,"In Homo Deus Yuval Noah Harari provides a description of what he thinks the future will look like. He begins by saying that humans have been concerned with disease famine and war, but that now these problems have been largely solved and in the future the focus will be on immortality, bliss and becoming god-like.

He claims that humans are really organic algorithms and do not have a central core. Historically people derived their values and beliefs from a supernatural source (Theism), but that view has given way to Humanism, the idea that humans can determine their values without reference to some supernatural being. Humanism, in turn, is divided into three branches:
1. Orthodoxbelief in individualism, human rights, democracy, free will and free markets--liberalism
2. Socialiststate control, example is Communism
3. Evolutionarybelief that some humans are superior to othersexample is Nazism.

In the future the author sees two possible scenarios, which he terms techno-humanism and data religion, in the former machines become more powerful but humans remain in control to some extent. In the latter humans and machines merge and machines, as the superior form, take over and humans ceased to exist. We see some evidence of techno-humanism now, for example in driver-less cars and medical diagnosis. Dataism, the author says, is an emerging religion. The universe consists of data flows and the value of everything is determined by its contribution to data processing. Dataism puts together organic organisms as biochemical algorithms and machines as increasing complex electronic algorithms and removes the barrier between animals and machines. As the electronic algorithms outperform the organic ones, humans will become superfluous. He gives as an example the fact that present day humans have caused the extinction of many animals they regard as lower life forms.

I rate the book at four stars because it is an intriguing and interesting read. At the same time, it is a projection of what may or may not happen.",1523923200,4

8496,110,1966,"I have a feeling for most readers ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LIES is a book that will either seduce you or leave you wanting more. For me, I was instantly drawn into the narrative, but at times couldn't help compare it to previous books I have read by the author. The characters were interesting enough and the story had the some twists and turns. However, I kept wanting the author to kick it up a notch. The moments of pure obsession and the web of lies he gives his readers were so delicious. I just wanted more.

What I did like was Swansons writing. When this author crafts a story, I cant help but have the intense desire to greedily read as many pages as I can. There is a dark eloquence to his books which allow me to get lost in the words and descriptions he puts forth.

Here is the thing. Some books you will love more than others. I think readers generally understand that even though you love an author, not everything they write will resonate with you. ALL THE BEAUTIFUL LIES was an okay book for me. I was hooked on trying to figure out exactly what was going on, but it wasn't the home run HER EVERY FEAR was. Is Swansons latest worth a read? I think so. There are many elements to the story I believe will pull in a different audience than his previous books. I would even go as far as to say romance readers, especially romantic suspense fans, might like this book more than strictly mystery/thriller lovers.

All I know is I cant wait to see what the author gives me next. Knowing he is willing to push himself out of his comfort zone, I am excited for what is to come.",1523923200,3
8497,91,1028,"I've been a big fan of Tony Hillerman's mystery novels ever since I first discovered them 20-something years ago. My grandparents were living in Sante Fe at the time, and the whole family started reading the novels. I quickly devoured the whole series.

I was thus a little leery of reading ""Spider Woman's Daughter,"" a continuation of the series by Hillerman's daughter Anne. Later writers so rarely manage to live up to the standard set by the original author of an iconic series.

However, ""Spider Woman's Daughter"" proves to be a happy exception to that rule. Anne Hillerman has her father's knack for atmosphere, setting, and evoking a foreign yet familiar culture. As I am reading this entirely from the outside, as it were, I can't speak with too much authority about the actual authenticity of the Hillermans' depiction of Navajo culture, but it certainly *feels"" authentic to someone who spends a lot of time reading about and studying other cultures.

This is probably a good time to dive into the issue of cultural appropriation, which I'm sure some people are going to raise. Is it okay for someone who is not Navajo to make a lot of money writing about Navajo characters and Navajo culture? Some might say ""No,"" but most of what I know about Navajo culture, and most of the positive feelings I have towards Navajo culture and Native Americans in general, come from reading these books. Translators serve an important purpose, and one could argue that what Tony Hillerman and now his daughter Anne are doing is acting as translators of a sort, bringing Navajo culture to the wider, English-speaking world.

Anyway, fans of the original novels are likely to enjoy ""Spider Woman's Daughter"" as well. It is not, however, just a copy of Hillerman pere's work; Anne Hillerman brings her own fresh voice to the series, focusing more on female cop Bernie Manuelito and the women's side of Navajo culture. Certainly worth reading if you are already a fan, and also worth checking out if you want to read some mystery that's a little bit different from a lot of the mainstream fare out there.",1523923200,5
8498,566,1975,"When this book starts Cassandra Holwell, one of the Spinster Heiresses, is still intent on marrying the Duke of Camberly, but Soren York, the Earl of Dewberry has other ideas and with the help of the Duke and his grandmother, he sets out to win his heiress.

Cass has known Soren for years, they grew up together in Cornwall and their families are well known enemies. She has her own reasons for avoiding Soren, she knows he needs money, but she is not going to be the one who gives it to him! When he finally corners her and they talk, she begins to rethink her reasons for avoiding him, she likes Soren, but she can't marry him, her father would never allow it and she is still sure the duke is ""the one"". But later when she catches the duke in a compromising situation, she radically revises her opinion of him and isn't sure what she will do. But fate has decided for her, when while trying to evade other houseguests on the way back to her room, she enters Soren's room and is caught with a very naked Soren. He proposes and her father has a fit, threatening to disown her. She tells Soren she can't decide now and runs after her father.

Her father tells her she did the right thing by refusing Soren, she is ruined, but her family will not desert her, she can go back to Cornwall and live a quiet life of a spinster. Cass is not happy with this option, she wants to stay in London and hopes to never return to Cornwall. So when she learns that Soren is fighting a duel to preserve her honor, she decides he is the lesser of two evils and agrees to marry him, much to her father's disgust.

They marry and she is sure she has made the right choice, she begins to envision her future and the fruition of all her dreams coming true. But the road to HEA seems impassable for them when some startling truths are revealed and the detour leads them to Cornwall.

I really liked this book, but there were a few things that just didn't sit right with me, I couldn't believe that her father was the only one with a copy of her grandfather's will and I think Soren should have been upfront with her about his first marriage before he married her. I did enjoy seeing Cass transform from pampered princess to a true helpmate, I also commiserated with her feelings about his first wife and I didn't feel like Soren did anything to dispel her insecurities - (But, Ms. Maxwell's author note at the end made me feel a lot better and is the reason I decided on a four star rating vs a three star rating). I loved Soren, he was an almost perfect hero and I love how he treated Cass, his patience, understanding and positive attitude were a refreshing change from the typical HR hero. I loved that these two actually TALKED! I am not sure how I feel about Camberly, I liked him in the first book, but thought he was a bit of twit in this one and I feel sorry for Willa! I also felt like the ending of this story was just a little too quick and tied up a bit too neatly. But the book was well written, flowed nicely, had a lot of twists and turns, steamy love scenes, some shocking secrets and a villain that got off way to easy.

This is the second book in the series, but it could easily be read as a stand alone title. I am happy to recommend the book and am very interested in finding out if Ms. Maxwell can change my opinion of Camberly yet again.

8503,271,1690,"Usually when you read a book it has, you know, a beginning, a middle, and an end. That's sort of this book. But it feels more like Christopher Moore keeps a writer's notebook with ideas for books, sketches for scenes, and maybe some noodled funny bits. Looking at this, he created a funny, ironic, shop worn regular standup guy hero, and a very funny, very hot, new girlfriend, and just ran them through the notebook using whatever he came across. And it works, even if you end up with snake whiz, Area 51, Bohemian Grove hookers, crooked cops, Petey the Mamba, Men in Black, and lots of booze.

What makes the book so darn enjoyable is, first, the collection of supporting characters, which is easily one of the best buffets of crazy funny I've read in a while. They include a deadpan mellow Chinese pal, a kid mini-sidekick who sounds like one of the Dead End Kids, (or maybe a maniacal Munchkin), a cab driver who's afraid of driving since he piloted a tank in the War, a smart-mouth hash slinger, Lone Jones, (who is not black), and at least two dozen other great characters. On top of this, since we're doing a ""noir"" set in San Francisco just after the end of world War II, it's all done in a Damon Runyon voice, with that sharp and crisp, yet somehow laid back, urban rat-a-tat pacing that oozes color and style. (BTW, I thought this was Runyon-esque before I read the afterword by Moore in which he describes the book as Runyon-esque, so I still get full credit for this insight.) On top of that, this is sort of a love letter to post-War San Francisco, and if you are fond of the city you'll enjoy that setting immensely.

I get it that this isn't your usual Moore. He called it Perky Noir, which is fair enough, and as noted it has the wanders. But, the characters are a riot, the dialogue is fast and razor sharp, the humor is unforced and often sneaky, and the word play, or playful wording, is fast and furious. That made it an entertaining and happy read, which was good enough for me.

(Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book without a review requirement, or any influence regarding review content should I choose to post a review. Apart from that I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book.)",1524009600,4
8504,1071,76,"It starts with a bang then moves to a slow simmer that drags on too long, but once I pushed past that I'd fallen in love (and lost another night's sleep.)

Our protagonist, the fictional Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, may be one of the most charming main characters I've met in a while. Imprisoned in the Metropol Hotel for life when he's in his very early 30s, he maintains a sense of noblesse oblige and decency that never fails. From the Metropol we watch decades of history pass, but they aren't the story -- our Count and his ever-broadening circle of friends in the Metropol are. In this respect it feels suspiciously close to Eloise and the Plaza at times (and I'm seriously not kidding about that.)

The book is way too long to recap, but there is a constant examination of life and the people who are allowed to pass through the hotel's doors. Rostov makes the best of his situation and forms his own family of others within the hotel's walls. He is polite, generous and kind. ""...human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our reconsideration..."" He is, in fact, a gentleman.

If I'd read this before witnessing the pitchforked American mobs in the last decade, I'd say that the Count feels too American. He does have an indomitable spirit that feels more American than the brooding Russian themes he occasionally discusses. While he is steeped in tragedy and loss (his family is dead, his friends gone,) he is quite cheerful, incredibly smart and lucky. But if he'd been depressing, nobody would make it through this novel (which really does drag for too long.) Because he's a master of optimism and capable of true decency and growth, reading his story is nearly as pleasurable as meeting him would have been.",1524009600,4
8505,367,1966,"4.5 stars
All The Beautiful Lies is the fourth novel by American author, Peter Swanson. Twenty-two-year-old Harry Ackerson is about to graduate from college when his step-mother, Alice rings to tell him his father has unexpectedly died. He heads straight to Maine, overcome with grief. But an autopsy finds that Bill Ackerson was murdered. The bookshop owner had no enemies: who would have wanted him dead?

The widow, though, is acting a little strangely. Perhaps its her reaction to grief. Or perhaps his own grief is altering his perception. Then Harry meets Grace, a young lady who attended his fathers service, and the story she tells just doesnt ring true.

Swanson uses four narrative strands and two time periods to set up this clever thriller. It spans some twenty years, features a few red herrings, a great twist, an exciting climax and a surprise ending, by which time seven characters have met their death due to drowning, choking or being hit on the head with a cosh. The callous behaviour of some of those characters will surely leave the reader gasping.

Swanson makes his characters all the more believable by allowing them to lead normal lives for many years and only commit evil when the situation warrants it. Alice demonstrates the best way to get away with lying: keep telling yourself the preferred version of events until you actually believe it, after which its easy to be convincing. Sometimes this will require a fair bit of rationalising, something at which Jake is also an expert, to eliminate any feelings of guilt.

Swansons fourth novel is certainly a page-turner and just a few inconsistencies and some odd sentence structure, which should have been picked up by a good editor, prevent this from being a five-star read. Compelling crime fiction.

8506,578,1958,"I have to say upfront that I bought this book because of a personal connection to the city of Tangier in the same period (more or less) that the story is set.  The glowing reviews for the novel were a plus, but I was mostly interested in the setting.  That was a mistake on my part as the geography, demographics and history are more than a little off and really serve as stage backdrops for the interactions of the characters.  The story could have been set almost anywhere.  So, bottomline for any Tangier/Morocco aficionados out there--this book lacks authenticity to a degree that is distracting and off-putting.

As for the characters and other substance of the novel, there's not much there there.  The three or four main characters are thoroughly unpleasant, neurotic and sometimes downright amoral beings whose presence in Tangier (save for one) is never really explained.  The plot is transparently a sharp lean toward Patricia Highsmith with none of the built-in tautness and psychological shading.  The author focuses on threat and menace and sacrifices depth, in my opinion.  And back to my first disappointment with the locale--I got the impression that she has never set foot in Tangier.",1524009600,2

This story takes place about 10 years after the civil war was ended. Only, the civil war was not won by the North. Instead, there was a cease-fire to fight the rising dead on the battle fields.

10 years later, slavery has a new form in which almost every person of color is sent to combat schools in order to train to kill the ""shamblers"".

Jane McKeene is very good at killing shamblers. But, she is also clever. This gets her into trouble because white people don't like clever negroes that are good at killing.

Was it good?

I loved the characters, except for the ones I hated because they were exactly the right kind of villain for this story. (I mean, I think I was supposed to hate them.) I loved the world, and I loved the story. What I didn't like was that the ending felt too rushed. It's a lot of build up, and then you crash into a brick wall and the book is over. It's probably my fault because I went into this thinking it was a standalone book. It does appear now that there will be a second book.

8519,16,1901,"I love a good, fictional murder mystery and rarely read true crime. But I was eager to read I'll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara. It was the subtitle that grabbed me: ""One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer.""

McNamara was a journalist and the founder of TrueCrimeDiary.com. I say was, as she passed away before her book was published.

Michelle's instincts and drive for answers led her to delve deeply into the decades old case of a serial rapist and murderer who terrorized California for over the course of ten years.

It was truly fascinating to see the timeline, clues and hypothesis she built from her painstaking search.  McNamara pursued the tiniest of leads, coming up with connections that kept moving her forward. Her investigative skills were truly impressive. And along with fascinating, I'll Be Gone in the Dark is just as frightening. Definitely don't listen to this at night. Alone. By yourself.

The timeline of the book does jump around - keep an eye or an ear on the heading for each chapter. Despite that, it's not a problem to follow the story at all - it makes for riveting reading or listening.

McNamara offers up pieces of her own life in I'll Be Gone in the Dark. And for this reader, it was this personal aspect that had I'll Be Gone in the Dark encompassing more than simply a 'true crime' label.

I did choose to listen. Gabra Zackman was the narrator. She has a clean, crisp, no nonsense voice that matched the mental image I had for the author. Her inflection captures the tone and tenor of the content. An 'easy to to listen to' narrator that did a great job interpreting a not so easy narrative.

Gillian Flynn provides a great introduction to the book. And the title? ""He pointed a knife at her and issued a chilling warning: ""Make one move and you'll be silent forever and I'll be gone in the dark.""

The case remains unsolved......

(Gentle readers, this is not the book for you -  the cases are somewhat graphic in their detail.",1524096000,4
8520,951,76,"If you only want to read a book with page-turning suspense, rock 'em sock 'em action, and violence, this is not the book for you.  ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" was totally unlike anything I have ever read.  The word that came to my mind to describe the writing style was ""gentle"".  I had been told this book was about a spy, but it really was not.  It was about so much more.

The main character, Count Alexander Rostov, is sentenced in 1922 by the Bolsheviks to live out the rest of his life at the Metropol across from the Kremlin in Moscow.  If he leaves, he is to be executed.  He isn't allowed to remain in the suite there where he was already living.  He is instead given a 10' x 10' room.  He reminisces frequently about his childhood.

The fact that almost the entire book takes place in the Metropol does not make it boring.  It doesn't hurt that he has a master key for every door in the hotel that no one knows he has.  We meet all the people Rostov meets living there.  He forms special relationships with females of several ages.  He eventually becomes a waiter there where he is able to observe everything that goes on with private citizens, public officials, and state dinners.

This is a book of low-key intrigue.  I recommend it highly.",1524096000,4
8521,248,1978,"Well written tale of a dark period in Canadian history- when the children of unmarried women were considered to bear sin and even worse, were sent from orphanages to asylums because the nuns running the facilities were paid more to care for the mentally ill.  Set in 1950s rural Quebec, Goodman also touches on French-English conflict.  The novel tells, in almost alternate chapters, the story of Maggie who becomes pregnant and Elodie, the daughter she thought was dead but who was in fact put into the system after a failed adoption.  Maggie's story is one of determination to find Elodie, whose life is nothing but misery.  This is a grim tale in many ways but there are bright spots.  Thanks to Edelweiss for the ARC.  This is good storytelling.",1524096000,5
8522,373,1978,"The French word Elodie [El-oh-dee] means foreign riches. It is also a quite hardy type of lily; a suitable name for one of the main protagonists in Joanna Goodmans fourth novel, ""The Home for Unwanted Girls"". For, you see, Elodie was taken from, Maggie, her 16-year-old mother at birth, and raised in the cruelest of conditions in a Quebec orphanage rebranded in the 1950s by the government as a home for the mentally ill. What young Elodie goes through  Nay, suffers  as her mother spends a lifetime frantically searching for her, proves her profound will to survive. Her own hardy mettle. Just like her apt name.
The child of a mixed marriage between an Englishman and a French woman, Maggie wants nothing more than to work in her fathers garden shop. She dreams of one day owning and running it herself as she counts and packages seeds in the attic. As she grows older, she is enamored of Gabriel, a French lad, whom her father decides is not suitable for his daughter. To avoid further contact, he ships her to her uncles house, where she is brutally raped. As the resultant baby is ripped from Maggies arms just minutes after birth she has only a moment to name her daughter Elodie before she is taken away. Sold by her father on the then thriving baby black market. Thus sparkling a life-long dissonance between herself and her once beloved parent.
Elodie, at age seven, too young to understand or know any other home, thrives in the orphanage until it is declared a mental asylum. She is transferred to another institution where she meets the unthwarted and unwarranted wrath of only monetary-minded nuns. Injustice and cruelty prevail until she meets another sister who kindly takes her under her wing Awaiting the time when Elodie is grown; old enough to be cast out into the unknown outside world on her own.
Based upon real events and seething with exceptionally detailed and exhaustive research, Goodmans complex political narrative, with several surprising plot twists and intertwining sub-plots, is a cant-put-it-down page-turner that is guaranteed to keep readers awake at night. Waiting to see what happens next in Maggies multi-faceted life as she continues to seek Elodies whereabouts. Wanting to scream at the heartless nuns who run the orphanage turned asylum; who consider the young girl and her contemporaries nothing more than sub-humans. The children tolerated only because of government money given them each month for each incarcerated patient that fills their coffers.
Yes, folks. Just like our own current political times, the ancient adage has been, is, and will always be perennially true: Money is the root of all evil. And, perhaps, a basic strong theme of this revealing fictional recounting of the devastating damages that unbridled love of the all-mighty dollar can wreak. The subsequent evils spawn in Goodmans literary telling branches out to encompass the very heart as well as edges of the lives of Maggie and Elodie.
Told in the third-person, alternating chapters and sections between Maggie and Elodie, ""The Home for Unwanted Girls"" is not only a ripping expos of Canadian government greed and lack of political as well as personal compassion, but a study in misogynistic mentalities; revealing startling insensitivities toward female rights and respect. There is rape, incest, and the turning of deaf eyes and blind eyes. And, yet, Maggie and Elodie somehow survive. The branches begin to wither and die. True compassion and familial love eventually, finally win out.
To tell you anything more would border on spoiling this superbly written and well thought out novel for you. Except to say that the author is, indeed, a master craftswoman. One whose literary works should and must grace the library shelves of discerning bibliophiles.
Enjoy the read!",1524096000,5
8523,206,385,"I'm not usually a big fan of WWII-era historical fiction, mainly because it always leaves me feeling depressed. But this one was well worth the aftermath. It did a phenomenal job of establishing the environment in which Hitler rose to power and was able to implement such horrific acts. It's easy, from the perspective of the past, to assume everyone who believed in his rhetoric was racist, or ignorant, or just generally a bad person. But, of course, that's a gross oversimplification of a situation was *must* understand, lest we repeat it.

And you guys, reading some of the character musings on Hitler's programs, how he normalized horrible things...it hit pretty damned close to home. That wasn't even the focus of the book, it was just so powerful and well done that I fixated on it. This situation in which both ignorant peasants and educated elite agree with wonderful ideals that become darker and less idealistic over time. (Hitler's early toutings for landjahr, for instance, revolved around physical fitness, learning sustainable practices like farming, community, and music...that eventually clearly evolved into a more militaristic Hitler Youth situation, and his fixation on making children physically brutal)

So this is all reflected in the book, in the background. The primary story revolves around three widows, and their children, and a handful of years at the end and after WWII as they struggle to make their own community, survive, and essentially re-learn how to trust. The chief element is their humanity- all have regrets, impossible hopes, unrealistic standards, guilt and shame, etc. They are each incredibly relatable and real. And the story has enough bittersweet in it that for a time I wondered if it was partly based in the real life of someone the author knows.

If you can't tell from my rambling, I was impressed by the book and I recommend it to fans of fiction in general. Especially if you like historic fiction and/or bittersweet tales.",1524182400,5

For those of you that don't know, Mr. Moore is a very funny guy. But as good as he is at everything from concocting humorous situations to making you laugh out loud, he also tells a good story. His characters are likable and settings are well researched. This book is a good example, as I felt like I was really in 1947 San Francisco.

If you haven't read anything by him, ""Noir"" is a fine place to start, and I'm betting it will get you to read more of his work. If, like me, you're already a fan, I think you'll agree he came up with another winner.",1524268800,5

I picked up this book knowing how important it was, and I put it back down taking a good long look at my privilege and the ways that I can use that to empower others--especially minorities.

8527,350,385,"I love historical fiction, especially historical fiction set in WWII.  And I have read a lot of it.  Therefore, it is an extra treat to find a well-written book that sheds some light on a different aspect of the war and makes you examine your perspective.  The Women in the Castle is all of this plus an excellent page-turning story.  This is a book that I will be chatting about with others and encouraging them to read.

The book opens in Germany in 1938 with a party in an old castle.  The party is hosted by the owners niece-in-law, Marianne von Lingenfels.  She and her husband Albrecht are concerned about the actions and plans of Adolph Hitler.  Other party attendees are concerned as well.  The men are working on a plan, which turns out to be the July 20, 1944 plan to assassinate Hitler.  Marianne is asked to be the commander of the women and children.  The men are eventually captured and executed.  The story is Mariannes efforts to find the widows and children of these men.  She finds two of the women and their children and they all live in the abandoned castle.  However, the women are not necessarily as they seem and friendships and loyalties unravel.  The novel moves from the early rise of the Nazi party in 1923 to 1991 when Marianne is settled in the US and the castle is an educational institute.  I don't want to say much more for fear of ruining the experience of reading the book.

There is so much to love about this novel.  It was hard to put down and the writing is excellent.  I felt transported in some sections.  The characters are complex and interesting.  What I really enjoyed about this book was it provides some insight into how ordinary Germans became so caught up and mesmerized by Hitler.  It reminded me of All The Light We Cannot See in that regard, though I think that this book explores that question in more depth.  The book will leave you feeling a bit unsettled and with a lot to think about.  The mark of a great book, in my opinion.  This would be an excellent choice for a book club.

Maybe if I had of read it as a child I wouldve felt differently, the whole nostalgia factor. Having said that Im not sure it would even have appealed to me back then. I will say that fantasy is not a genre I read a lot of, but there are fantasy books I consider favourites. This novel was well written, with excellent dialogue, but it was the plot that had me struggling. It started strong  the first few chapters had me excited, and I really liked the Murry family, especially Meg and Charles Wallace, but once they started on their journey/quest things really fizzled out. I loved the sibling bond Meg and Charles Wallace shared, but SPOILER AHEAD, was disappointed that when they found their father he didn't seem to care much about them  came across as helpless and pathetic. Calvin cared for them more and hed only known them a couple of days, and he wasn't family. STILL IN SPOILER ALERT, it was stated that Charles Wallace had some kind of special powers/advantage, but when it came to facing the big evil,  IT easily gained control of him? Furthermore, it felt weird to me that, Charles Wallace, such a young child spoke like an adult. I mean he wasn't even school-aged? Was that why he was considered special? I did like that Meg stepped up and saved both her father and brother, rather than relying on a boy/man to save her. The reunion scene at the end was cute, and brought tears to my eyes, so maybe I was more invested than I thought. I wish I had more positive things to say as I went in expecting great things. I will be interested to see how it translates into a movie, and how many changes they make",1524268800,3

At one time Dr. Anna Fox - 38-years-old - was a successful child psychologist living in a renovated four-story Manhattan townhouse with her husband Ed and school age daughter Olivia. Now Anna is an agoraphobic who can't leave her home. Ed and Olivia reside elsewhere, and Anna lives alone except for her cat Punch, and her tenant/handyman, David - who rents the house's basement maisonette. Since Anna is housebound, she gets her medication, groceries, produce, wine, and other needs delivered.....and David takes care of trash and routine maintainance.

Anna calls Ed and Olivia every day, always opening the conversation with a cheery, ""Guess whooooo?"" Anna misses her family terribly, and delights in these daily talks.

Though Anna is confined, she's not averse to seeing people, and her doorbell rings frequently - heralding visits from her renter David, her physical therapist Bina, her psychiatrist Dr. Fielding, and her new neighbors, Alistair and Jane Russell and their teenage son Ethan. The Russells just moved into a multimillion dollar townhouse across from Anna's house, and the agoraphobic has a clear view into their residence from her windows.

With all this traffic through her house, you'd think Anna would take care of her appearance, but the psychologist takes A LOT of medication - including powerful psychotropic drugs - and drinks AT LEAST a bottle or two of Merlot a day (which is strictly contraindicated with her meds). Thus Anna is usually 'impaired', and often wanders around the house unshowered, in a grubby bathrobe and slippers.

Anna occupies her time playing online chess, taking computer French lessons, visiting a chat website for agoraphobics, and watching vintage suspense movies - especially Hitchcock classics. Anna's favorite activity, though, is spying on her neighbors with her Nikon telephoto camera.....and data mining them online. Thus the psychologist knows all about her neighbors' education, jobs, income, day-to-day routines, spending habits, food preferences, favorite television programs, book clubs, romantic affairs, and so on. (If I had a neighbor like this I would buy blackout curtains!)

After a visit from her new neighbor Jane Russell - during which the women play chess, tour the house, and drink 3 or 4 bottles of wine - Anna thinks she's made a new friend. Things go south, however, when the psychologist sees a violent occurrence in the Russell household. Anna calls the police, but the Russells deny that anything happened, and NO ONE believes the 'delusional' agoraphobic. One male detective tries to be kind but his female partner is especially cruel, and makes it clear she thinks Anna is an attention-seeking liar.

The psychologist is positive she saw a crime, though, and sets out to look for evidence. Anna makes it her business to investigate the Russells, and proceeds to accuse everyone in sight of various misdeeds. Meanwhile, strange things start to happen to Anna, which she can't explain. In part, this is the agoraphobic's own fault, since she overshares online. You'd think an intelligent woman with a Ph. D would know better.....but maybe it's the drugs and alcohol.

As the story unfolds we find out what led to Anna's illess and what secrets the Russells are hiding. Eventually, everything comes to a head in a dramatic - though VERY drawn out - denouement.

For the most part, I enjoyed the book. The portrayal of Anna's debilitating syndrome is realistic, and I found her to be a (mostly) sympathetic protagonist. The other characters in the book are also well-drawn, and the story is compelling.

I do have reservations about (what I consider to be) huge holes in the plot. These are spoilers, so if you haven't read the book you might want to skip this part.

SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT

[First.....haven't these New York detectives ever heard of fingerprints? When there's a question about whether someone was inside Anna's house, the police should just dust for prints. Even if it's just to humor the 'delusional' agoraphobic. Fingerprints (or the lack thereof) would prove the matter one way or the other.

Second.....There are VERY STRICT hipaa regulations about doctor-patient confidentiality. In the book, Dr. Fielding (moronically) blabs all about Anna's condition to the cops. Psychiatrists are NOT PERMITTED to do this. I was ABSOLUTELY AGHAST at this breach of professional responsibility!!

Third.....When the cops learn about Anna's diagnosis, they proceed to talk to her about it in front of David and the Russells. WTF?? The police shouldn't have this information to begin with, and CERTAINLY HAVE NO BUSINESS discussing it in front of the whole neighborhood.

If it was me, I would sue the crap out of the psychiatrist and the cops. (hide spoiler)]

END SPOILER ALERT / END SPOILER ALERT

In spite of my reservations, this is one of the better mysteries I've read recently. I had an idea about the book's climax - and I was right - but this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the story. I'd recommend the novel to fans of psychological thrillers.

8534,237,1505,"SOMETIMES I LIE isn't a bad book (although it does irritate me that so many book titles contain the ""lie"" word lately). But this book is overrated.

Amber is in a coma, although she can hear what others around her are saying. First she feels one way, then she gradually remembers more and more.

Claire, Amber's sister, seems fine, then not fine, then good, then bad, etc. And so it goes with all the characters in this book, including Amber. Also, most of the characters, including Amber, are unlikable.

Told In ""Before,"" ""Now,"" and ""After"" chapters, including diary entries, SOMETIMES I LIE should have you confused about everyone in it. But it is not unputdownable. If you've heard that it is, lower your expectations.",1524355200,3
8535,799,464,"I didn't get anything out of this book. The main message gets lost because of irrelevant stories and further discussions/ramblings of philosophy topics. If you already know what Buddhism is then you likely already get the key concept. It seems like the target audience for this book are young entitled millennials, which I am not.

The NYT review writes ""backed by academic research,"" which is not true. There is nothing scientific or academic about this book. It seems like a relatively young guy who is trying to figure out stuff on his own after messing up early in life. People over the age of 30 should already know concepts like choose your battles, relationships are important, and you cannot accomplish everything that you want to.

8537,826,468,"Andy Weir relies on the same tools he used in The Martian to tell the captivating story of Mark Watney rescuing himself from Mars to tell us the less captivating story of Mark Watney err Jasmine Bashara extricating herself from a an admittedly more complex but less interesting plot (partly of her own devising)  and save the moon along the way.

Theres no question that Weirs formula works. Even if his main character is pretty much the same here as in the last book, it doesnt matter. Jazz is funny, likeable, has a history that sets her enough apart from Watney to feel different, and the supporting cast of characters  just like in the Martian  are used brilliantly. The pace is fast. The science is deep enough to be interesting but not too deep as to bog things down. So what went wrong?

Well, nothing really went wrong, per se, this is a moderately enjoyable novel. But where the stakes in the Martian felt real, they didn't in Artemis. They felt trumped up. It seemed to me that maybe Weir had to deliver something to his publishers before he had something to deliver. Artemis has a written on demand quality to it. Theres also just the fact that the caper here on the moon is pretty convoluted, and Jazzs role in the whole thing is somewhat circumstantial. The story just doesnt hold.

When Artemis came out, I knew I would buy and read it. The Martian was just too astonishing of a success not to. But when I read the premise, it really didn't interest me that much, so I bought and read it 100% on the promise of the Martian. Next time around I probably wont. If  Weirs next book  sounds like my cup of tea, sure, Ill pick it. But if it seems like another going-through-the-motions tale, Ill take a pass.",1524441600,3
8538,929,468,"I did enjoy Artemis, which is the name of the lunar colony. This is a caper story. Several bits cropped up that I didn't like, or couldn't agree with, but others have probably pointed them out already. Like Artemis not having a fire department; but the colony takes fire safety seriously. Yes? In the one and only colony, where are people going to go if there is a fire, especially with tankfuls of oxygen piped into the air? Why no dedicated fire department?

The tale starts with tourism and smuggling, continues through lawbreaking and welding, ends with politics. Jazz is our guide, a not very likeable female version of Slippery Jim diGriz. I would have liked more descriptive writing about the lunar surface (kept picturing brown and yellow from The Martian) and thought Jazz's boasts about extra strength in the lower mass world unfounded, since muscles and bones would atrophy. But the technical details and exploits, with a few capers, were good. Nice to see a woman welder. I felt disappointed that in this future a better walking aid than crutches couldn't be found. Overall it's entertaining.

Anna Fox is a child phycologist, due to an emotional trauma she is now impaired by agoraphobia.  Her limited life is lived vicariously through spying on her neighbors. She sees more than she can handle when she watches a woman being murdered.  Due to her mental problems and her excessive drinking----she is not believed.

I had my own version of what this painting entailed as I read the novel but as I viewed the actual image, the landscape felt more void and lonely than I had anticipated.  Christinas image was ideal as she laid out on the harsh grass and the homesteads deteriorating condition completed the print.

I felt for Christina throughout the novel as she stumbled to keep up.  She kept her struggles inside as her determined and steadfast attitude pushed her through each day.  Christina felt unattractive and when you added on her leg condition that brought on her clumsiness and her constant stumbling, Christina had a negative view of herself. She was smart, her teacher had told her so, but living on the homestead she didn't feel it. Her legs cause her constant pain yet when her parents try to get her medical help, she refused it.  Its rough out on the homestead without any modern conveniences yet Christina doesnt complain, she does what is expected of her.  When all her friends start dating, getting married and having children, Christina imagines such a time but somehow, she knows her life is on her familys estate. I was sad to see Christina, day-in and day-out laboring away for her family and only taking time for herself if there was any, at the end of the day.

Andy Wyeth comes to Christinas homestead as he wants to use the surrounding area in his paintings. Andy becomes a constant figure in the household, using the upstairs bedroom for his studio.  I enjoyed the relationship that Andy and Christina develop through the years. They discover how the two of them are alike and their conversations become personal and relaxed.  Andy gets married and Christina finds a man who fills her heart.  She wonders how Walton will fit into her world as their worlds are so different. Is this her opportunity to leave the estate and start her own life?

I found myself absorbed into Christinas life.  I wanted so much for her.  When her teacher extended an opportunity to her, I was hoping that this would be where she would succeed and she would be off. I would only hope.  I loved Christinas relationships in this novel.  They weren't tight but she had a nice variety where I learned a bit more about her from different individuals.  I really enjoyed the authors writing, there was this, this is how it is feeling about it and I brought my own emotions to the table as I read.  I really enjoyed how the painting was used in this novel and I am glad I didn't look at it until I finished reading the novel. I think my parents had a copy of this painting when I was growing up, hanging in the hallway.  You can read the interpretation of this painting, invent your own, or read this novel and apply it to this painting, its up to you.  Super novel to read.

8543,649,269,"The reviews shown on the product page for dozens of different Frankenstein editions offered by Amazon are the same. The version reviewed below is the ""Oxford World's Classics"" hardcover edition first published in 2001, with an introduction by Jeffery Deaver.  This is a very compact edition about the size of a mass market paperback, but of high quality.

The text itself is that of the original 1818 version. The 15 pages of commentary in the Deaver introduction is reasonably worthwhile, exploring a few thematic ideas that might not occur to the untutored reader.

Certainly, anyone picking this up is already aware that it is a classic that has never been out of print in its 200 year history. But will you like it? Hard to say. Over the years, I've viewed countless theatrical treatments called ""Frankenstein"" and none that I remember even faintly resembled this book, so those hoping for the print version of some movie they've seen may be surprised. The book is very different from what has become the popularized image. For starters, popular culture mislabels ""the Monster"" (who is otherwise unnamed) as ""Frankenstein,"" but this is the surname of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the monster's creator.

The novel makes it clear that the Monster is an 8 foot giant, and gives just a few details (very strong, ugly, repulsive in appearance). But the pegs sticking out of his neck and his tall flat forehead, which common portrayals in modern artwork show, are never mentioned. He also has plenty of dialogue throughout and speaks intelligently, rather than in grunts and groans. He experiences complex emotions like a normal human being.

The story is written in a Gothic style not unusual for early 19th century literature. Although it moves along fairly well, I did not feel the suspense I expected from it. One of the major themes for me was the horror and rejection of the Monster by everyone, including its creator, based solely on its repulsive appearance. People reacted badly and drove him out without even allowing him to speak and show that he was (originally) a benign individual. His universal rejection by others is what ultimately drives him to his horrible crimes.",1524441600,4

5 Stars

A Scandalous Deal felt innovated and fresh in a genre that by definition is antiquated. I read the novel feverishly, not realizing how quickly I blew through it until I hit the ending, since nothing broke my concentration.

Two new things for me: I'd never read a book that began with a ship passage from England to NYC and I've read very few books taking place in the US during this era. This was a pleasant surprise, adding lawyers of originality.

Equality is the driving force for the premise. Eva is her father's daughter, using his notoriety as an architect to pose in his place as his health declines. There is an altruistic need, as Eva has to afford to pay for her father's care, since the man was not a money-miser.

While on the passage to New York, Phillip is playful, free with his laughs, and laid-back. When he arrives back in NYC, the gruff, exacting builder emerges- a man of those times.

Not wishing to spoil the details... Eva is filled with secrets and lies, when Phillip doesn't abide by either after being burnt in the past. Eva wishes to have a career, using the gift she's honed since a child, not wanting to go from her father's daughter to her husband's wife, with no identity of her own.

Eva isn't a damsel in distress, nor is she the forced feeling of the 'spunky' spitfire- she earns her place by doing as she said she'd do, using her wit and intelligence to reach her goals.

Instead of a balance, where one is exacting and the other is playful, I feel the two exacting intellectuals draw out the playful, passionate side in one another. The novel is high on tension, the spark igniting immediately, but slow-building when it comes to trust, intimacy, and love.

There is an underlying thread, featuring a female friend of Phillip's that I appreciated seeing brought to light, showing the accuracy of what would have happened to her if she hadn't had a friend like Phillip.

Joanna Shupe is a new-to-me author. After devouring A Scandalous Deal, I'm looking forward to going back and reading her backlist.

Highly recommended to historical romance fans who appreciate today's world views taking shape back in the past, as not every woman was comfortable in their station, especially as this takes place during the women's suffrage movement.",1524528000,5
8545,236,1979,"A Scandalous Deal by Joanna Shupe is book Two in The Four Hundred series. This is the story of Eva Hyde and Phillip Mansfield. I have read the previous book but feel if you choose to read this one first you should be okay.
Eva is the Lady Unlucky when she looses three fiancs to death and now her father illness is getting worse. Eva's father is a famous architect who has an assignment to design and oversee Phillips Hotels in America. Eva has been trained by her father and in fact has been covering for him for a while now so she goes forward to go to America to do the job. Phillip and Eva have a encounter where they shared a initiate night together and Eva left before he awoke. Thinking never to see him again she is shocked to learn later that he is the man she is going to be working for. Phillip tries to keep things professional as they can be between the two but that doesn't work out to well.
Will the Unlucky Lady find her luck?
Really enjoyed this story!",1524528000,5
8546,18,1979,"While this is a series, each book works entirely as a standalone. In A Scandalous Deal, Shupe gives us a feisty, modern thinking young woman and a forwarding thinking hero worthy. Sexy, relevant and low on drama A Scandalous Deal will transport you in time from the comfort of your reading chair.

Fans of historical fiction, romance, strong and innovated free-thinking female heroines and the men who are worthy of them will enjoy slipping into A Scandalous Deal.",1524528000,4
8547,194,1979,"Probably the sexiest book of Joanna Shupe's so far, in my opinion. Chapter 2 is a highlight for me with its combination of humor and high heat.

I like Eva's strength of will and her unwavering self-belief. But for me, Phillip had the most growth arc in this book with his acceptance of the changing roles of women in his world.

As always with Joanna's Gilded age setting, I adore ""being there"" at the time and place of A Scandalous Deal because she describes them exceptionally well.

I prefer for the deception to have been revealed much earlier, but I also appreciate the grand gestures both characters employed to get back together.

I give kudos to Joanna for being so very inclusive in her books, particularly this one. I also appreciate its feminist bent.

Overall, an enjoyable read.",1524528000,4
8548,129,1979,"I had enjoyed the first book in this series and was excited to get this one.

I loved Eva and Phillip. Shes smart and stands up for herself. Hes stubborn and maybe a bit cocky. Together theres a load of chemistry and button pushing. It was especially delightful to see Nora and Julius from the first book.

Plot wise, it was okay. Theres a lot of push and pull and while these two talked and talked often, it was never about what it needed to be. I loved all of the mentions of working women and the women supporting women. One of the best scenes involved Eva bringing in female family members.

Overall, it had a bit more deceit and miscommunication than I wanted, but I loved these characters. I cant wait to read the next book.

8549,248,1980,"Sigh.  Ella from Ohio has won a Rhodes and has landed a position advising a woman running for US President.  I have to admit that I actually liked the first half of this novel, which focused on Oxford, more than the second, which went sideways into a romantic relationship with Jamie, who is ill.  Whelan has made good use of her time in Oxford- she's mentioned a lot of the spots tourists will visit, provided the correct pronunciation of Magdalen, and hit some secret pleasures there (although I wish she had added the Pitt-Rivers.)  Her friends are the quintessential Oxonians and Jamie, well, he's the dashing man.  Ella appears to completely abandon her studies (and he's the only tutor ever mentioned) once she's wrapped in Jamie's world.  Don't get me wrong, the romantic aspects of this are quite nicely done and Jamie's illness is not sugared over.  It wasn't till I'd finished and read the author acknowledgements that I realized this is soon to be a movie- and is actually an adaptation of the script.  I suspect the novel will be better than the movie, if only because Whelan has a nice writing style and the small details read so well.  Thank to edelweiss for the ARC.",1524528000,5
8550,1127,503,"I always pushed this book aside thinking it was a romance. It kept popping up on my recommendations as historical fiction and I decided to give it a try. WOW! I loved it!

8551,816,1965,"I love the Dray-Kamoie writing duo. I think I've learned more from these two ladies than I did in my entire high school American History class. That is just sad. But their captivating writing draws me in and keeps me turning the page (until 3:30am consequentially). I only wish more authors of history books wrote in this storytelling style as we would surely retain more than I did from the bare recitation of facts in a history book.

My Dear Hamilton is the story about Elizabeth Schulyer Hamilton, the wife and champion of founding father, Alexander Hamilton. Told from Eliza's point of view, we get an intimate and eye-opening glimpse into the life of a great, but flawed, man. We also see the strength and courage of a female patriot of the time, working to support her husband through thick and thin, despite danger, strife and betrayal. I have the utmost respect for Eliza, truly one of the mother's of our great country.

Alexander Hamilton struggled with many things in his life, but mostly got lost in his ambition to overcome the stigma of his illegitimate birth. At times it seemed that Hamilton cared more for his ambition than those around him, but you could never deny that he was a true patriot and loved his country. Probably one of his greatest faults was his temper and unwillingness to overlook a slight. Once you became an enemy of Hamilton, it was a grudge that he held forever and often went out of his way to exact revenge. Unfortunately, others often got hurt in the process, and Eliza was the one getting the shaft on more than one occasion. Much like the last story, America's First Daughter, the authors didn't pull punches when it came to the founding fathers. They put it everything on the page, warts and all, and, as a result, we obtain a more well-rounded picture of the men who have been placed on historical pedestals. Does that take away from their greatness? Sometimes. But it also makes them more relatable human beings.

So much of what I want to talk about in this review would probably be a spoiler... in as much as you can spoil historical events. But for those who aren't familiar with Hamilton, they would probably prefer to obtain their information from the story than my review.

Things that I didn't know about Hamilton, I learned after his death (in the book) right along with Eliza. While there was a small amount of foreshadowing, I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. I couldn't imagine being in Eliza's place. Is it better to learn of these things in life, or after everyone has left this mortal coil? Who do you rage at when they are not there? While I already admired her person and accomplishments, her strength in holding things together for her family amazed me tenfold. For a woman who suffered the death of children, parents and husband in such a short time, I don't know how she didn't fall apart.

I was glad that the story didn't end with Hamilton's death, as Eliza outlived him by nearly 50 years. She went on to continue her philanthropic deeds, founding charities and schools and even keeping her finger on the political pulse of the country. And while her faith in Hamilton was temporarily shaken, we come to realize right along with her character that a man can have flaws and commit sins, but still be a great and yes, honorable, man. You can't deny Hamilton's contributions to America, and now I am glad to know all the things his wife did for family and country.

I voluntarily reviewed an advanced copy of this book that I received from the publisher, William Morrow. I can't wait to see who these authors write about next. I think I'm most interested in Dolley Madison, but I hope to also one day see a story about Mary Todd Lincoln.",1524528000,5
8552,565,1979,"This is my honest unbiased opinion. Thank you to Edelweiss, the publisher and the author for this ARC.

This is the second in the fabulous Joanna Shupes amazing Four Hundred series.
This story starts off with a bang, Lady Eva Hyde is on ship to New York. Shes
determined to carry through her fathers last architect contract, shes been overseeing and dealing with since his illness. Time away from London will stop the gossips and her moniker -Lady Unlucky - about the unfortunate situation of her string of dead fiancs.
An encounter with a sinfully attractive man on the way to New York turns complicated when she meets him again. Hes none other than Philip Mansfield!
When Eva sets the rules that she will not mix business with pleasure Philippe has other plans for them, because truthfully he cant keep his hands off her.

This was a decadent story full of passion, mystery and a heroine that has backbone. Philipe wasn't shy to stand and support the woman he loves, even though he was reluctant in the beginning. Sinfully, deliciousness in every page!
Joanna Shupe crafts an absorbing passionate tale in The Gilded Era! I highly recommend this!",1524528000,5
8553,864,1980,"I don't know what I expected when I agreed to read this book but I can tell you I got something I didn't expect. I thought Id be reading more of a coming of age tale but at least in my opinion what I read was a romance.

Ella is a young woman who has had her life planned since she was 13  she would work hard, get good grades and get a Rhodes Scholarship. Why? An article she read at that impressionable age gave her a glimpse of Oxford and she never forgot it.

Ella is a young woman of high intelligence and is very driven in her chosen field of education policy. As she is entering England for her year abroad she receives a call that can change her career path; to work on the campaign for a woman running for President. She does not want to give up her Rhodes so they work a way for her to consult remotely with a commitment for her to fully join the team at the end of her term.

As she explores her new living situation and meets friends Ella also engages with a professor. Their initial meeting is very antagonistic but sparks fly and soon they dating without strings. But then something happens to change the course of both of their lives.

Im not going to spoil plot points  you know that by now. I will note that I enjoyed reading My Oxford Year. I will also note that it was not a really deep read. I actually read it waiting for a flight and then on the flight from Kansas City to Salt Lake. It didn't take long; it read very quickly. It made for a great airport/plane book, if truth be told. That being written it just didn't leave me with any lasting impact. I read it, I enjoyed it and I promptly forgot about it as I turned to my next book.

The characters are likable, the plot has a couple of twists but nothing earth shattering. It was just a good, quick, easy read.

8554,644,1980,"My Oxford Year is a very enjoyable, well-written work of women fiction/chick lit and it's exactly the type of book I love to read. Its a sweet love story between young idealistic American woman, Ella, who comes to Oxford for her post-graduate degree and gorgeous and a little mysterious local, Jamie, who happens to be her literature professor, and who makes her fall in love with him and his city.
Two things that I loved most about the book are the setting and the dialogue. Kudos to the author for bringing Oxford to live on the pages of her book. I could easy picture myself exploring the streets of the beautiful city with Ella and Jamie. The dialogue was smart, funny, and engaging. It is such an important part in developing the story and the characters, and it shined in My Oxford Year.

The movie adaptation is already in development and the rumor is that Outlander's Sam Heughan will play Jamie. I was imaging Sam as Jamie while reading the book and I really hope we will get to see him in the movie. I just can't wait to see the film.

8555,464,1980,"Political policy writer Ella has it all: an up and coming career with a wonderful reputation, an offer from a rising political star and her year in Oxford courtesy of the Rhodes scholarship where she intends to immerse herself in literature, culture and the lectures of a renown academic. Everything in Oxford is different  the walking, the stairs, the sights and sounds: a neighbor using Wildes pseudonym as introduction, a never ending series of calls from the campaign- needing insight, input and even just touching base  and her mothers increasingly frantic please check in emails have her torn between exploration and hiding.  Sure, things are different  and her first lecture is full of gaffes  no syllabus, using Oxfordian rather than Oxonion, the lecturer being a substitute  the same man who nearly ran her down in the street..

I grabbed this title simply because Oxford (or the Other Place) has always fascinated me: the age, reputation, the simple ability to be where some of the eternal names of literature spent time. So I expected to enjoy the book simply because of that. And then, Whelan captured my imagination with Ella and all she was seeing: her determination to make the most of her time until she left the following June. With her flirtations with Jamie that soon morphed into more, her new friends  outrageously different and quirky, and balancing her life with school work, campaign demands and time for herself.

Highlighting Ellas growth and understanding of herself and learning that some things are meant to be felt, not simply experienced in remove  a tactic shes used since her fathers untimely death when she was 12.  Jamie pushes her to feel the emotion in the poems  to see that everything that she is reading is of, for or about love  for it is the ultimate toll-taker  a toll that she may not be willing to see the cost of. But when her relationship with Jamie starts to solidify just as he is then asking for a break, the relationship that was no strings and honest starts to be anything but for her  and his secret is revealed. There are choices we make, and other circumstances that are thrust upon us without consent  and its the steps made after  scary, unknown and often emotionally costly steps that are in the way to happiness and fulfillment. All steps that Ella, in her new place with her new understanding of herself and her wants, needs and dreams must follow.  Not precisely an HEA ending, but one that leaves everyone better off and richer for the experience  the story was a read in one sitting book, remembered for the lesson of love and the emotional impact.

8556,566,1979,"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book!

Lady Eva Hyde, daughter of the famous architect E.M. Hyde, Lord Cassell and the holder of the unfortunately nickname Lady Unlucky (because of her 3 deceased fiancs) is on her way to New York to oversee the biggest project of her career. Too bad everyone believes it is her father's design.

Eva meets Phillip on the ship, she literally runs into him she introduces herself as Evelyn and helps him with his sea sickness, days later during a storm, they meet again and after too much champagne, they share a passionate encounter. Phillip tries to find her the next morning, but she is gone.

Phillip Mansfield is the owner and developer of the hotel, the Mansfield Hotel will be his legacy, he has hired only the best for the project, including famed architect E.M. Hyde. He is back in New York and ready to start his hotel project, but he can't stop thinking of Evelyn, so when she arrives on his job site, he is shocked and then angry when he learns who she is. Phillip cannot abide deceit, he has been burned by a woman before and has a real problem trusting any woman. He takes Eva back to his office and learns that her father is ill and sent her in his place. Eva doesn't reveal the truth about her father's illness or that she is in fact the true designer of the hotel. Phillip agrees to let her stay on as long as she promises to stay in constant contact with her father and that she doesn't use her real name, she agrees, she needs this job, her father is no longer competent, his memory is gone and Eva has been designing projects under his name for two years. Added to that is the fact he needs constant care and due to poor financial decisions, they are practically penniless. She cannot lose this job! They also agree to keep their relationship professional and forget about what they shared on the ship. Phillip suggests they consider themselves friends.

Eva is staying with her dear friend Lady Nora (heroine from the first book) and confesses all to her, Nora tells her she should tell Phillip the truth, but Eva wants time to prove herself. But that is going to be difficult, it seems that everyone is against her running the project. Union reps threaten Phillip, the General Contractor causes problems with her and demands that Phillip keeps her off the site, which causes problem with his relationship with Eva.

Phillip has other problems besides Eva, his mother is pushing Miss. Rebecca Hall in his path, he has told his mother repeatedly that he doesn't want to marry. Becca is a lovely woman, but he feels nothing for her besides friendship. He knows Becca doesn't want him either, but when he learns why, he agrees to ""court"" her to keep their parents at bay.

When Eva meets with the city building inspector and irons out the problems that have shut down the project. Phillip invites her out to celebrate, he wants an affair, but the risk is too high for her. He asks her to consider it. He takes her to see the new Madison Square Garden building and she is awed. She is touched that Phillip knows her so well and decides to take the risk and they embark on a heated affair.

Things are moving along, both personally and professionally for them, but Eva feels guilty about her lies, she decides to tell Phillip everything, but before she can, everything falls apart.

With her life in shambles, Eva flees to Newport and gets advice and support from an unexpected source. She returns to New York, intent on righting her wrongs.

Phillip will have to face some hard truths and make some serious decisions, is he willing to swallow his pride and grovel? Will that be enough to save his hotel and win back the woman he loves?

This book was fantastic, I couldn't put it down once I started reading, there is a lot going on, but it never feels busy and the story stays on track even with all the little side plots and twists and turns. It is well written, flows perfectly, has steamy love scenes, a little angst, betrayal, some heartache, lies, secrets, drama, witty banter, great secondary characters, a great epilogue and a very, very hard won HEA.

This is the second book in the series, but it can easily be read as a stand alone title. I cannot recommend this book enough, it is definitely going on my re-read list!

After tackling the French Impressionists, the Grim Reaper and Shakespeare, he showed this dame a good time in this super-fun romp through San Francisco in 1947. Using all the typical clichs in an original way, this book tells the story of Sammy, a bartender, who falls for a femme not so fatale named Stilton (like the cheese). There are goons, snakes and aliens. Moore really knows how to recreate the language and feel of the Sam Spade canon. Some chapters are told by Sammy and others by an omniscient narrator that, when I realized who it was, made me fall on the floor laughing. Johnny Heller gives a great performance on the Audiobook.

So, with not wanting to give either opportunity up, she decides to tackle both at the same time, knowing it will be a lot of hard work and long hours ahead for her, but it's not anything she can't handle. With her already full plate she then meets a man who awakens something in her she never knew was there, and before long the sparks are flying, but she makes it known to him that she can't offer him anything more than a fling. She is only at Oxford for a short time, and plans to head to D.C. once she is stateside, a commitment just isn't in the cards for her right now. But the more time she spends with Jamie the more she begins to realize, he is a once in a lifetime kind of guy, and what they share is far more than the fling she intended to carry on, but staying with him would mean giving up her dream...

My Oxford Year is delightful tale riddled with adventure, love, humor and inspiration!

I must say that Ms. Whelan is quite the gifted storyteller, rarely do you come across a read that makes you feel like you are an integral part of the story, when Ms. Durran hurt, I felt it, and when she laughed I was right there giggling along with her too!

8562,801,1505,"I was drawn to this book because of the premise of the main character being in a coma, the secrets, lies that ensue and the unreliable narrator aspect.  People are buzzing about this book, so I added it to my stack.

This is a dark read that has outrageous twists -- slap you in the face, make you wonder if you read it right, kind of twists. But the story in between the twists is a little lackluster, has a choppy feel from jumping back and forth in time (as well as the inclusion of diary entries) and I didn't connect with any characters. They are an unlikable bunch.

I understand why this book is so hyped and talked about. It gets most of its marks from me for the twists (especially the initial twist which I had to stop and wrap my head around). The premise is unique and the twists are supersized but I felt the rest of the story was weakly executed with the ending feeling overly ambiguous. It left me feeling irritated and unsatisfied with more questions than answers ... but not interested enough to spend more time figuring things out.

The story of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton wasn't familiar to me, and I quickly became immersed in Eliza's world. From a general's privileged daughter to the wife of a troubled but ambitious man, Eliza withstood many challenges. Yet she found her way through political intrigue, financial woes, personal tragedies, and enemies in high places to fiercely defend and carry on her husband's legacy.

8565,2,1901,"The day I picked up this book, police in California announced that they had finally made an arrest in the cold case of serial rape and murder described within its pages. I've put off learning more about that suspect until finishing the book and writing this review, but I understand that the author, the late independent crime journalist Michelle McNamara, is considered to be highly instrumental in publicizing this forgotten case and uncovering new evidence that helped lead to the perpetrator's long-overdue capture.

McNamara is central in this narrative, a manuscript that was completed from her notes following the author's untimely death in 2016. True crime can be a difficult genre to write, but she and her editors synthesize their sprawling subject matter with skill, bringing great humanity as they situate readers right in the midst of the communities that the killer preyed upon in the 1970s and 80s. It's shiver-inducing without ever becoming lurid, and McNamara makes plain why she found the obscure story captivating over two decades after the last known attack.

In addition to the terrifying crimes that the author documents, we also get a strong sense of her as a researcher, growing consumed by the mystery and convinced that a solution might lie in some old case file gathering dust. Just as readers can see a tantalizing shadow of the book McNamara intended to write, we can see how the identity of the criminal beckoned to her, keeping the author up at night with the conviction that he was just out of sight and some key clue away. This portrait of obsession is equal parts insightful and haunting, a poignant reminder that McNamara ultimately passed before getting to see her elusive adversary brought to justice.

The new developments in the Golden State Killer case will likely merit a new edition of this book with an updated afterword, but the present version already ends on a hopeful note that the investigation is closing in on its quarry. McNamara died believing that her quest for a killer was near its end, and her documentation of that quest would be an instant classic even if time hadn't proven her right after all.",1524700800,5

This is a story about a woman who has suppressed a very real, very painful trauma and her coming to terms with that after she reluctantly forms friendships with two fellow misfits. Eleanor is interesting but the writing works too hard to maintain the mystery surrounding Eleanor's past and her mother. Eleanor's lack of a computer struck me as particularly bizarre and felt like a holdout from when Honeyman was first writing the novel rather than something that would be realistically possible for Eleanor as a character.

Instead, you get a look at slavery, the experiences of running away and being caught, and all of the fear, anger, and agony that goes with it from the point of view of the slaves. The main character, Cora, is an incredibly strong character who never forgets who she is and isn't afraid to keep fighting for her freedom, no matter what it costs her along the way. If you're a fan of historical fiction, especially the kind that isn't just a bunch of boring dates and wars, then you should definitely check out this book.",1524787200,5
8570,596,1980,"Honestly, this was fantastic!  I just really loved everything about this delightful story.  I know Julia Whelan from her work as a narrator so I was really curious about this book as soon as I saw it.  I decided to give it a try simply because of my curiosity and didn't really know much about the book beyond my guess that it would be about someone spending a year at Oxford (nothing gets past me).  This book is really so much more than that and I must say that I had such a good time reading this book.

Ella is at the center of this story.  Ella is from Ohio and has just made it to England to study at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship.  To make things even better, she gets a call offering her a position to work on a presidential campaign just as she makes it to England.  Things are looking up for Ella.  She soon realizes that things are a little different at Oxford than she expects but she is making friends.  One of her classes is being taught by the same man she had a run-in with at the fish shop on her first day in town.  I do think that this a book that will really be best to go in as blindly as possible so I am going to be careful not to include any spoilers in this reviews.

I really liked Ella.  She is so driven to do well with everything she attempts but it quickly becomes obvious that she will have to make a few adjustments to succeed at Oxford.  She was just such a strong character and I found her very easy to relate to.  I really liked her more and more as the book progressed and thought that she grew dramatically as a character.  Jamie was also great.  He was more of a mystery to me at the start of the book but as I continued reading, I really fell in love with him.  He was such a great guy and I thought he compliments Ella very well.

This story made me think, it made me feel, and it even made me laugh.  This book was such a joy to read.  When I started reading, I thought that this was going to be one kind of story and then things changed and by the end of the book I was reading something totally different.  I loved the fact that this book went in such an unexpected direction kind of like life tends to do.

I would highly recommend this book to others.  Julia Whelan has proven that she is not only great narrator but that she is also a wonderful writer.  I am so glad that I had the opportunity to read this story and can't wait to read more of her work in the future.

I received a digital review copy of this book from William Morrow Paperbacks via Edelweiss.",1524787200,5
8571,440,1964,"I loved this alternate history zombie story! I thought that Ireland did a fantastic job of reimagining the post-Civil War US if the war had ended not because of a clear win by the Union but because humanity had to focus on surviving against a common foezombies. Ireland makes us truly think about the treatment of blacks in the US at that time (and even today). Sure, the slaves had been freed, but we see how they are still treated as somehow sub-human and used for the benefit of white people. The exploration of how many religious leaders viewed blacks is especially sad.

Of course, all of this is explored against a backdrop of a fight against zombies. There were times when the book felt a little long and slightly slow to meslower than I would expect for a book about the zombie apocalypse. There actually isn't a lot of zombie-fighting action in the story and the conspiracy aspect of the story didn't always hold my attention. But the overall themes are so timely and important that I found myself wanting to keep reading even when the story slowed down. And I loved Jane, so I was rooting for her all the way. In the end, I gave this one 4/5 stars.

8572,1010,1901,"The writing lacks a chronological focus, but still manages to convey the chronological changes in M.O. of the perpetrator.  This is an insight missing from other true crime books. Its good he has been captured. Its a shame the statutes of limitations have run on hundreds of the crimes he committed so that he will only be held to answer for the murders.",1524873600,4

8574,608,819,"Im not going to rehash this novel as it seems everyone and their brother has read it.  If you haven't and you like mysteries and suspense novels, I highly suggest you pick this novel up.  I found, as I read the first third of this novel, I got to know the character of Anna quite well but it wasn't until after this point that I finally understood what the hype about this book was all about.  It was during the second part of this novel that I became mesmerized by this novel and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

I was fascinated by Anna as she viewed the world from her computer and her camera lens.  Once a talented psychologist, Annas physical world has become limited to the four-outside walls that make up her home.  An anxiety disorder has taken control of her life.  I loved how she tried to help individuals over the internet, her professional side still shining through yet she hid her true identity.  Intrigued by the individuals around her street, Anne views their world through her camera lens.  With precision, she can get close and personal with her lens yet remain anonymous as she tries to become part of their world. She becomes creepy in my world, when she secretly runs computer searches on these neighbors and begins creating alternate scenarios where she is actually a part of their lives without anyone even knowing.

Lots of questions ran through my mind as I read this novel and as I read, my questions were answered and then some. The character of Anna was captivating and her means for living with her condition, lead to an interesting life.  She hid behind her computer screen and her camera lens and she would be fine if she could stay hidden.  Would it really matter if someone discovered Annas safe haven?  What happens at the end of this novel, was fantastic.  I figured that the ending would be astounding and it definitely delivered that.",1524960000,5
8575,692,1981,"I have to admit that I only read Page 1 to 22, and the last 4 chapters. Having done that, I can say that the book seems to be well-written and interesting...but perhaps not the ""breathtaking, page-turning, masterpiece"" stated by a reviewer. I personally feel that the results of the 2016 election can be summed-up with a video of Hillary calling half of Trump's supporters ""deplorables"". The other would be the election night TV broadcasts from the so called ""news"" media as they sunk to increasing levels of despair. I was proud to have a ""Deplorable for Trump"" bumper sticker on my Chevy. I commend Ms Chozick for being a ""sport"", and not whining ""we really did win"".",1525046400,3
