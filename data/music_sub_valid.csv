8130,456,3215,The longer songs are definitely superior to the shorter ones. The short ones acted as filler to put out a full album when really this is an EP worth of songs at best. Now the longer songs are actually pretty solid and enjoyable. Not very unique sound wise but still worth listening to. I can see why people bought the deluxe version over the normal release. There just isn't enough substance here to justify calling it a full album.,1503792000,3

8197,2305,1138,"I notice that every time they release multiple soundtrack albums of something--like one for each Bond film, for each ""Star Wars"" film--they always make sure the ""official theme"" is on each. Which is cool--most people aren't ""completists"" with movie soundtracks and only buy the one they like best or the only one they saw. But in my case, I bought this ""both seasons"" set rather than each season individually. And a less-spooky version of ""Edelweiss"" has always been on my ""Sound Of Music"" soundtrack. I hear there's going to be a third season--what'll they do when it comes to a soundtrack album for that one? There's a companion album with a lot of the music the characters heard in clubs, on jukeboxes, over the radio and so on in the course of the series. I passed on that because the Japanese version of ""End Of the World"" wasn't on it--only one in English, similar to Skeeter Davis' original version. Maybe the Japanese one should have been included here. As for this album, though, I'm glad I wasn't paying enough attention when I watched the series to catch what music goes with American SS officer John Smith's shoving a fellow officer who posed a threat to him off the headquarters building in New York.",1503964800,4

India's voice is like a instrument that was made to lull you into a state of peace within your mind and soul.  Her tracks were created to be the vessel to carry to your heart.  She is a wunderkind of all that is out of proportion in your life and sent to build it back up.  In this industry of half-naked vocalist who use sex to sell their weapons, India is a weapon herself, sent to guide your soul to the earthy regions of the universe and transform you into something filled with tranquility and peace.

8286,2331,2825,"I'm a long time Joni fan and this album will offers a lot me and other long devotees for a glimpse of the very early Joni playing live in front of a small audience: her and her guitar. Hearing how the introduces songs and interacts with the crowd and plays around is a bit like being a time traveler.

Like so many ""early"" albums the recording quality is pretty rough, but Joni still comes through for me and it's more like proof of its early origins. The quality doesn't matter to me. In some ways this is like any prequel: early Steppenwolf, Fleetwood Mac, Johnny Winter and so forth. This album shows the early Joni Mitchell who later became the influential artist I grew up with and influenced me so much.

This a bookend at the start of her long career and musical journey and was missing from my collection. It provides an anchor on her musical journey. But enough philosophy/navel gazing! It's just a darn good listen for any Joni lover.

The bottom line for me is this recording brings me into an intimate performance with one of my favorite artists. I get a sense of being in the audience back in 66 in a way that Miles of Aisles and Shadows and Light  don't do even with their clear technical superiority. To me this album isn't about the recording quality or technical details; it's just about Joni playing to a small crowd and having fun on her way to become one of the great musicians of her generation. Obviously I think this is 5 stars! It has technical issues but to me they are like proof of authenticity and don't detract.",1504224000,5

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more. The CD comes with liner notes written by Garfunkel about Simons songs. I enjoy these little peaks behind the curtains.",1505260800,3

8620,2095,422,"In my continuing quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Big-Box-Bach-Orchestral-Music/dp/B00KS0ASOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Big Box :: Bach Orchestral Music</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Handel-Oratorio-Box/dp/B00KICWEN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Handel Oratorio Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Big Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the first of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bigger-Beethoven-Box/dp/B01BHELQD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bigger Beethoven Box</a>, which I have previously reviewed), and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including piano sonatas, cello sonatas, string quartets, three of his nine symphonies, incidental music for The Creatures of Prometheus and Egmont, as well as piano variations, minuets, sonatinas, overtures, rondos, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Big Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I do have two minor reservations about it:

1. There are no piano trios on ""Big Beethoven Box."" Some of my favorite Beethoven chamber music masterpieces  especially his Archduke and Ghost trios  belong to this sub-genre, and I think the fact that none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.

2. The albums engineering does not quite rise to the level of the best Big Box albums  especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.  There are also a few technical glitches to the album that require manual editing of individual tracks metadata. (See reviewer Upstate Listeners excellent review for tips on how to fix these problems.)

Despite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience. Highly recommended.  (4 Stars ^ 5)",1505347200,5

And I'm unfamiliar with The Script as a band, or with the work of will.i.am beyond the ""Samurai Jack"" theme song (yes, I'm a cartoon buff...).  But a family member introduced me to this song, a collaboration by both bands... and I found it to be an amazing song.  Not just for having a catchy beat and lyrics that are actually intelligible and (fairly) clean, but for having an incredibly inspiring message as well.  It's not just a good song, but a powerful anthem toward being the best you can be and following your dreams.  And while that may seem like a saccharine message in our day and age, it's still a meaningful one, and one we need to remember.

This song makes me want to check out more of The Script's work... and perhaps give more of the work of will.i.am a shot.  I may not be a rap fan, but if there are songs like this out there, maybe I'll dip a toe into the genre a little more...",1505520000,5

""I got a feeling that I can't let go."" by ""Caught A Ghost""

Five HIP Stars! The Amazon Originals TV show ""Bosch"" stars Titus Welliver as the hardboiled, jazz-loving, world weary LAPD detective, Harry Bosch, and the show is supported by an outstanding cast. The main theme is well known to ""Bosch"" fans for both the mirrored upside down visuals in the show's title credits and it's laid back, infectious, and swinging theme music ""Can't Let Go"" by LA singer, songwriter, producer, and DJ Jesse Nolan, performing under the group name ""Caught A Ghost"". The haunting song swings hard with jazzy violins, driving drums and bass, Nolan's unusual lyrics and delivery, and the muted hip trumpet playing the theme. Bosch fans can finally hear the entire track from the album ""Human Nature"". Highly Recommended. Five INTENSE Stars! (Label: +1 Records. 1-MP3 track, streamed from Amazon Prime Music.

8664,777,2401,"Caught this at the end of some movie...thought, wow, that's a very rocked out cover of a good song.  Don't have any Godsmack in my collection but often times I discover new music due to a cover (Big Sugar's cover of Dear Mr. Fantasy, Lenny Kravitz cover of American Woman, and how about the cover of While my Guitar Gently Weeps by Regina Spektor?  Awesome cover).

When I went to grab this cut I discovered Godsmack also covered Rocky Mountain Way and Time (Joe Walsh and Pink Floyd).  Grabbed all 3, like all three a lot.  RMW and Time were both pretty good rock songs when released.  Godsmack is pretty faithful to the original cuts but give both songs some very good attitude adjustments - really nice guitar work, very nicely done Godsmack.

Come Together was a fairly typical Beatles song, soft rock maybe?  Hard to classify Beatles songs (I guess that's why they are so loved).  Godsmack rocks this song and gives it a whole new sound.  And yet, they still somehow remain faithful to the original song, the original sound.

I'm a fan - their versions of these three songs show great respect for The Beatles, Walsh and Floyd - but still give us something fresh and...fresh and Godsmacked!",1505606400,5

8751,2445,672,"Like all Bach Guild 'Big Box' collections, this is a terrific value - in this case, 14 hours and 6 minutes (according to my iTunes tracklist) and 184 tracks of music, 14 of Haydn's symphonies plus a good selection of his other works - string quartets, masses, divertimento. Haydn wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Haydn for the first time.

The point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.

I value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.

Then, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.

Regardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to. I've had this particular Bach Guild set since purchasing it in 2013, in fact, and it's about time I posted a review here to express my opinion on the worthiness of this set!",1506124800,5

8854,867,2536,"Not being a huge Depeche Mode fan but loving quite a few of their songs, VIOLATOR is the one album I loved and I will probably completely download the digital version of the album as well as other Depeche Mode tracks from various original vinyl albums.  I have never cared for the singles so much as the album versions of their songs, so this is the best way to do that.  Yes I had quite a few LP's from DM but for the most part I ended up recording audio cassettes of my favorite tracks in the order I liked them, save the Violator album.  Amazon makes doing this easy and the quality of these digital tracks are perfection.  Usually album-oriented, this is somewhat against my usual grain, but in the cases such as this, where a handful of songs will suffice, you can't argue with the price!",1506470400,5

8859,867,3273,"If, like me, you owned the original Crimson & Clover LP you were one of the few to have the original long play version of the title track.  It plumb eluded me for decades, having the single version on various artist records and CD's and recently replacing my few vinyl albums with the ESSENTIALS collection from Rhino, very well remastered.  But I still missed the long album version and finally, easy as pie!  Download the version digitally and you have a remastered terrific sounding copy to take you back to 1968!  Now I'm considering buying the rest of the album just for nostalgia, you can burn your own CD this way (I've done it with quite a few hard to find items now and Amazon gets total kudos from me in that department).  This song and this version is a national treasure of the psychedelic 60's and if you are only familiar with the single version from radio days, try this out, it's a buck and a quarter well spent.  The relaxing almost Hawaiian guitar instrumentals that caress you up to the wah-wah'd processed vocals at the end are a beautiful side trip from the cut and edited single version.",1506470400,5

Great for fans of music of this decade, and it makes me curious about the film itself...",1506470400,4

8969,867,1405,"I don't think there has been a more definitive example of ""fusion"" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire.  Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.

So this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about ""smooth jazz"" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!

The CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.  Get a heaping helping right here and you won't regret it.",1506902400,5
8970,867,1405,"I don't think there has been a more definitive example of ""fusion"" in music history as with Earth Wind & Fire.  Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.

I remember when it first came out I LOVED it. But now I'm sick of it. Anytime it comes on the radio I want to turn it. If I'm able to, I probably will. Just not a fan of this song anymore. It's crappy music now.

9012,1744,3357,"I'm a pretty huge Sheryl Crow fan. Her early music (first 3 or 4 albums) still hold a special place in my heart. I like her voice and think she's a gifted lyricist. This song, although old, is still good and holds up without being too annoying even though it was a huge hit in the 90s. I just saw the video on MTV Classic and I just love her. She's so pretty in the video for this song. Natural beauty and talent. Like Mariah Carey (although I'm an even bigger fan of Mariah's). I wish Sheryl continued to make good music but these days I don't think that's really happening anymore although she had a new album earlier in April.

I miss her songs and wish dearly the quality of her tunes didn't peeter off. Sheryl is gold! One of my top 25 favorite artists probably. And that's saying something!

9022,2501,3359,"Songwriting of the highest order, ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" is the greatest hit to never be a hit. A poignant comment on disillusionment with the supposed sophistication of big city life. Not that it's never been said before, but never better than this. As popular as the song has become with the passage of time, it's surprising it hasn't made its way onto any of John's many best-of compilations.",1507161600,5

9104,2514,3024,"I think it's unfair as well as poor marketing by Amazon, that simply because it's available by purchasing the ""album only,"" that they don't even let you listen to samples. I do not believe this was the usual practice before ""Amazon Music"" came along. I'll bet good money that I can still sample the album on iTunes. You people need to pull your heads out of your collective asses as far as you are handling mp3 music. You're going to lose customers before all is said and done. There are plenty of other sites we can download our music from. Contrary to your beliefs--you have not cornered the market on downloadable digital music. Bad enough you still have a music application that hasn't worked properly since you ever updated the so-called music ap. Look at your own forums if you don't believe me.",1507507200,1

9115,1639,104,"This is one of those songs you listen to and it's really up to the listener to form an opinion about what the song is really trying to say :) Since this song was written around the psychedelic era during the '60s, I'm sure some sort of hallucinogenic, dream-like experience comes to mind :) I was reading the lyrics to this song while writing this, so it's more spiritual and religious teaching using the hustle and bustle of New York City life than drug related. I like Simon & Garfunkel and saw the video on You Tube with over 1 million likes, so I thought I would add this song to my collection. This is another great song with lyrics that are on a different level than your average singer-songwriter.",1507507200,5

9147,2125,2995,"Some of the most haunting movie music I have ever heard. I love it. I was slightly surprised while listening to some Irish music recently that a couple songs in the soundtrack sound similar to Irish songs. Listen to ""The Swallow Tail Jig"" in Digital music and ""This Kiss"" here and see if you think so too. The talent in making the music enhance the cinematography and action scenes is a unique talent that few composers achieve with such emotion and grandeur. This is one of the best music soundtracks I have ever heard in over sixty years of watching movies with some of the greatest composers of all time.",1507680000,5

9166,52,880,"Marilyn Manson was the king of shock rock in the 90s and was always very consistent with his music. However after Holywood came out his albums became very hit or miss and dare I say boring. That changes with ""The Pale Emperor"" and he goes back to doing what he does best, making awesome music, that's extremely catchy. This album is a different beast from what has been released in the past, mainly due to the inclusion of more Blues Rock influences. It works really well and the entire album is easy to listen to from start to finish. Highlights for me include: ""Killing Strangers"", ""Deep Six"" and the great track ""Odds of Even"".",1507852800,5

ZZ Ward has become one of my favorite recent artists! Looking forward to being able to purchase her newest album, as well! Not totally sure why it''s got the ""Explicit"" attached.

Won't cause one to pause while in a conversation, but has a decent party tempo as long as it isn't used for center stage entertainment.

Seems that they are trying hard to be all of them.  For my tastes, I much prefer their country songs.  They do some nice light rock songs too and ""Kiss Goodbye""  flops back and forth between country and rock.  ""Shut Up Train"" is a nice country song and I wish they did more songs of this nature.  ""Why Oh Why"" is a good Southern Rock song that will get your juices flowing.",1508544000,4

While ""(I've Had) The Time Of My Life"" would have to be the most famous song from said soundtrack, ""Hungry Eyes"" is another beautiful and memorable number -- Eric Carmen has a great voice, and he clearly gives his all to this song.

I've enjoyed other albums by Teddy Thompson in the past, but this could be the best thing he's done yet. These two singers are a perfect musical fit.

But darn it, why couldn't they have given us an extra song or two? This is much too short. I still shudder at the thought of spending so much money for only 25 minutes of music. That makes this more an EP than a proper album. I shouldn't complain too loudly; the songs here are truly first-rate, but it's not exactly value for the money. Is there a reason that it's not being sold at a much cheaper price?",1508630400,4

9289,292,2262,"I have been a die hard Beatles fan forever. There isn't too many things I can remember when I was 7 years old but I still remember watching The Ed Sullivan Show way back one Sunday night in February of 1964 when the Beatles appeared causing a sensation bringing Beatlemania from England across the Atlantic to the U.S. Their music was like nothing ever heard before and would influence songwriters and musicians to this day.

Their songbook seems to be endless from all the great hits they had during their time together. To try to list all their greatest songs would take too much time and space for this review. For me though even more time consuming would be trying to pick which is my favorite song by the Fab Four. Just too many outstanding tunes to choose from. Most times you could say my favorite Beatles song is whichever one of theirs I happen to be listening to at that moment. If on the other hand you were to ask me to come up with a top ten list of the Beatles best songs there is one song in particular that would in my book make it somewhere on that list, the song is ""Rain"". A really great Beatles song that is while a great one is little known and overlooked by many fans.

One reason is it never charted. It also never appeared on any of the Beatles albums. In fact it was released in 1966 as the B side to the Beatles hit single ""Paperback Writer"". This is however I feel a song that deserved to be the A side on any single. It has everything a great song needs insightful lyrics, great beat, great guitar work that combined grabs your attention.  This was recorded at the time the Beatles were transitioning their sound from the mop top ""She loves you yeah yeah yeah"" kind of music to being more experimental with their sound and creative with their words. For the true Beatles fanatic this is certainly one of their songs that has to be considered for download onto your iPod or smart phone.",1508716800,5

9327,1782,2242,"Fans are so fickle because they expect the super hit, but this record has good songs throughout (no bad ones).  They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.  Highly recommended for anyone who is coming to the 3 Doors the first time.",1508889600,5

9453,2596,3431,"Cheap Xmas is a cleverly titled set that combines all of Fagan's previous solo albums and the bonus disc from the ""Nightfly Trilogy"" boxed set a from a decade ago. The mastering here is exactly the same as that previous set plus it has Fagan's fourth solo album. The main attraction is going to be disc five here with the b-sides, soundtrack songs, demos and live tracks.

Since the old of print ""Nightfly Trilogy"" is so expensive, this is the best way to get the bonus disc for a reasonable price. It would have been nice to see these remastered with high re discs but what we get here is a pretty good set. Unlike most of these reasonable boxed sets, this has the booklets for the first three albums included along with the cardboard holders for each. ""Sunken Condos"" includes the gatefold cardboard sleeve with the booklet. It's a nice boxed set (it sounds as if none of these have been re-mastered) and even the face of the CD looks the same as the garden variety individual releases.",1509494400,4

9566,2596,2950,"I'm going to miss Tom Petty. His melodic, honest, direct and intelligent brand of rock music seems to be fading away. These series of concerts recorded from the early 80's through 2008, are an excellent document of a working band. Petty and The Heartbreakers are all in top form here.

I was at one of the shows that was included here (it was Tom Petty's week long residency at the Fillmore) and the atmosphere can positively be felt as the band's music rumbles throughout the speakers. The CDs are housed in cardboard sleeves with the songs listed on the back. All of these come in a nicely designed cardboard box and includes a booklet with comments from the late Petty about the concerts.

This is a nice summary of the band's live performances similar to Springsteen's boxed set released back in 1984 but, for me, this works so much better (and it is less expensive as well continuing to show Petty's commitment to not ripping off his fans).",1510099200,5

9608,874,2176,"Without realizing it I've collected several favorites among Sheryl Crow's songs -- ""All I Wanna Do,"" ""Everyday Is a Winding Road,"" her theme song for ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" and ""Real Gone"" (from the soundtrack of Pixar's ""Cars"").  Of them all, however, I'd say ""Soak Up the Sun"" is my favorite.  It's a lighthearted song with an upbeat and perky guitar line throughout and playful lyrics, and evokes the feeling of summer, the beach, and just good times in general.  And during these cold and murky November days, it's the perfect antidote to the oncoming winter blues.",1510358400,5

9626,2305,965,"It consisted of one verse and one chorus. The other 14 minutes were a jam featuring an organ solo by Doug Ingle, a guitar solo by Erik Brann and a drum solo by Ron Bushy. Bassist Lee Dorman got half a duet with Ingle, but Bushy proved with his drum solo that you can get away with repeating ""Shave and a Haircut, Six Bits"" for a long time. As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"". So when Atco edited out everything but the vocal section, you got three reps each of the verse and refrain. So it didn't make much of a single. Be warned--you're better off with the album.",1510444800,2

9662,2095,3470,"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 1 is the first of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including: Antonin Dvorak, Anton Bruckner, Franz Schubert, Alexander Borodin, and Johannes Brahms.

Although I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorite is Cypresses, a twelve-movement chamber work by Dvorak thats performed to perfection by The Cleveland Quartet. I also find the Violin Sonata in A Major and Piano Quintet in A Major by Schubert to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 1 is excellent. This album is a winner in every way, and at only 99 cents, its an unbeatable bargain that belongs in the digital music library of anyone who appreciates classical chamber music Highly recommended.",1510531200,5

This song was played a lot on the TV series Saturday Night Love years ago when Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan played on that show for years, and this was a long time ago starting in 1998. Those two comics played as brothers who would go to a nightclub and try to pick up girls and they wanted to dance with them. Of course they didn't know how to dance and it was really funny. But I loved this song the first time I heard it. A movie was made also ""A Night At The Roxbury"" was the nightclub place that played this song; and Will Ferrell and Kris Kattan starred in the movie playing as brothers and they would go to the nightclub every weekend.

Turns out that the tracks played at this gig are from the Igster's 'Lust For Life' ('77), 'The Idiot' ('77) and obviously his most recent work 'Post Pop Depression' ('16). Tunes I got the most out of were the previously mentioned ass-kicking ""Lust For Life"", ""Sister Midnight"", ""Funtime"", the awesome ""Nightclubbing"", the very recognizable ""The Passenger"" and ""China Girl"". Not to mention some material off the newest CD - like ""Gardeia"", ""Chocolate Drops"" and ""Paraguay"". Only downside here - maybe for some - is that I didn't see any Stooges classics covered. That's okay - it's all good just the same. The DVD has the very same track listing as the two audio CD's. Highly recommended.",1510704000,5

9724,1878,2325,"Many people thought that Bob Dylan's album Christmas in the Heart must have been some kind of sick holiday joke back in 2009, but I think it has held up well in the years since. This is one of the more offbeat, but finest holiday albums released in the past 20 to 25 years. And as the years (and Christmases) go by, it seems more and more that this is the Christmas seed from which all of Dylan's recent ""great American songbook"" albums have sprung from. This album was meant to echo the classic, old-time Xmas songs of way back when. Like Sinatra, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Burl Ives and company. The arrangements and production values reflect that. Yes, Bob's voice is ragged, creakly, sandpapery and rough, but you get a feeling that he puts new life into these songs which can seem tired at best in the hands of another singer. And you feel that he truly believes the sentiments expressed in these songs, something very rare in today's Xmas albums. Another trick of the trade that Bob (and perhaps everybody) knows: just like the late great Leonard Cohen, Bob uses sweet female voices to be the sugar on his sometimes hard to get vocals. The backup singers here remind me of the Andrews Sisters. The point is that this album works.
  Highlights include Here Comes Santa Claus, I'll Be Home for Christmas, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song and more. I'd never heard the song Christmas Island before, but now I have to rank it among my favorite Xmas songs. It's cute and kitschy. This album is recommended for Dylan fans, Xmas album nuts, and those who grow a bit tired of the holiday fare on Lite FM. It's also a wonderful primer for those who wish to get into (or try to appreciate) Dylan's more recent standards albums, Shadows in the Night, Fallen Angels and Triplicate. All in all a nice recommendation. Happy (very early) Holidays!------------------------------PEACE

It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including (among others): Ernst von Dohn&aacute;nyi, Claude Debussy, Darius Milhaud, Alban Berg, Maurice Ravel, and Charles Gounod.

Although I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S.

I think my favorites are Milhauds Petite Symphony No. 3 as performed by the Sinfonia Orchestra with Barry Faldner, and Dohn&aacute;nyis Piano Quintet No. 1 in C minor by The Cleveland Quartet with Barry Snyder. I also find the Debussys Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp to be especially enjoyable.

9749,549,2151,"It is always sad whenever someone young and talented dies at a early age. For this, it was a deviating shocker. Hearing about the tragic death of Malcolm Young, one of the musical virtuosos of AC/DC, was just a devastating shock. Hard to believe he passed away after leaving the group 3 years ago, and privately battling with dementia that crippled him. Now with his death, he joins his musical brother Bon Scott, who died over 35 years ago, after he had long-fronted the group. But with Brian Johnson taking the helm, AC/DC hit their commercial peak with Back In Black. Through that album, AC/DC had a lot of great songs through that album. But nevertheless, the group had a lot of wonderful anthems, and You Shook Me All Night Long remains one of AC/DC's finest. The song is a real feel-good boogie rhythm that still ignites today from the heart and soul of the music. Whenever I hear this year, I think of all the joy AC/Dc brought to a mass appeal that no rock group had ever been able to do before. Now, with Malcolm Young passing on, his legacy is enshrined with some of guitar's greatest heroes like Jimi Hendrix and Chicago's Terry Kath and B.B. King. May Malcolm Young be forever remembered, shaking us all night long.

9830,1505,3500,"I pulled this CD out of my shelf the other day and the songs were just as good as I remembered from when I purchased this back in 2010. Songs such as ""Do you Love Me"", better than the Contours version and the best version I've heard, ""Glad All Over"", ""Bits and Pieces"", ""Can't you See That She's Mine"", both songs titled ""Everybody Knows"", ""Catch Us If you Can"", ""I Like It Like That"", ""Because"" and the previously unreleased ""Universal Love"", which has the same corde progression as Marmalade's ""Reflections Of My Life"". Also loved the lowd haunting ""Ninteen Days"", a nice blues rock song about being lonely. ""Everybody Knows (We're Through"" was covered by Engelbert Humperdinck and both versions are great. Sadly I got rid of the imbossed outer box to this package. I happily have the 28 page booklet included, but I am not fond of the liner notes here because it makes Dave Clark sound very selfish. It only mentions stuff about him and no other band members. I was expecting that to happen as he is a really greedy selfish man who always resists the chance to keep his albums available on CD. When he passes away, there is a better chance of more CD reissues as the masters will be lisenced to his family and maybe we'll see them on CD in the future. I don't really want to say this, but hurry up, Dave and die! so your fantastic music becomes available forever on CD.",1511654400,5

9959,1197,2697,"Five MARVELOUS Stars. From the album The Best of Spanky & Our Gang, 20th Century Masters, The Millennium Collection, this is the short-lived, so-called sunshine pop vocal and instrumental group, Spanky & Our Gang performing their lovely, swinging performance of their classic hit song, Like To Get To Know You that continues to get lots of airplay by the oldies but goodies radio stations. The group was led by Elaine Spanky McFarlane whose sultry, attractive, distinctive voice gave the group its unique vocal sound. The Our Gang septet members were: Malcolm Hale, Nigel Pickering, Paul Oz Bach, John Seiter, Kenny Hodges, and Lefty Baker, all on vocals, plus Max Bennett on bass, Larry Knechtel on piano, Mike Deasy on guitar, and Hal Blaine on drums, and an 11 piece string section. Unfortunately, arranger/guitarist Malcolm Hale died in an accident and the group chose to not go on without him in 1969. But their marvelous music, which transcends musical genres, has been re-packaged several time in re-issues and is thankfully available in the digital MP3 era. This one song alone shows they were already talented artists who could mix genres in creating highly-attractive vocal and instrumentally rhythmic music

The song Like To Get To Know You was written by producer Stuart Scharf and is about the search for love. Arranger Hale creates a marvelous shifting musical setting combining rock, latin, jazz, and classical musical devices. It is actually built on a subtle latin beat and uses an advanced musical pedal point that can be repeated endlessly if desired: a form that jazz men Ahmad Jamal, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane used to great advantage as modal music. Legendary drummer Blaine, the most recorded drummer in recording history, whips up a subtle storm behind the group throughout the performance.

The song Like To Get To Know You is a favorite that is begins with an attractive buoyant drum beat, violins, and a comping piano over drum rimshots. The song is build on the infectious repetition of call-response lyrics like Id like to get to know you', (""yes I would""): ""Id like to get to know you"", (""if I could) and so on. The male members and Spanky trade lyrics until Spanky enters alone on the bridge with a sassy delivery which continues on with the main lyric and the refrain. Then suddenly comes a lovely, idyllic interlude with ethereal echoes, strings, and guitars which sets the stage for a pretty vocal coda that includes the male voices and Spankys voice in another call-response phase that vamps to the fadeout. Produced by Stuart Scharf. What a marvelous performance and a feat of studio engineering! My Highest Recommendation. Five APPEALING Stars. (Island Mercury records. 1-MP3 track. Time-3:18.)",1512259200,5

10002,15,1937,"Another superb album by Arcade Fire. ""The Suburbs"" won best album of the year at the Grammy's a few years ago and I 100% agree. I enjoy every song, even ""Rococo"" (strange lyrics but awesome music). Win Butler has a great voice, it's full of emotion and melody. How can you not feel something on tracks like: ""Modern Man"", ""We Used to Wait, ""Deep Blue,"", ""Ready to Start"", and the title track? The answer is, you can't. He has this special, rare quality to his music that you can't fake or manufacture. Beautiful album by a beautiful band. ""The Suburbs"" is a meaningful and unforgettable album. I listen to it all the time. And I don't care what people say, I also like their latest album, ""Everything Now"". I appreciate that the band are not afraid to change up their sound with each studio album. So with that being said, I recommend ALL 5 of their studio albums, but start with ""The Suburbs"" - it's their most groundbreaking. Enjoy!",1512432000,5

10018,907,924,This is another remix that makes me like the original song more. The dance beat is nothing special. A dance song should make you want to dance. This beat doesn't even move my head. Kind of a pointless remix.,1512518400,3

This song was recorded years ago but it seems to still hold true today. Merle Haggard was a true country singer and always sang songs that were true to heart. We will miss him and his music too.",1513296000,5

 I was looking for another song when I happened to come across this song by John Anderson. I haven't heard this song since I was a kid years ago. I used to listen to it all the time but never gave much thought to the song back then but now I listen to it and it tells a story about the Seminole Indians.",1513296000,5

10125,2644,3532,"As much as I love George Harrison, this is one of his worst albums.  He had damaged his vocals while touring and was being criticized for adding Krishna lyrics to his Beatles classics. His creative funk had also crept into the recording studio when making this album. ""Ding Dong,"" ""Simply Shady,"" and ""Dark Horse"" are his strongest tracks. Others may like ""Far East Man,"" which he co-wrote with Ron Wood. But Harrison's odd cover of the Everly Brothers ""Bye Bye Love"" is difficult to like. In fact, it sounds like a warped vinyl record playing on a cheap turntable. Overall, the album sounds like Harrison was trying to distance himself from his Beatles legacy but didn't quite know which direction to take it. Dark Horse isn't a terrible album. Harrison fans like myself own it...but would a Harrison fan recommend it to another person less familiar with his work? Probably not without a disclaimer.",1513296000,3

10130,32,406,One of the best songs ever!,1513382400,5
10131,599,2174,"This is more of a 4.25 star album (yes, I'm getting nit-picky here).  I love Two Steps from Hell, and Thomas Bergersen's previous album ""Illusions"" was magnificent (10 stars for that one).  This one sounded better in the 30-sec previews; I found it has a very tribal quality (due to the vocals) upon listening to the tracks all the way through.  It's in my writing playlist rotation, as I don't think it's a bad album...it's just not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it's grown on me the more I've listened to it - one of those cases of familiarity breeding enjoyment.  I don't regret my purchase; this is one I might have delayed, however, if I'd had the forethought to listen to it on YouTube.  While ""Illusions"" remains a masterful work with infinite replay value, ""Sun"" is more a mood thing and one I don't find myself reaching to play as often.",1513382400,4

10332,549,3073,"Hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the tragic death of Natalie Cole. Musically, she was one of the most soulful R&B songstresses in the world. Yet, in the way Natalie was remembered at the end, was actually by so many people remembering Natalie from the problems she had endeavored back in the 70's and early 80's, from bankruptcy and addiction. Sadly, that is disgusting to her legacy, and the everlasting memory of her beloved father, Nat King Cole. There are so many songs she had soulfully graced our hearts with for 40 years of pop music. Natalie Cole will always be remembered so many great songs, but her debut hit, Everlasting Love, will always be the one people will go to for the first glimpse. The song is just a joyous and soulful rhythm that still shows beauty and soul from the heart. today, the song has been the signature opus, for eHarmony. It is one my favorite songs that Natalie Cole will forever be remembered for, and a real treat for anyone who has never even heard a glimpse of her unforgettable voice.

This ""departure"" CODA struck all the right chords with me concerning the passing of a stellar mostly lately under-rated artist. More young people and typical modern"" country"" and/or ""rock and rollers"" need to check out Glen's history and learn from a master. The man was an innovator and a foundation stone of American popular music. I remember watching the Glenn Campbell hour back in the 60s-70s and he always had the coolest acts, so it brought our family together in front of the TV on those nights.  9 times out of 10 my mostly traditional country music DAD would give a nod of approval to what we were listening to, simply because Glen had them on his show, that was a HUGE stamp of approval. Let me just ask you, what music program of the modern era (right now) brings families together like this? This was way before MTV so we didn't suffer from lack of video of our favorite up and coming artists in those days, thanks to Glen's vision. NO he is not a relation to me (that I am aware of) but every CAMPBELL in this family is proud and always loved Glen and not just for his name. Glen Campbell made beautiful, inspiring and memorable moments, not just music!",1514851200,5

10366,2787,2352,"THE SHELTERS self-titled debut rocks!!!  Anybody remember what that means?!!  It's straight-up American rock.  No shouting of lyrics, a la Dave Grohl, Foo Fighters.  These songs are actual melodies with harmony, sung by a terrific band, who play, rather than ""wear"" guitars, drums, write their own music & sound both experienced yet entirely fresh & new....what a concept for music & music lovers to love!  And, you will LOVE everything about THE SHELTERS!!!  I, myself, discovered them on ""Last Call With Carson Daly"" - thank you, Carson, for still providing us with impressive new musical artists!!

I understand Tom Petty (R.I.P.) discovered these guys in L.A. & what better Stamp of Approval could anyone in music desire?!!  He lent them the use of his studio & left them to it to create & THE SHELTERS do not disappoint!!!  Certainly, there are influences heard & that's a good thing.  The beginning chords of 1st track & single ""REBEL HEART"" recall very early Beatles and the song also brings to (my) mind The Rembrandts Theme Song To (T.V. show) Friends, ""I'll Be There For You"", but more rock, less pop!  - Make no mistake, this is genuinely authentic ROCK!! The guitars on ""Never Look Behind Ya"" recall a more recent band, The Black Keys.  The opening chords on ""Liar"" are reminiscent of Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", but then takes off in its' own really rockin' direction!!  Biggest rocker on CD & my #1 favorite!!  Some songs, though relatively few, considering...have a faint whisper of Tom Petty (particularly Track #2 ""Birdwatching"" & Track #9, ""Gold""), but no influences heard here will hit you over the head; it's much more subtle - more like a light flavoring, rather than a dollop of gravy!!

All tracks Winners, no Fillers!  Additional noteworthy favorites including ""Birdwatching"" & ""Liar"" are all 4 opening tracks wherein Track #1 is the phenomenal ""Rebel Heart"" & Track #9 ""Fortune Teller!!  Anyone who's been lamenting the death of rock 'n roll should immediately buy this, support this band & ROCK!!",1514851200,5

10370,874,2608,"This song has become something of a meme in recent years (it seemed to be a popular one to spoof in Vine videos), but despite this it's still a lovely song.  Upbeat without being overly saccharine, it has a nice blend of piano accompaniment and wistful but still upbeat lyrics.  Vanessa Carlton's voice is a little raspy, but that helps give the song a little charm in my opinion.  A nice antidote to a lot of the overproduced, overly sugary pop songs of today.",1514851200,4

10476,320,3582,"Along with the Mass in b and the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio deserves to be one of Bach's best works. It demonstrates to me how intelligent he was musically in putting a piece (any piece of any genre) together, using particular instruments to add sensitivity and color. And so, 150 minutes go by with not one of boredom. Moreover, hardly any baroque composer can make you weep as Bach does.
I am writing this because, after reading other reviews (some of which, sorry, are so absurd as to deem them inappropriate -- check the one star with the comment!) I have to strongly disagree with the appreciation of the solo singing. For that, I suppose you have to hear other versions; even the old ones fare better there. Specifically, I could barely stand the 'alto' of Michael Chance. He was not in good voice here. The high notes are dry and the lows cannot be controlled very well (I was screaming for a Janet Baker to appear). And: I DO NOT dislike countertenors, mind you. Pity. Maybe we have been spoiled in the last thirty years with outstanding countertenors?
I did not find much outstanding in the other singers, Kooy (the bass) and Crook (the tenor) are solid and Schlick left me cold (this time). Given the year (1989) they were possibly starting their long Bach career and did better afterwards (as my vast Bach cantata collection shows).
The above notwithstanding, the rest is quite wonderful. Conductor, pacing, baroque orchestra, choir. Plus truly outstanding, state-of-the-art sound. For all that, there goes my 4-star count.",1515369600,4

10512,2814,3589,"Been listening to Kansas since their  first album  all the way through Monolith , which by the way is surely a severly underated album  love seeing those old 70's videos  Kirshner's show along with Saturday Night Live was always the highlight of the weekend  as far as TV entertainment and they always showed an old Star Trek after SNL for an added bonus. I know it sounds kinda lame now but you took what you could get in those days and was glad for it. Which brings me back to Miracles Out of Nowhere. A more appropriate title you couldn't dream up. The fact that Kansas is even in the news is a miracle. The story of Kansas is right out of a Hollywood script , solid gold , cue the Solid Gold Dancers, crank it up and enjoy some of the best music from the Seventies. Bonus cd to listen to in your car or wherever. Although the interviews between songs is purely bush league. I bought the No Place Like Home bluray and I'm gonna watch it again when I finish this review. I highly recommend both.",1515542400,5

Theres only like 5 songs on the album I was feeling. I still think Fifth Harmony needs more club bangers. This is my 1st purchase of the girls and very well might be my last!

3.5 stars.

10571,549,3593,"It is honestly very sad whenever someone young and talented dies early. That has been the case already with the passing of their voice, Lemmy Kilmester, whom died back in late 2015 after having a sever battle with cancer. But that isn't alone just in regards to the passing of Lemmy. Sadly, the last surviving member of the original lineup of Motorhead has passed away. With the death of ""Fast"" Eddie Clark, it is a sad and heartbreaking reminder of what really great hard core rock music really was. Motorhead has had so many albums that drove in regards to Rock Music, but out of all of the songs and albums they have made in the world, Motorhead has had only one opus that really has withstood the test of time, with the release of Ace Of Spades. The song is just a fast and fierce anthem that really could rival with other 80's rock anthems like Pour Some Sugar On Me from Def Leppard & AC/DC's opus Back In Black. In any regards, if you have loved this song because of the legacy Motorhead had with Lemmy, you'll honor it for ""Fast"" Eddie Clark As Well.

10651,549,462,"It is honestly a heartbreaking moment, whenever somebody talented & gifted dies with a broken heart. When I had heard about the devastating death of Dolores O' Riordan, whom had fronted the cranberries throughout the 90's, I was shocked. It is so sad that she would die in the same way that we had lost George Michael a little over a year ago. She had a unique gift, but sadly, she let it go to waste, just as much with the same demons that plagued other divas whom had died young like Amy Winehouse and Whitney Houston. When I do think of their music, I think of it as a ladies' alternative to the success that U2 had garnered throughout the decades in hard rock. There have been some of The Cranberries songs that still do stand out today, but Linger was the first hit that still remains as stark and haunting, as the day it had came out. It truly is a song worth noticing from the soul, especially if you have never heard a Cranberries song before. This is the song that I sincerely recommend that you do go to first, as a everlasting memory to Dolores.

10684,2846,632,"As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you  a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues, left behind him
And they have no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie

Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

Annie are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie, (Daggonit)
Annie are you okay? (Daggonit baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Daggonit baby)
There's a sound at the window (Daggonit baby)

And this song--it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.  If you've never heard a Cranberries record--this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound.",1516579200,5

10756,2842,2101,"I must have heard some of this record on KSAN because I remember wanting this one badly.
The saxophone starts up in ""Get Ready"" and that alone makes the entire ride a pleasure. This is just one rockin' record and if you want to celebrate in style you need not look any longer. This is a tight band and the gruff vocals from the drummer sound perfect on top of this relentless music. I always thought Rare Earth gave Chicago a run for the money but today you don't hear them mentioned enough.

One of the greatest live records you have never heard.
FIVE STARS!!!",1516665600,5

Producers made Nancy sing very softly on this so she didn't screw this one up.  Nancy does a very weird low harmony part that has been drastically improved upon by Nicole Kidman on the remake.",1516752000,4
