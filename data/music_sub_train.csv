3,3,3,"At 99 cents, what's not to like?! Actually this is a great, eclectic collection of piano rags, most by Scott Joplin and played by the ragtime expert and composer William Bolcom, who plays them in a similar way as Joshua Rifkin: slow and easy, the way Joplin wanted. No honkytonk saloon music here! Also, there are rags by Joseph Lamb and some others including female composers and pianists. As a bonus, several piano works of the American composer and salon pianist (America's Chopin!) Louis Moreau Gottschalk. These are not rags but apparently Gottschalk was a major influence on the ragtime music movement, especially Joplin. They are wonderful pre-ragtime selections from the latter half of the 19th century, and were popular in the salons of the upper crust. Salon piano music was sort of the pop instrumental music of its time, but Gottschalk was a serious composer as well. These pieces show it. They are melodic--like good ragtime--and easy on the ears. Many of his songs (like The Dying Poet) were used as background for silent movies and became so common as to be cliche, thus the loss of popularity for Gottschalk's music (and other salon music) until revivals began in the late 20th century. Eugene List, a classical pianist, performs the Gottschalk.
If you like ragtime, or pop piano music in general, this is a no-brainer--especially at 99 cents for 111 songs!",1479168000,5

19,0,17,This was in 1970. It was one of my favorite tunes of that year. The arrangement reminds me of the style the band 'Chicago' produced during those years. It has the same kind of spunk to it. The MP3 file sound is acceptable.,1479168000,5

31,0,28,"That was back in 1974. I was with Uncle Sam (Army) and had been assigned to Germany. AFN Radio played it every day, and it was in the Snack Bar jukebox. I had just met a girl, my future wife, and all was well. I am typically not a fan of the genre this band represents, but this tune I really liked and it brings back fond memories of good times. The sound is quite good.",1479168000,5
32,0,29,"This song brings back a strange memory. This was in 1967. The Nam War was escalating. There was this young woman I was casually acquainted with. I wound up sitting in my car with her, talking to her for some 2-3 hours, trying to convince her not to send a 'Dear John Letter' to her boyfriend in Vietnam. I had the radio on at a low volume. When I was almost done with my pitch, this song came on. I turned up a little for her to hear it better. She suddenly had tears running down her, sobbing a little. She turned the radio off. She hugged me briefly, kissing me on the cheek. She opened the car door and got out. She turned around and said: ""Thank you. Roger. I won't send this letter. It would be very cruel of me to do that. You see, I was so afraid to lose him. Instead, I will write him to tell him how much I love him and how much I miss him. Then I will hope for the best. Thank you so much, Roger, for rattling my cage."" Then she scurried away. Ten months later, they got married, in spite of his left leg missing.",1479168000,5
33,15,30,"Muse just keeps getting better and better with each album. ""Drones"" is co-produced by Robert ""Mutt"" Lange, which I must admit, I had my reservations about. He was a popular music producer in the '80s, but he lost credibility for me later in his career, but thankfully his ""studio magic"" is back in a big way with ""Drones"". This is STILL a Muse album so expect big and crazy guitars riffs, catchy melodies, and a nostalgic but modern sound. You can hear a little of that '80s nostalgia on ""Mercy"" (a haunting and deeply emotional mid-tempo track) and ""Dead Inside"" (a synth-heavy juggernaut about a broken relationship). There are some beautiful ballads like ""Aftermath"" and ""Drones"" (the harmonies are insane). ""The Globalist"" is a 10+ minute masterpiece. Probably the most experimental track. I love the whistling intro, piano riff, sound effects, and string arrangement. Matthew Bellamy's voice is still in fine form. HE CAN SING ANYTHING. His range is astounding and HUGE. A lot of people complained about the lyrics on ""Drones"" but I think they are good. Simple but good. The lyrics on ""Psycho"" are NOT terrible, they are very tongue-in-cheek. Bellamy doesn't take himself too seriously. It's good he has a sense of humor. ""Psycho"" is simply amazing but I could've done without the drill sergeant dialogue (too distracting). The verses are gorgeous and the hook is awesome. And that riff! Wow. ""Reapers"" is the BEST track. It's another song that has mind-blowing riffs. Bellamy puts his falsetto to good use on the chorus. Again, wow. ""Defector"" and ""The Handler"" are also hard-hitting tracks. Great arrangements and the chord changes are impressive. ""Revolt"" is a solid mid-tempo track. I like the message of the song. Very inspiring. Is there anything this band can't do? They are insanely talented. ""Drones"" is a concept album. Usually concept albums are a hit-or-miss for me, but ""Drones"" works because the theme and tone of the album is ever-present. This album is political but NOT in an obnoxious or self-righteous way. It's dark, edgy, and above all else, HIGHLY entertaining. BUY. THIS. ALBUM. NOW.  Enjoy!",1479168000,5

I felt somehow sheepish about that. My friends talked me out of enlisting and that I was too old for that crap or such. This tune by 'Steam' stuck in my ears. So it brings back some memories, dubious in nature. Later, when I was 30, I enlisted anyway, and I'm still glad I did. Good song, good sound.",1479168000,5

73,36,66,"Leonard Cohen was a modern-day master poet/singer/songwriter. A true musical hero now gone. This song was written by Cohen quite a few years ago, but it fits into our political climate like it was written yesterday. He writes songs from the heart and I consider this Canadian-born poet a better songwriter and singer than Bob Dylan, who he is compared with often, but Cohen sounds nothing like Dylan. He sounds like no one else. Perfect song to start out with if you never heard of Cohen. And it is not religious if that is what you were thinking by the title. You have to listen to the lyrics and if you aren't teared-up by the end, you aren't human.",1479254400,5

125,59,109,"Bruno Mars is clearly One of the Baddest artists going today. as a songwriter, singer and musician not to mention as  a live act he got his thing together.  he came back with an album which was a tribute to the 80's and 90's and he wears his many influences on his sleeve. however he has his touch and one thing is that certain is that he can tap into the pulse of what is happening and yet take it back. he got more jams here which are on point. he got himself a  really  good album here and Bruno is versatile enough to last a really long tine and  he can beat you in various ways. he still is quite young in his career,however you can sense a artist who has a old school vibe with a new school approach which will be years of  greatness still to come.",1479427200,4

132,61,115,"That's 4 and add a half Stars, okay?So glad to once again own a copy of Stoneground's ""Family Album"" on CD now. Thank you Amazon and BGO for re- issuing a fine album from yesteryear!!! Am listening now to The Move's ""Looking On "" that arrived today as well. Well, what to say...? Stoneground was definitely a band of Hippies and Sal Valentino of the former Beau Brummel's who did the superlative song "" Laugh, Laugh"" , about the only song they did that was ever worthwhile, to my ears anyway. The Medicine Ball Caravan they they toured the USA with were a rolling Kool-Aide Acid Test , much like Mr. Kesey's Crew( who went on to sell yogurt before it was fashionable in Eugene OR under the label Nancy's Yogurt) Was it ""Safe As Milk""? Let's just say I never got "" High "" sampling his new product...stingy! Anyway, having this album back in my collection is like running into a dear old friend again, so I guess it makes me part of the Family,so to speak. Is it their best album...no (altho BGO hasn't remastered a bad album yet, considering the source material they have to deal with, great Company by the way...they care!)so, what is their very best album from Warner Bros. Record label? It is an album claimed to never have been released as their debut according to Collector's Choice Music in their booklet info for the ""s/t "" disc. Hogwash!' Sorry, Groundhogs! I actually owned the disc in prehistoric times (as an old dinosaur I can say that), it featured George Harrison playing on it with them and the cover art showed the group sitting around in a circle in a brown desert, I believe with their guitars stretched out in the circle if I remember correctly. Perhaps the Masters have been lost, if not, I look forward to BGO getting ahold of it...From Warner Bros. ?) and issuing it before I end up in the Big Tar-Pit!...in other wierds, ""Soon!""

1. The song skips several times at the beginning.
2. Intermittent rap insert. Better if just spoken in adult words and phases 3. The use of profanity. God doesn't have a last name. Profanity in rap probably the reason its sells.",1479513600,2

183,83,154,"""Light Has Come"" is a collection of thirteen Christmas carols (two are combined into a medley) arranged and performed for solo piano by John Albert Thomas. Thomas mentions in the liner notes that Christmas was a sacred time for his family and how much he always enjoyed getting together with his church family to sing Christmas hymns. For this album, I decided to add my own style to some of those favorites It is my way of worshipping the Light who came into the world. I hope it brings peace to your heart as well. The album was recorded at Piano Haven Studios in Sedona, AZ on Joe Bongiornos wonderful Shigeru Kawai grand piano. The piano sound is warm and velvety-smooth - a perfect match for Thomas soulful arrangements and playing style. The arrangements are not flashy, but are full and rich, expressing the beauty of the melodies and the religious significance of the songs rather than being party music. Thomas has assembled an interesting combination of songs, most of which are familiar, but there are a few less-often heard gems as well.

""Light Has Come"" begins with O Holy Night. I find it really interesting that when I was growing up, this gorgeous song always seemed to be presented in a dark, almost tragic setting. Over the past couple of decades, the mood of the song has lightened considerably, and Thomas arrangement is almost light-hearted and celebratory, which seems right. Although the title sounds depressing, In the Bleak Midwinter conveys the stillness and quiet of a winter landscape. Thomas arrangement is very peaceful and very beautiful. Go Tell It on the Mountain is light and playful. How Great Our Joy and Break Forth, O Beauteous Heavenly Light were not familiar to me, but both are beautiful traditional German carols with reflective, haunting melodies. Silent Night makes great use of the piano dampers to create a feeling of shimmering stillness and open space - an exceptionally nice arrangement of this Christmas standard. Picardy/Carol of the Bells is the medley, and its another haunting beauty. Picardy is an old French carol and the melody has been used for several carols, including Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence. Im always amazed at how well Carol of the Bells adapts to so many different styles and treatments, and this one is exceptional - my favorite track on the album! It Came Upon the Midnight Clear is light and joyful, bringing this lovely Christmas album to a close with a smile.

""Light Has Come"" would be a beautiful addition to any collection of Christmas music and is sure to add musical joy to the season for years to come. Recommended!",1479600000,5

Touchingly, Paul and Ringo play on this song, the first time all three performed together after the Beatles breakup (and only time aside from the Free as a Bird and Real Love singles released for their Anthology 1 and 2 albums in 1995/1996. This song is upbeat, it sort of reminds me of Crackerbox Palace which was another single a few years earlier.

380,153,314,"This is a rather difficult review to write, first because Im rather fond of Gaslight Anthem, and secondly because I dearly want to be inspired to like this solo project from Brian Fallon.

If theres one characteristic that Fallon carries around with him and refuses to let go of, its his penchant for spending too much time looking in his rearview mirror, over his shoulder, and his downright desire to be anyone other than who he actually is.  As to the rearview mirror aspect, if one listens to the mans lyrics on both the Gaslight Anthem albums and this solo outing, Brian seems to fear that his past is creeping up on him, and in so doing, that past is eventually going to catch up with him, and at that moment in time, hes going to have to come face to face with the present, the here and now, and his place in it.  When that time comes, Im sincerely hoping that his visions are focused on the future, because essentially there is nothing one can write about that happened a mere two hours in the past, over breakfast, so hes gonna have to face a future, and write about some things hed like to see happen, about dreams he longs to have come true, rather than resurrecting a past for which no one can do anything about.

As to him wishing to be someone else, on The 59 Sound, a song by Gaslight Anthem, he waxes longingly that he wishes he looked like Elvis, and then goes on to allude to Sam Space in Casablanca on the album jacket, while Gaslight has yet another song entitled Steve McQueen.  Of course wed all like to be someone other than ourselves at times  but theres a genuine difference between that, and not coming to grips with the fact that we are who we are.  Of course one could easily point to Springsteen when it comes to either of these aspects, yet Bruce wasn't so much living in the past, its more that he was revealing himself to us, telling us his stories, what made him who he is as he moved into the present.  And yes, one could certainly infer that Springsteens most interesting and beloved albums came from viewing his past.  And while thats all well and good, Bruce accepted those nostalgic characters, those struggling years, owing them, making them his own, while Fallon seems to be trying to out run them, as if by giving them voice, they will turn to dust, no longer being present to torment his mind.

Theres no mistaking that Pain Killers obsessively belongs to Brian Fallon  its chocked full of idyllic images of an America that no longer exists, and probably never existed as Fallon has come to romanticize it; with that romanticization shading both the good and negative aspects of his plagued memories.  Frankly, Fallons become sort of a parody of himself, after all, how many girls named Maria, and how many times can he image a late night diner before actual cracks appear, and folks begin to think that they're hearing their the same old songs through a new set of speakers.

I so wish that Brian Fallon would grasp the idea that even the losers get lucky some times [to paraphrase Tom Petty], because I actually like hearing the man sing, investing myself in his visions, and listening to his narratives.  Each song from Pain Killers feels as if the man is standing outside of not so much himself, but of real life, giving me the sensation that even as Fallon is holding faded photographic images, those images are bleaching in the sun, leaving him with only impressions of not only those images, but of his memory, where nothing can be trusted as truth.

With all that being said, Pain Killers is the sort of thing that draws me in, like a cheap pulp novel you read and leave on the seat of the crosstown bus when you're finished.  Nothing here is a keeper, but what Fallon does do is linger in my mind, where his memories mesh with mine, where I feel not so much alone knowing that Brian Fallon is out there reminding me that perhaps in this day and age, the past is not such a bad place to stake a claim.

What was unusual, at the time, was the fact that it was performed by a Australian group. In fact, The Seekers were the first Aussie group that entered US and UK charts. Great folk music it was. The performance is outstanding. The MP3 sound is excellent. In 1967, I saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show. I bought more of their stuff.",1480204800,5

Many, many reviewers love this album, but I'm not one of them.
Yes, traditional Christmas Carols can be reinterpreted and this is a case in point, but too often for me the songs just don't take off as those on their Worship albums do.
I've given this a second listening, but still can't give more than 3 stars.

Truthfully, the entire Greatest Hits album this song is featured on is worth purchasing, but if you're low on funds or new to Tom Petty's music and want to discover what The Heartbreakers are all about, purchasing this song is definitely a good way to go.

Foster and Chris Pine.  Unfortunately, this song was NOT on the soundtrack, so I had to order it solo. This song (as nearly all the songs on the soundtrack) was placed appropriately at a key scene and fit right into the storyline.  It is a haunting song, especially if you hear it in conjunction with the movie. The song has a simple guitar accompaniment for background and Gillian's voice resonates the mood of the title.

Bruno cites artists like Babyface, Jam & Lewis, New Edition among others, as the driving force behind this release.  24K MAGIC starts the ball rolling funky style and from there, it's song and song and not a dud in the bunch.  His vocals and style shine thru and thru and just make the most of a release that cheats the listener, because there is only 9 songs here, when it could have been longer.  His groovy side slides thru and his softer side shines just as bright and his voice carries the entire disc with the strength of an artist who has been in the game longer than he actually has been.  He is one of those classic acts that knows what the crowds want to hear and he gives it all to them....and you better receive.  YOU GO, BRUNO!!!",1481241600,5

Luckily, there are some serious ears and minds out there, and this time it seems they gave their respected opinion above. I took the chance of buying and do not regret it. Thus, I second the exuberance of those comments.
While I resist to say that any recording of a Mahler symphony is ""perfect"" (such great music preclude me from stating it) this recording is just about the best 10th out there. The stars of conducting, playing and recording were aligned. Extraordinary.
Someone said this recording came 'from left field'. It seems so indeed.

Halestorm is a band that can't really be appreciated until you've seen them play live in concert.  No CD can truly capture the energy of a live concert, but this CD does a pretty good job of it.

The songs from the 1960s and 1970s have a certain sound from that era, and lyrics demonstrating social change. I am a science major and not very creative. I have always found it fascinating how artists (painters, sculptors, writers, musicians, ... song writers) are inspired by social change and create their best works. So now that I am older with a fewer more dollars in my pocket, I can buy and enjoy music of my early youth. I really like Neal Young and Steven Stills.

Evie's voice is absolutely beautiful and the songs are arranged perfectly; going from festive cheer to traditional carols, to very spiritual songs such as Oh Holy Night, performed the way only Evie can do! These songs also appeal to children. This ""album"" then CD and now ""music list"" has been the favorite during the Christmas season in our home decade after decade.

1448,510,1033,"I'm listening to this right now.  I listened to Sremm Life on Amazon Prime and really like it.  Though I haven't listened to rap in awhile I heard Black Beatles and then after liking Sremm Life 1 I decided to get it.  I really really like it.  I live in Memphis and grew up in West TN so I have always been a Three Six Mafia fan (along with Juicy J, Project Pat, Frayser Boy, etc) and some of the songs take me back to the old Three Six style.  If you are curious just pull up the album and listen to it on YouTube first.  The last few songs kind of trail off but the first and the middle is bumpin'.  I'll be listening to this for awhile!

Being from Tupelo it's obvious they are influenced by Three Six and Memphis rap.  There is a track with Juicy J where they throw a Three Six line in at the end.  Also the Project Pat reference on the first album kind of pulled me in.  I like Rae Sremmurd and will keep supporting them by buying their music.

There is some country since 2000 that I like but what passes for country today is nothing more than rock music being sung with a southern twang.  IMO  I'm a fan of Tim McGraw but like his older stuff better.  This album has some nice songs, especially Shotgun Rider and Meanwhile Back At Mama's.",1482537600,3

1568,535,1093,nice song; RIP George Michaels,1482624000,4
1569,549,1094,"I am just truly devastated to hear such somber and tragic news, that on December 25th, 2016, George Michael had tragically died at the somber and young age of 53. I am truly crushed that he, once one of the most soulful and talented singers that had ever came out of the 80's would actually pass on at such a sad death from heart failure. He was one of a kind, with any song he had done, soulfully from his sweet voice, and true essence from every song he had performed on his own, and when he was a part of Wham! One of my all-time favorite songs of George's was when he teamed up with Elton John on Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me in 1991. The song still reminds of a sweet collaboration that really hit the souls eyes, with so much in the way of loss from AIDS like when Freddie Mercury of Queen died that year. George was amazing at any song he had done from past and present, and every song he made was met with beauty and blessings from any he wrote, and others he covered on his own. It is just tragic that today, the world let the sun go down on him, but George Michael's legacy will be forever from the sweet and dear eyes of a truly blue-eyed soul.

George Michael:  1963 - 2016  May he and his mom dance with the sun again!!!

Just know that with this album, it's not just Guy singing.  Nearly every song is him with the Gaither Vocal Band (one of my favorites) singing a solo in the song or with him singing the lead.  It's definitely not a SOLO album.  That being said, it's still a wonderful addition to your music library and you'll be pleased you did so.",1482710400,4

To be honest I don't even recognize the names of some of the other singers or groups with tracks on this CD so make sure to do your homework, which I didn't, before you plop down the money.  Even the 3 songs by Zac Brown were nothing to write home about.  A compilation album that should never have been put together in my opinion.  I've already given my copy to Good Will.

Alessia Cara write intelligent and thoughtful lyrics and ""Scars to your beautiful"" is a condemnation of the beauty and plastic surgery industries.

1641,572,1138,"This is the two CD collector's edition version of the Speedway soundtrack album, by Follow That Dream Records.  Generally, these ""deluxe"" editions of the albums include several alternate takes of the songs.  In this case, there must not have been very many alternate takes available, because there are only FOUR alternate takes of the movie songs included, although they did include a few alternate takes of the ""bonus songs"" that were not recorded for the movie from the original album.  The bulk of the material is THREE different mixes of the movie songs.  You get the original stereo album.  You get the original mono album, which by the way is one of the rarest Elvis albums, since they stopped making mono albums soon after it came out.  And you get the ""remixed soundtrack masters"", which feature the engineer announcing the take number before the songs and some of the songs go longer instead of fading out like on the original mixes.  This is a pricey collection and is really only for hardcore Elvis fans.",1482796800,3

1676,15,1159,"""Badlands"" by Halsey is what you call a ""spur of the moment"" purchase. I didn't know much about Halsey (besides the song, ""Ghost) but I'm extremely impressed with this astonishing album. Her music is electro-pop. I love that genre of music but it's a tricky genre to make just right, cohesively. Sometimes electro-pop can come off manufactured, flat, or too glossy. ""Badlands"" is the perfect balance of dark, gutsy, and haunting pop, but it's still catchy, playful, and fresh. I got this album at Target. I think the Target version is worth it if you're looking for more tracks. My version has 16 tracks instead of 11. More bang for your buck! There's 5 essential tracks that I can't get enough of: ""Castle"", ""Hurricane"", ""Colors"", ""Haunting"", and ""Control"". Halsey's voice is really pretty (very melodic). I like that she doesn't scream the songs. She's easy to understand. She doesn't sing like she has marbles in her mouth. There's really not one bad song in the bunch. ""Hold Me Down"", ""New Americana"", ""Young God"", ""Coming Down"", and ""Roman Holiday"" are absolutely stellar. I love ""Drive"". It's very laid-back but emotional. ""Colors Pt. II"" is a short remix but it's lovely. ""Ghost"" was the track that made me a Halsey fan. ""Gasoline"" and ""Strange Love"" are incredibly hypnotic. There's an awesome cover of Johnny Cash's, ""I Walk the Line"". I love Halsey's interpretation. The track is stripped down (love the piano) and so romantic. ""Badlands"" is worth it just for ""Hurricane"". I could listen to that song all day. Musically, this is the best electro-pop album I've ever heard. You can tell Halsey and the producers worked really hard to make this record sound flawless and meaningful. The hooks, melodies, lyrics, and arrangements are remarkable. She's such an underrated artist. I hope she makes another album soon. This is good music. Enjoy!",1482883200,5

1682,591,1161,"What a great record! Soul,  RnB and rock perfectly mixed by this great singer/composer. I found out about this great album when i was flipping pages through an old Rock 'encyclopedia'. It says that this was possibly the best live rock record of all times. That encyclopedia was published in 1977. So maybe there are other good live documents recorded after this one. But since (at least for me) rock 'died' around 1980 i don't think so. Probably only the Who's Live at Leeds, The Stones Get yer Ya Yas concert, Zappa's Roxy & Elsewhere and Hendrix Band of Gypsys are some of the few contenders capable of competing with this jewel. If you are serious about rock n roll and your neck hair raises when hearing Ray Charles, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, etc. then you DEFINITELY need this album.",1482883200,5

1745,617,115,"By the time California's STONEGROUND released the 2LP-set ""Family Album"" before Christmas of 1971 - their 2nd platter for Warner Brothers in a year  the San Francisco ensemble were a sprawling ten-piece Rock act fronted by ex Beau Brummels singer and guitarist Sal Valentino and featured no less than four other singers - all ladies (see list below).

Their self-titled debut ""Stoneground"" had arrived in April 1971 on Warner Brothers WS 1895 to acclaim but poor sales and their ambitious but again ignored three-sides-live-one-side-studio ""Family Album"" 2LP set came in December 1971 (Warner Brothers 2ZS 1956). These albums were in turn followed by ""Stoneground 3"" on Warner Brothers BS 2645 in December 1972 - yet none bothered the US charts in any real way despite the favourable reviews, great live rep and big-label name (members of the band would morph into the yacht rock act Pablo Cruise and enjoy six charted albums - one of which ""Worlds Apart"" went Top 6 in 1978).

But on hearing this sprawling and at times brilliant double album from that halcyon year - you're left wondering - why? Maybe we missed something back there? I think we did and reissue label 'Beat Goes On' of England seems to think so too. Theres a lot to love on this gorgeous-sounding 2CD reissue of this long-forgotten band and their gatefold shot at fame  there really is. Here are the rocky details...

UK released November 2016 - ""Family Album"" by STONEGROUND on Beat Goes On BGOCD 1263 (Barcode 5017261212634) is a 2CD Reissue of the 2LP set from 1971 (no bonus tracks) and plays out as follows:

Disc 1 (43:19 minutes):
1. Get Rhythm [Side 1]
2. Passion Flower
3. Corrina
4. Big River
5. Won't Be Long [Side 2]
6. Super Clown
7. Richland Woman
8. Queen Sweet Dreams
9. Precious Lord
Sal Valentino sings Lead Vocals on ""Get Rhythm"", ""Big River"" (both Johnny Cash cover versions) and ""Queen Sweet Dreams"" (his own song) and duets with Lynne Hughes on the Traditional ""Corrina"". Lynne Hughes sings Lead Vocals on ""Passion Flower"" (her own song) and ""Richland Woman"" (a Mississippi John Hurt cover) - Annie Simpson sings Lead Vocals on the spiritual ""Precious Lord"".

Disc 2 (43:30 minutes):
1. It Takes A Lot To Laugh (It Takes A Train To Cry) [Side 3]
2. I Can't Help It
3. Ro Doreen
4. It's Not Easy
5. If You Gotta Go
6. Total Destruction Of Your Mind
7. You Must Be One Of Us [Side 4]
8. All My Life
9. Where Will I Find Love
10. Gonna Have A Good Time
11. Jam It
Disc 1 and 2 make up the double album ""Family Album"" - released December 1971 in the USA on Warner Brothers 2ZS 1956 (no UK issue). Sides 1, 2 and 3 recorded live by KSAN Radio in San Francisco, Sunday 8 August 1971 using the Pacific High Recording Studios in front of an audience of 200 invited guests. Side 4 is the studio side (Tracks 7 to 11 on Disc 2) and was recorded at the Record Plant in Los Angeles.

STONEGROUND was:
SAL VALENTINO - Lead Vocals, Guitar and Percussion
TIM BARNES - Lead Guitar and Backing Vocals
CORY LERIOS - Keyboards
JOHN BLAKELEY - Bass
BRIAN GODULA - Bass
STEPHEN PRICE - Drums
LYNNE HUGHES - Vocals
DEIRDRE LA PORTE - Vocals
ANNIE SIMPSON - Vocals
LYDIA MORENO - Vocals

BGO's now generic card slipcase adds the 2016 2CD reissue a classy look and JOHN O'REGAN's 12-page liner notes give a potted and affectionate history of the band's many line-up changes explaining their lack of commercial success. The original double vinyl LP was a gatefold sleeve laid out (not surprisingly) in a 'family album' way with pictures of all 10 players on the inner gatefold - that spread is reproduced on the inner two page spread. I still can't definitively say who sings lead on which track (the original never said) and O'Regan doesn't illuminate either. But I can say that audio-wise this is a gorgeous-sounding recording - a beautiful 'high definition' audiophile transfer from original masters that really gives the recordings an ethereal, loose and casually cool feel.

Stoneground's sound isn't easy to nail - probably a good reason as to why they were difficult to market. Best approximation when Valentino is singing is Little Feat live with Leon Russell at the microphone - a combo most Seventies Rock fans would gladly embrace. They also had a knack of making very obvious 'cover versions' their own - and this is evident in their very Stoneground takes on Johnny Cash's ""Get Rhythm"" and their boogie organ-driven version of Dylan's ""If You Gotta Go"" turned into a Soul raver with one of the ladies getting all Tina Turner on its funky ass.

Reviewers complained at the time that the clearly sparse 200 audience members seemed just a little too vocal in their appreciation of the group giving some of the live cuts a false feel  but Id say that this happens so little  its an utterly mute point. The real problem is a lack of killer hits  the songs are good and at times the rhythms funky and inspired  but theres no Top 10 hit on here. Even when they're tackling the Jerry Williams song Total Destruction Of Your Mind which they funk up into a sort of Geno Washington and The Ram Jam Band rave up complete with drum solo  or have a go at Dusty Springfields Wont Be Long turning it into an Aretha Franklin Atlantic Records bopper  they sound like a great covers band  its good but not distinctive enough to make their own mark.

The lonesome slide guitar and lone voice of ""Precious Lord"" is chillingly brilliant though  sparse - like Ry Cooder sat on a chair with Doris Troy letting rip on a microphone nearby  her eyes closed  feeling every righteous word. Of the studio stuff Ron Nagle's ""You Must Be One Of Us"" has Sal Valentino sounding like the recently passed Leon Russell finding his inner Delta Lady. Keyboardist Cary Lerios supplied the mushy love song ""All My Life"" while Lynne Hughes gives us the better ""Where Will I Find Love""  a very Delaney and Bonnie Soul-Rock funky dancer. There's amazing audio on the I-feel-good rocker ""Gonna Have A Good Time and near six-minute instrumental ""Jam It"" chugs along like The Allman Brothers having a Rock-Funk workout in the studio in-between ""Brothers And Sisters"" outtakes.

Piano player Pete Sears who played on their debut would later feature in Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship and along with Ian McLagan became a member of the house band that played on Rod Stewart's mighty trio of classic albums - ""Gasoline Alley"", ""Every Picture Tells A Story"" and ""Never A Dull Moment"". Cory Lerios, Steve Price and David Jenkins would form Pablo Cruise and sign to A&M Records for major chart success in the Seventies. Stoneground went on make more albums that no one remembers - even returning to Warner Brothers in 1978 for the ""Hearts Of Stone"" LP in 1978. There's a website to the band that tells you bugger all info about them...

To sum up - there's much to dig here and as I listen to the announcer tell the audience to 'give it up' for his children in Stoneground (his words title this review) - I'm thinking he was onto to something with the ignored double ""Family Album"".

Fans of 1971 need to check this superb-sounding 2CD reissue out. And well done to BGO for doing such a top quality job...",1482969600,4

1760,623,1213,"The popular American actress and singer Debbie Reynolds broke into show business at the tender age of 19 back in 1950 with her portrayal of singer Helen Kane in the feature film ""Three Little Words"".  Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.  Just a few months later Debbie would score a Top Ten hit with her first single ""Aba Daba Honeymoon"".  And after her memorable performance in the 1952 musical comedy ""Singin"" In The Rain"" with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor the name Debbie Reynolds would be forever etched in the folklore of Hollywood.  Given her vocal prowess many people expected Debbie Reynolds to become a fixture on the Billboard pop charts.  You might be surprised to learn that this simply was not the case.

It would be another five years and 14 films before Debbie Reynolds would have another hit record.  It does not appear that a recording career was a top priority for her.  In 1957 she co-starred with Leslie Nielson and Walter Brennan in the romantic comedy ""Tammy And The Bachelor"".  The song ""Tammy"" made its debut in that film and was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Original Song.  The tune was a massive hit with the record-buying public as well.  ""Tammy"" would remain on the Billboard Hot 100 for an unheard of 31 weeks and spend 5 big weeks at the top of the charts.  Over the next couple of years Debbie Reynolds would have a couple of more hits but nothing could compare with the popularity of ""Tammy"".  i suppose that in this day and age most people would consider a song like ""Tammy"" to be pure unadulterated schmaltz.  But in my opinion, there is something to be said for such schmaltz.  Even as a teenager in the 1960's I loved this song.

Jimmy had a few more hits, but this one is the most remarkable, in my opinion. It was intended to be a country tune, but it crossed over to the pop charts.",1482969600,5

1782,628,619,"Just so you know, I really want to love Skillet. Ive really enjoyed much of their work including their last release Rise but theres something brewing that I don't like and Unleashed displays it: John Coopers singing is dominating all the songs. The band doesnt take long enough to let any of these songs breathe and develop so they all end up sounding really, really similar; really formulaic. And its sounding old. I realize that Skillet is a modern rock band who has always placed a lot of emphasis on a lot of vocals and I like Coopers voice (most of the time) but too much sometimes is just thattoo much. I think that this album is an example of that and it reminds me of Creeds last release (Full Circle) where pretty early on I wanted Scott Stapp to stop singing so I could listen to the music (mind you, I like Stapps vocals). While Unleashed doesnt sink down to quite that level it gets close and I wish the songs were more interesting, more musically developed, and that Cooper would hold back and let the music sit on its own more or that he and drummer Jen Ledger would share vocals more than they do. This at least helps change up the dynamics between songs and helps make the album as a whole more listenable. As such I Want To Live is one of the albums better songs IMO both for the male/female vocals and for the symphonic music. Stars and Lions may be my favorite songs off this release and they are more synth dance songs than rock songs. Meanwhile songs like Feel Invincible, Back From the Dead, Undefeated, and especially tracks Out of Hell and Burn It Down generate the my main criticisms. So all Im saying is that I want to see them break away from the mold (stadium anthems) and play around an album throughout its track list. Their last great album was Collide. I think they have one more great album in them. Heres hoping.",1483056000,3

1798,549,1210,"It is just so sad, whenever someone young and talented throws their life away, and dies at a much earlier age. That sadly was the case with George Michael. Sadly, he passed away on December 25th, 2016 and many people have been really taking a hard look at his legacy, and the beauty that he had shown as a artist. From boy toy, to gay activist, he had so many remarkable and beautiful songs that struck at the soul of the heart alone. That was why he had been a really brilliant and beautiful singer and songwriter. One of my favorite songs from his landmark solo debut album, Faith is Father Figure. It is a lovely song that really shows brilliance and beauty from the soul's eyes. It is a track that I think shows how brilliant George was working his craft so well, at the heart of the matter, when it comes to love. It is a remarkable song, that still delivers so nobly well. If you are just discovering George Michael, because of the impact of his tragic death, than you'll definitely want to check out this song. I recommend it.

1826,642,671,"This is an easy review to write, since all I have to do is to refer to the other reviews here, which pretty much mirror the critical acclaim for this performance; I think it now takes the crown. Among other renditions, I love the Simon Rattle 10th with Berlin (cut my teeth on this one), and also respect Eliahu Inbal's, and will return to them both. But this new one with Dausgaard and the Seattle pretty much goes right to the top of the list. If you believe Mahler's 10th can be performed, and if you believe Deryk Cooke's performing version is the way to go, all I can add is: ""wow...this is IT."" And: Ralph Moore, thanks once again for the steer here.

1910,655,1291,"I am a long-time fan of Bruce Hornsby, have seem him in concert, own virtually all of his albums, etc.  As much as I love the 80s and early 90s material which everyone (ok, classic rock fans) knows, I have most enjoyed his more recent work where he has branched out and kept exploring different musical styles and ideas.  My favorite BH album may just be Spirit Trail from 1998, the sprawling double-disc that many critics described as ""self-indulgent"" but was really just the man being himself with all of his musical quirks out in the open.  Since that time we've had stabs at hip-hop (Big Swing Face), sophisticated but decidedly weird pop (Halcyon Days), bluegrass (Cluck Ol' Hen with Ricky Skaggs), a sprawling live album which re-worked some of his best recent material (Bride of the Noisemakers), solo concerts, and now an album which features BH on an entirely different instrument than the one which made him famous.  I can see why BH may have lost everyone but the die-hards by now, but for those of us who love BH's musical adventurousness this is a great time to be among his fan base.

This new disc is full of great new compositions as well as some re-worked classics.  I am not going to do a full track-by-track review but I will say that (going in the order in which they appear) ""Over the Rise"" is a great and engaging opener, ""Soon Enough"" is deeply touching, ""M.I.A. in M.I.A.M.I."" and ""Tipping"" are hilarious, ""Rehab Reunion"" is clever, ""Tropical Cashmere Sweater"" is moving, ""TSA Man"" is again hilarious and timely, ""The Valley Road"" is a worthy re-imagining of a classic, and ""Celestial Railroad"" is a real (nice, soulful) surprise.  The music as a whole has a stripped-down appeal and is rootsy without sacrificing production quality.  As other reviewers I have read have pointed out, BH has never sounded more relevant.  This is a classic album and also very much of our times.  It's a real treasure.

I hope BH keeps expanding his musical horizons (no disco or emo though!).  I have really been enjoying everything he has done for the past few decades.",1483228800,5

1958,673,1317,Where I Left Off is a pleasing body of work. Your mastery of the keyboard is highlighted in each sound. The movement through each note delivers a specific gesture of emotion. Although this is very confident and assertive the listener is comforted and carried on a journey filled with adventures. Ohh Baby is charged with the movement of the sounds lead by the keyboard. The play between the horns and the keyboard arouses the soul. And thats just the first song! Seasons Change is memorable with its certain sweetness. The composition is gorgeous with the ebb and flow of the keyboard in the lead and then saxophone adding a sparkle to the already shimmering fluidity. Your work is stimulating and leaves the listener unquestionably satisfied.,1483315200,5

While John and George have had their own boxed sets released in the past (and good ones, too!!) and Ringo has released a 3-disc ""Anthology"" of himself with his All-Starr Band project(s), Sir Paul was the only one left to compile his massive amount of recordings into a nice collection of exactly what this boxed set holds within it!  You will NOT be bored with any filler or whatever from start to finish.

It's Paul Bloody McCartney, fer crissakes!!!

2028,623,1345,"Jim Croce was a singer/songwriter/guitarist from Philadelphia who burst onto the scene in the summer of 1973 with a #1 single ""You Don't Mess Around With Jim"".  Jim achieved his success the old fashioned way.  During the day he drove a truck and swung a hammer to support his young family and at night he played his music at bars and clubs all over Philly.  His first three singles all made the national Top 40 and in then in the spring of 1973 his 4th release ""Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"" would become his first #1 hit.  It appeared for all the world that Jim Croce was going to be a fixture on the American music scene for a very long time.  Here was an artist that the average Joe could relate to and root for.

Then on September 20, 1973 tragedy struck.  Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in Natchitoches, LA.  He was just 30 years old.  Jim Croce had a backlog of unreleased material in the can and his label ABC continued to release a new single every few months.  His final Top Ten hit was released in February of 1974.  While I loved all of his singles I think ""I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song"" is my favorite.  The song spent 14 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart peaking at #9.  This is the original hit single recording you would remember from the radio.",1483401600,5

2171,730,1408,"Great dance tune, definitely will get people up on the floor.",1483660800,5
2172,15,1409,"""Santigold's third studio album, ""99 Cents"" is a great album full of flavor and style. The only song I have a problem with is, ""Who Be Lovin' Me"". I don't know who this Ilovemakonnen dude is but he's a terrible singer. His voice is so flat and monotone. I can't tell if he's singing bad on purpose or what? I don't know what Santigold was thinking. Ugh. Too bad because the song has a great beat. Anyway, I do enjoy the rest of the tracks but I think her last album, ""Master Of My Make-Believe"" was much better. ""Walking In A Circle"", ""Before The Fire"" and ""Outside The War"" are a little draggy but I like the eerie quality and production. ""Big Boss Big Time Business"" and ""Banshee"" are the most experimental tracks. ""Can't Get Enough Of Myself"", ""Rendezvous Girl"", ""All I Got"", and ""Who I Thought You Were"" are the most traditional new wave tracks and they are absolute stellar. Definitely the highlights here. These 4 songs are loaded with sunny melodies, catchy hooks, and awesome synths. I LOVE the pop gems, ""Chasing Shadows"" (love the handclaps and children's choir) and ""Run the Races"" which is a beautiful, haunting ballad. I also want to mention that Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs plays guitar on ""Outside the War"" and ""Run the Races"". He's a talented guitarist. I really like Santigold. She's not predictable or cookie-cutter. How many black female singers make new wave music? Not many I can think of. She's been around for a while now, and I still feel like more people have no idea who she is and that's a shame. BUY. THIS. NOW. Enjoy!",1483660800,4

2176,732,416,"I purchased this album expecting gospel rap.
Turns out there are a couple of inspirational tracks but the majority are more street related and the artist focusing on himself.

2178,734,1413,favorite band - what can I say??,1483660800,5
2179,735,1414,"If i can give disclosure's latest release a 4.5/5 i would.  I was very close to giving it a 4/5 review, but I found myself comparing this album with the last album.  A lot of the negative reviews comes from disclosure unique sound that was very upbeat and different.  This endeavor utilizes many styles that are popular in today's EDM realm.  Especially when the Weeknd is a featured artist on this album.  Not to say that's a bad thing, but they have went a little ""mainstream"" for this release.

I don't think I'm going to purchase this album on vinyl because it doesn't have the hard hitting, fast paced, up tempo, party tracks as the first one.  When I mix for people I want them to have energy and feel alive.  Caracal is an album that you listen to when your home alone and want to groove.

Last thoughts:  not all of the album has a mellow feel, there are tracks that are more upbeat, but they are very thin throughout the album.

4.5/5 stars.",1483660800,5

2182,736,45,"This was my first 21P recording experience. Below is my first listening reaction.

I suspect that like many I WishListed Blurryface based upon seeing 21P on SNL where they performed Stressed Out and Ride... two very different, very strong tracks with impact and appeal to burn. I was intrigued by the ""newness"" (to me) of the sound and the personality of a bass/piano & drums duo albeit backed by an 8-ish piece string ensemble and an unseen synth lurking somewhere. Of special note was the strength of the drumming vs. past ""power duos"", e.g., White Stripes and Black Keys.

While a couple other tracks approach the SNL two's level, none quite achieve it and others don't come all that close. The reggae influence is present in more tracks than I was expecting. Its use give a feeling of ""sameness"" to some tracks... not a bad thing... just a bit impact diminishing. A couple other tracks were simply ""pop-ish"" and seemed more out of place approaching filler material.

I was very impressed with the SQ of the CD. Everything was clear, clean and well placed in the sound field. Even the most rapid rap riffs were understandable to even my old, non-rap tuned ears.

Bottom Line: Even with the lesser material this is still easily a 4-star listen with enough good material to keep me from having to justify the price based on two outstanding tracks. While right now Blurryface will not send me running to 21P's catalog for more purchases with repeated listenings it may well grow on me.",1483660800,4

2314,763,1405,"Both of Earth Wind & Fire greatest hits albums on one collection.  And some excellent hits, to boot.

The good:  You are getting mostly album versions here.  And they are excellent hits.  Fantasy, After The Love Is Gone, September, Shining Star, Can't Hide Love, That's the Way of the World, Singasong--the list goes on.  Mostly the big hits from the mid 1970s are here, with the inclusion of Let's Groove (a hit in late 1981 and a good one at that).  Missing are the out-takes and filler material.  You get this album, you will wonder how the radio even survives today with Autotunes ruining today's music (you won't find that here).

There are a few time issues, though.  Boogie Wonderland is a bit short running--somewhere out there, I have had a single version running 4:59 and really running the full 4:59.  This runs 4:48.  September is also a bit short, running only 3:34 instead of the 3:37 I have had on the boxed set and vinyl records.  You will not be getting the big R&B only hits from the mid 1980s here, nor will you get the early hits before 1975.  ""Devotion"", found on the boxed set, came out late 1974 and is not here.  Perhaps just as well, since there is only so much space on a single disc and including all the outtakes, R&B only hits from beyond 1981, and the early material would result in a multi-disc set that would cost three times as much.

The album is an excellent value.  The only bad thing I can say that is not a compromise on what will fit is that Boogie Wonderland is only 4:48 when I have heard a 4:59 single version.  I do not expect the 12"" single version that runs 8:25, but I would have liked the label to preserve the regular single version.  Other than that, you will not regret buying the collection.",1483920000,5
2315,763,1481,"I would be careful with this collection.  The songs themselves were well chosen, representing the big hits of Foreigner.  However, they really did a lousy job in giving you album versions.

Most of the songs were either redone or shortened versions.  Hot Blooded, for instance, is only 3:08 here.  On the original album, I have it running 4:30.  The song I Wanna Know What Love Is runs short--it is supposed to be 5:01.  And they do not sound quite right--even where the time is long, it is because it is a new recording.  Better to pay a little more and get a different compilation.

Too bad, because Foreigner is an excellent band for those who like rock but not thrash metal.  The 5 albums this was compiled from are all worthy albums, and I would suggest either getting cuts directly off those albums or picking a different greatest hits album.  There is nothing past 1984 on this album--you will not find anything off their 6th album or from Lou Gramm himself (itself not a major flaw because you can only fit so much material on a single disc without charging more).  But I am not a fan of re-recorded material unless you hate the execution of the originals but not the original songs.",1483920000,2

But wait, this sounds Japanese.  This is a very unique and beautiful cover of the classic.  Regina's voice is so beautiful and she just nails this song, the Beatles can't sing like this.  The use of a Japanese Shamisen and the drumming with sticks makes it very unique.  Japan meets George Harrison!

2356,780,1094,"Never been a huge George Michael fan although enjoyed listening to most of His songs, But have always respected and appreciated his musical talent, voice and the way He sings you can tell it comes from His Soul and Heart!

And this Elton John cover song you can really tell He sings it with meaning again coming from His Soul, The song has always been one of my favorite songs written of course by Bernie Taupin and recorder by Elton John, But George Michael's version recorded live with Elton John just brings it up to another level, Not going to say one version is better than the other!...As its just a great song from either artist with true meanings in the lyrics!

Just wish George Michael recorded a non-live studio recorded version of this song without Elton!...But with no disrespect to Elton in anyway saying that!

But anyway God Speed George Michael...Another truly gifted musical artist that sadly passed away to early in life along with so many other truly gifted musical artists like Bowie, Prince and so many others in the year 2016!.....The year the Music really died!",1484006400,5

2411,736,1519,"Saw Ted/Trucks band on ACL and liked them so WishListed ""Let Me Get By"".

First the music...

While generally classified as Blues-Rock or Blues, I hear a country-rock flavor in many tracks. Not surprising given Trucks' Allman Brothers roots, but I hear more of it in Susan's voice on some tracks. Best example is track 1, ""Anyhow"". While I'm not a ""country fan"", I'm not adverse to a little country flavor... just not into a steady diet of it. And Flavor is all that is here... and only on some tracks adding to the variety and there is nothing if not variety in this 2 disc set.

Other tracks are pure blues including some where Susan's voice is reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt. Track 2, ""Laugh About It"", is an early example. I love Bonnie, but if I heard her in every vocal, then I'd be critical. I didn't, so I'm not.

And then there are tracks that come out of nowhere... juke joint material... rock... just wonderfully varied listening.

Now onto the SQ (Sound Quality). When I saw TTB on ACL there must have been eight or ten players on stage. Guitars, horns, keyboards, string, drums x 2 and backing vocalists. And they all seem to be there on this CD, but when they all play I have issues telling and that's the rub. On the three or four busiest tracks the supporting cast all seem to fall into a mush of sound even sometimes dragging the backup vocals with them. Susan's vocals always rise above as does Derek's guitar work, but there's mired sound below them.

Simpler tracks, like the stripped down ""Swamp Raga..."", are beautifully done, as are those where backing instruments tend to take turns, making the confusion of the bogged down tracks all the more mysterious. Not a reason to avoid purchase of this issue, but potentially a reason to skip a track here and there depending on my mood.",1484092800,4

2582,840,1599,"Another live set that hasn't been reviewed lately so I thought I'd give it it's due.

If you don't already own this gig in another configuration, this is worth adding to your Dead shelf of live music.  This is a broadcast from the Harding Theater in 1971 over KSFX-FM and is  about 3 1/2 hours long.  There's very little DJ chatter but there's band tune-ups between songs.  But for me that only adds authenticity to the listening experience.  The sound overall is decent/good--crisp, fairly clean and open sounding.  But like similar broadcasts there's  a few sonic issues--the worst being the dropouts during ""Brown Eyed Woman"".  But overall this is a nice sounding set.  Lesh's bass is mixed well, the drums don't overpower anything but have a solid sound, and Garcia's guitar is out front (along with everyone's  vocals) where it should be.  To my ears this is one of the better releases of it's kind.

The discs snap  inside a double jewel case with two b&w photos in the trays--one on stage and the other is Garcia with poster artist Victor Moscoso and others.  The two  page booklet has a short essay on the gig and a b&w photo of the Harding Theater.  The cover photo with Pigpen is from another venue.  The case slips inside a thin cardboard box with the same graphics.

This is the concert-warts and all--including the band losing power and wondering what to do.  Some fans may object to the tune-ups/noodling between songs, so to each his own on that subject.  As I said, for me it  adds authenticity.  Back then you pretty much expected some kind of sound problems and just went along with it knowing that it would soon be fixed.  The songs are a mix of older and more recent tunes, from songs they played early on like ""Beat It On Down The Line"",  to more recent things like ""Mexicali Blues"".  There's a nice ""Dark Star"" and a great ""The Other One>Me And My Uncle>The Other One"" among other fine performances.  The addition of Keith Godchaux seemed to energize the band during this period and they played some great gigs in '71.

Even with the sonic problems which are relatively few, this is well worth adding to your shelf of live Dead.  This era was definitely one of the best periods for live gigs and this concert is another good example.  I was lucky enough to attend college in Palo Alto (south of S.F.) in the late '60s/early '70s and heard/experienced the Dead  both outdoors for free and in various venues in the area, and this set is another good reminder of just how good this band was.  A nice way to spend 3 1/2 hours.

And check out the '77 Cornell show that Deadheads have long wished for in remastered sound, available in May.  There's an 11 disc set also available that includes Cornell.  The Harding show is also available in a 21 CD set titled ""71 Dead"".",1484352000,4

2636,840,115,"I know this has already been reviewed but I've been a Stoneground fan since somewhere in the early '70s, so I just have to say a few words about the band and this album.

Finally!  A label has reissued this great album with that live S.F. vibe to it.  I still own the original vinyl from those days and this (we called them gate-fold albums back then)  was a beautifully packed double album set with nicely done photos in the inside.  But beyond the visuals it's the music the band played that set them apart from other bands of the period.  Easily shifting from rock to blues, gospel to soul,  folk to country, and a combination of any of those genres, this band had that certain ""thing"", that vibe that marked it as a band to hear.  But sadly Stoneground never really received the notoriety they deserved.  But they did leave us with three albums from that era--this is the second (and arguably) best of the three.

With three live sides (from a KSAN-FM broadcast in '71) and one studio side, this (originally double vinyl)  album really let people know what the band was all about.  I only heard Stoneground once somewhere in the early '70s on a bill when they were a support act.  But their use of multiple vocalists combined with good (but never showy)  instrumentalists and a set list of tunes from  Johnny Cash to Mississippi John Hurt to Vanda and Young (of Easybeats fame and Young's family members later in AC/DC), to Dylan to Hank Williams, plus their own originals gave this band a real wide-ranging  identity, especially on stage.

This album will give you a good idea of what the band was like on stage.  It almost makes me want to put on one of my old tie-die shirts and relive the memories.  If you were lucky enough to have heard the band during their short life you know what I mean.  But if you're new to Stoneground this 2 CD set will give you some idea of both the band and that era of great S.F. bands.

Until now the only readily available album of their live music is ""The Last Dance Live January 6, 1973"", a single disc recorded in Sacramento, Ca.  After that the band went their separate ways due to the rigors of constant touring and little to show for it.

2653,867,1636,"This was the original cover put forward, not by Jimi (it is often stated he hated it), but by the UK label boss (Chris Stamp) who liked to push boundaries in order to get attention. Hence it was only released in the UK like this and was banned from many stores. This mini LP replica is mainly for collectors. It should also be noted that the artwork requested by Jimi himself was also rejected and now we have the famous red and yellow art photo.

I never purchased a JH Experience studio album until after his death. My only Hendrix album during his lifetime was Smash Hits which did me just fine but left me wanting more, later, after his death. ARE YOU EXPERIENCED was an amazing stoner find which I discovered only after entry into college and joining the club. Yeah, that was groovy. I gave AXIS BOLD AS LOVE a listen or two but it didn't do the thing for me. It was missing something essential. I nailed it down, what it was missing only after I heard ELECTRIC LADYLAND. THAT was what it was missing! Now ELECTRIC LADYLAND was the culmination of everything great about Jimi. Here is his masterpiece! I used to play side three (the psychedelic side) over and over and skipped side two much too often, and side four was MY favorite side so the second vinyl disc just plumb wore out! Then I sat without ANY Hendrix for a couple decades 'cept for a reissue CD of Smash Hits (again). So about 6 months ago I ran across this remastered work of art in a hold-over hippie record store, shoo'd the moths out of my wallet and have been happily eating ELECTRIC LADYLAND once again for a while now.

Now, if you are one like me, pop into the way-back machine and figure out if you grooved to melodious Beatles, Mamas & Papas, Simon & Garfunkel; or you liked to trip out with The Doors, The Airplane, The Dead; if you were adverse to screaming wailing guitar noise (as you used to think of it) but you could knock down a platter of Led Zeppelin or The Who, well maybe initially Hendrix just wasn't your bag, but you could easily dig Red House, All Along The Watchtower, Foxy Lady; yeah you were a Smash Hits kinda fan. Now you are all growed up and you are in need of a little HISTORY. So what's the Real Deal behind the mystique? Everyone says this is The Album, the Masterpiece, the Hendrix Sgt Pepper, even Rolling Stone mag bows down before it. Huh? Well, let's look-see...

Bear in mind that Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa threw pop convention out the window three years earlier and released the first ever double LPs from the pop-rock community; the double LP had basically been the providence of jazz performers like Ella who released a number of them; then Donovan released A Gift From A Flower To A Garden in a fashionable box with trinkets in '67; and Cream's Wheels Of Fire in '68. Chicago would make the trend a habit beginning in '69 and progressive rock acts would make it almost a requirement after that. My purchase of the album was after it had become fashionable, but in October of '68, Jimi had joined an elite handful of artists with great expectations. Now that fabulous double dinner treat fits on one CD but it's a full CD with a smorgasbord of sound!

Jimi likes to ask his listeners pertinent questions before he kicks off the set. In '67 it was Are You Experienced? 15 months later: Have You Ever Been To Electric Lady Land? Both albums answered the questions with amazing results, but LADYLAND simply entreats the audience to a diversity of compositional talent which is unprecedented (at least at that time): psychedelic sounds and experimental guitar works, pop, rock, and R&B confections, jazz licks and blues jams; LADYLAND is like a premiere at an art gallery. It chomps off huge chunks of varietal genre, fuses them together or lays them down against each other in odd meter and arrangement, the end result is one of the most satisfying demonstrations of crossover musicianship you will ever encounter. And when you listen to tunes like his cover of Earl King's Come On you will understand, you will perceive where the likes of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Joe Bonamassa arose from. Little Miss Strange seems almost out of place as a 60's pop-rock candy tune with Noel Redding on the mike, but pay attention to guitar layers, the wah-wah, fuzz, fills, and solos, anything but bubblegum folks! The live Voodoo Chile and its' Slight Return variant are sheer monuments in music history, and the psychedelic stretch from Rainy Day to Still Raining is one of the best guitar god runs ever laid down on tape. Let's not forget that All Along The Watchtower teams the ""voice of our generation"" with one of the greatest guitar-god icons ever, into a smoldering track that featured revolutionary guitar and bass work all laid down by Jimi himself, a song that has become a soundtrack piece defining an era and one of the greatest recordings of all time.

Young dude's: if you are wondering ""what Jimi Hendrix album should I buy?"" Can't recommend this one enough. Yes, I know, Are You Experienced is an attractive issue, being the debut and containing huge amounts of popular Hendrix trax, and it is definitely an item you should own (be sure to pick up the re-issue containing Red House which was only available on the UK release for years, Red House is one of Hendrix' best recordings as well)... but... ELECTRIC LADYLAND is Jimi's definitive masterpiece, his magnum opus, the pure art gallery of all his talent distilled into one creative Everest.",1484611200,5

This trio consists of Carnie and Wendy Wilson, daughters of Brian Wilson (Beach Boys) and Chynna Phillips, daughter of John and Michelle Phillips ( The Mamas and the Papas). In a way, this speaks for itself. They have an uncanny ability to perform their intertwining harmonies. They are one of my favorite performers. I always have been a fan of the Beach Boys and the Mamas and Papas. I just love it. The MP3 sound quality is quite acceptable.",1484611200,5

2681,874,1649,"I'm a fan of Daft Punk, but I have to admit that the first few times I heard their collaboration with Pharrell Williams, ""Get Lucky,"" I wasn't impressed.  It didn't have the same kind of electronic charm as Daft Punk's usual work, far more pop-based and with Willams overtaking their signature robotic vocals.  Much like another reviewer of this song, however, the more I listened to it, the more hooked I became.  It's a catchy song, upbeat and almost impossible not to dance along to.  I would have liked a bit more of Daft Punk's presence in this song than Williams', but that's just my personal preference.

Also, this song is VERY repetitive, and so it might drive some listeners nuts.  It doesn't bother me too much, however.  And while it might not be my favorite song by the band (I still enjoy ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" and ""One More Time"" more), it's still a good listen, a nice fusion of pop and electronica.",1484697600,4

And every time ""What It Means"" comes on, I jump around the room and pump my fist in the air. These guys are on fire!

Hood and Cooley have written some outstanding new material for this album. Listen to Patterson Hood as he sings, the heartfelt words cutting through the musical mix like sharp knives. You can't NOT be moved by these songs. The lyrics cover plenty of political territory, particularly America's continuing battles with racism.

Grand Funk was highly acclaimed by audiences nationwide, but they never got much radio play and were frequently panned by critics. I had a chance to see them live. I was mesmerized by their powerful stage presence. They kicked some butt. They did sell an awful lot of records. I bought a couple of their vinyl albums after I had seen them live.

2785,100,206,"Okay, so I must say, I like this album, but it has too many flaws to overlook.
With each review for anything, I use different styles for how product needs to be told, so for this product, This Is What The Truth Feels Like, by Gwen Stefani, I will use the What I didn't like and What I did like.
Okay, let's get started.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE

* Some of the songs, I feel ended too early. And this happened a lot, which kind of sucked, the ending could've been drug out for ten more seconds at least in a few songs. I don't know if this is just me? But it bothered my enjoyment for a big quantity of the album.
* Some of the lyrics became repetitive. Sometimes, it almost just felt like a written song, without something for me to get sucked into, because I couldn't ignore the repetition. This was for, from what I can remember, a little majority of the album, but still.
* The last song, Rare, was what I really liked out of thee entire thing. Before I listened to this entire album in order, as I usually do with all albums, I had already liked Misery and Where Would I Be?, You're my Favorite was good too. But otherwise, while listening to this album, those songs I liked in the past, specifically Misery and Where Would I Be?, just missed me, and the only one that really stuck out was Rare. The song Rare wasn't perfect, but it was better than most of the songs on the album.
* Also, some of the lyrics, just came off cheesy and silly at times. It has Gwen Stefani's signature flare (which I love, as I have been listened to Gwen Stefani ever since she went solo in the 2000's), but I don't know if it worked with all of the subject matter Gwen was trying to convey. I was divided, while Gwen tried to be serious, and make us feel what she was feeling, I still couldn't shake the theatrical feeling that came along with it. I just don't think the theatrical tone, that I think was supposed to back Stefani's anger for her husband's cheating, worked. It just felt like Gwen's older albums, which isn't a bad thing, but yet again, just (in my opinion) didn't fit the atmosphere of the album overall.
* At a certain part of the album, when she said that her husband had left, I felt that that was a little bit too rushed. It was like she was angry one moment, and then sad the other. I don't know how cheating feels, and I am sure that there are a lot of ups and downs, but this was just a little problem for me.
Overall, for the negative side of this album, the lyrics felt repetitive, and I felt the album could've had a lot of potential.
I am not trying to be mean. This album was very special to Gwen, but still, it felt repetitive and it felt like it could've been a lot better.
Now, for the good side of the album.

WHAT I LIKED

* Her semi-rapping (it was still good though) with Fetty Wap, whom I like out of a lot of rappers I just don't care for. Asking 4 It was a good song, and I enjoyed it.
* Her song Naughty. It had just the right theatrics, and it went along with this great, Empire-esque, beat. At least that's what it made me think of. There's this rap feeling that hovers over the album, much more heavily than Gwen Stefani's other works, and I can't say that it's a bad thing. I liked this song, because it wasn't something I was expecting. It even had this feeling of Soul to it. I don't know if ""feeling"" is the right word, I just can't think of another one.
* Misery, You're My Favorite, Where Would I Be?, Make Me Like You, Rare.

So, overall, the album could've been better. But it does have a good few tunes. I still love Gwen Stefani's music, but I am not screaming at the top of my lungs for her next album. 3 stars overall.",1484956800,3

2788,528,770,"More pop than punk. The guys are so talented that I think a bad album is literally impossible. However, this album just comes across as a money grab and play for radio time. Like another reviewer has said, every single song is geared as a single. That can get kind of tedious. Not every song is supposed to be a single, you need some breaks and transitions. Not much of a hard edge to this album at all, some songs are downright sugary. Don't get me wrong, enjoyable enough, but maybe a little too teenie-bopper. I kind of figured at this point in their career they would be transitioning into something more mature or darker, not something, well, more shallow.",1484956800,3

2795,906,1463,"Comparing ""Live at the Academy"" box set (more in depth/lengthy reissue of the 1971 ""Rock of Ages"") with this ""Last Waltz"" really shows how completely superior the 1971 shows are. Even though ""The Last Waltz"" gets ton of publicity for all of its pomp; Scocesy Direction and Star Studded guest list, ""Live at the Academy"" shows the band still hungry and fresh, full of energy and inspiration. Even though, they were already going into dark places with 3 of the members trying out ""White China"" heroin and already Richard Manuel's drinking taking on new levels of seriousness, they still got it together for these shows and were able to put out a couple of really good releases.",1484956800,3

2825,887,1707,"This album is one of my favorite recent discoveries. I never heard Karl Blau before, but then I started reading about him and this album in various magazines and online, and then heard his version of Tom T. Hall's ""That's How I Got To Memphis"" and was instantly smitten by his warm, melodic voice. One of those voices that commands your immediate attention. I promptly ordered this album from Amazon and am now even more enamored. This is fabulous music!

First thing to know; there is no original material on this album. It's comprised entirely of cover versions, most of them classic country or folk tunes like ""That's How I Got to Memphis"", ""Homecoming"" (another fine Tom T. Hall song), Townes Van Zandt's ""If I Needed You"", Tom Rush's ""No Regrets"", and two songs that Waylon Jenniings will know and love, ""Six White Horses"" and ""Dreaming My Dreams."" Throw in a cover of the Bee Gees' ""To Love Somebody"", Gary Paxton's ""Woman (Sensuous Woman)"", and a few more tunes and you a nearly perfect album.

Song after song, I keep thinking; this is wonderful! It's a seamless blend of truly timeless songs, all of them punctuated by Blau's emotionally powerful voice. The liner notes by Tucker Martine call Blau a ""powerful interpreter of songs"" and that's an understatement. Blau obviously took great care in picking just the right songs to cover, but it's also fair to say this his versions of some, if not most, of these song are the best ones ever recorded. Really, this guy is that good! Even if you are hesitant to buy something categorized as ""country"" give this album a chance. Simply one of the best albums I've heard in the past year.",1485043200,5

I have always loved being able to listen to small pieces of a track and and how when listening to a certain category of music other suggestions were offered. In that way I was able to discover new genres of music and new artists I would not have known about. Already earlier Amazon made some changes I did not like either. For example, one used to be able to scroll down quickly while reading or playing a game to check what track was exactly playing. Why on earth would they change that. I do not want to pay a monthly fee and feel I may now have to look elsewhere for finding interesting music. Not only that, some of Amazon's streaming music had glitches, sort of hiccups.

2929,954,1749,"Margaret Glaspy is a New York-based guitarist-singer-songwriter. She released a couple of promising EPs several years ago, and finally released this, her full-length debut album in 2016. If you are not familiar with Glaspy's sound, think early-Liz Phair, although Glaspy's influences are far and wide (from Joni Mitchell to Weezer).

""Emotions and Math"" (12 tracks; 34 min.) opens with the title track, and the song sets the tone for the entire album: rough-around-the-edges lead guitar from Glaspy, accompanied by drums and bass, and that's it. But don't call it a minimalist sound. Glaspy's warm vocals shine in this song, and indeed the entire album. In ""Situation"", Glaspy croons ""Take your hands off of me/There's nothing wrong with me/I don't like sympathy/Don't you dare pity me"", wow. ""You and I"" (1st single) is about as catchy as anything on here, and of course sporting smart lyrics (""I'm not looking for an open door to talk about love/Maybe you agree but I see you saving pictures of/You and I/I don't want to see you crying but it looks like a matter of time"", ha!). ""Somebody to Anybody"" is the first of a couple of songs where it's just Glaspy and her guitar. ""Memory Street"" is outright bluesy. Side B opens with a rollicking ""Pins and Needles"". ""Parental Guidance"" is a biting look back at early school years (""Make friends with kiddies you can't relate to/And play it cool in the school yard so that nobody hates you""). ""Love Like This"" is my absolute favorite track on here, with Glaspy's hard guitar licks while singing (with vented anger) ""People lie, cheat, kill for love like this/Few have known, seen, felt a love like this"". The album closes with ""Black is Blue"", another standout song. All of the songs are in the 2 to 3 min. range and this album clips by in no time. My daughter, who knows my music taste quite well, got this CD for me last month as a Christmas gift, and I have been playing this relentlessly.

By pure chance, Margaret Claspy is coming to Cincinnati next week (opening for the Lumineers) and I cannot wait to hear how these songs will resonate in a live setting (in a 15,000 seat arena no less). Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for indie music with a biting undercurrent, please give this album a try. I am quite certain you will enjoy it quite a bit. ""Emotions and Math"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

*UPDATE* I saw her in concert, and she and her band (drummer and bassist) put on a great 30 min. set, opening with ""Love Like This"" (as mentioned, my favorite track of the album), and closing with the title track. In between she obviously played mostly from the album, but she also brought a new track (she didn't mention the title) that was perhaps the best of the whole set, with a great guitar solo going straight into a long instrumental outro, wow. Can't wait to see where Glasky is going next. Meanwhile, if you have a chance to see her live, do not miss her!",1485302400,4

2946,292,1756,"The movie ""Honeysuckle Rose"" wasn't I believe very popular when it came out but I always thought it was better then most people give it credit for. And as for the soundtrack album it is fantastic. I rate it one of Willie Nelson's best albums if not his best. What I like best about the album was it is all live music and Willie is one of those performers who always sounds better in person then on a recording. Of all the songs from this soundtrack the best of them all as far as I am concerned is ""Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground"". A sentimentally sad melancholic song with touching lyrics to it Willie is at his best while singing it. Willie has had a slew of hit songs during his career. And many are probably more well known then this song but for me this is his all time best performance. Give this a listen and see for yourself.",1485388800,5

Also, the musical style differed from typical Ocasek new wave.  It turned out to be their biggest international hit. I liked the song a lot, but I never bought the album.

The singer Klaus Meine, member of the original line-up, did an outstanding job presenting this power ballad. The song achieved major recognition world wide. It was one of the best selling singles of all times. It was the best selling single performed by a German artist. It peaked at #4 on the US chart in August of 1991. It was not the only power ballad performed by the Scorpions. This song and their other ballads are on the list of my all-time favorites. It is a must have. It is the greatest Heavy Metal Ballad.

The Pretty Reckless now have 3 albums and I listened to the 2nd one first. I don't recall hearing any singles form ""Light Me Up"" but who doesn't remember ""Follow Me Down"" and :Heaven Knows"".
As a 1st album this is really pretty good. Musically this isn't very experimental or pregressive. It's a standard rock set. What makes this special then is Taylor Momsen's voice and the lyrics. The lyrics tell a dark tale of drugs, alcohol, sex and sexual abuse. So even though the music is modern-rock conservative it will build an audience. So as the audience builder album it works well and act as a gateway to the more populist ""Going to Hell"". The two best songs are ""The Walls are closing in/hangman"" and ""Mad love"".

3084,570,144,"The Chainsmokers are, apparently, an American DJ duo. Hey ho, who cares. Don't let me down was their first top five single and features the voice of Daya. Really it is Daya that makes this her success. Her voice has great reach and doesn't feel strained at any point. Lyrically this is simple but as a whole the song works very well. Not the greatest treadmill tune but a good listen anyway.",1485648000,4

If you have been looking to download ""Bolero"" to add to your classical music collection you can't get much better then this. Some people don't like ""Bolero"" and complain that the song just keeps repeating itself going over and over again with the same melody. But the beauty of this song is how as the song keeps playing over and over the same thing it very slowly builds up in intensity. Starting out so softly you have to listen carefully for the opening. By the ending the orchestra is at full volume at its dramatic glory all the while still playing at the same tempo. It is definitely a piece I never grow tired of listening to.

3216,0,1582,"Quarterflash was formed in Oregon in 1980. The singer and sax player is Rindy Ross, wife of Marv Ross, guitarist. What makes this band different is the fact that the front vocalist also plays the saxophone. Rindy stated at one time that she uses the saxophone as an extension of her voice enabling her to put more feeling and emotion to a given song which her voice alone, in her opinion, would not be able to achieve. The self-titled album was released in the latter part of 1981. Almost a year later it went Platinum, meaning more than a Million copies sold. This song is performed impeccably, very well arranged and executed. It is a true classic of the '80s. I like this song very much. Their other songs are not bad either, but this is the tune that put Quarterflash to a #7 slot in the charts. The MP3 sound quality is better than what I had expected.",1485907200,5

It was first released as a single before the entire album was finished. A discerning ear can detect some differences between the single and the album version. In my opinion, the differences are insignificant. Their music is very peppy and uplifting. It makes you wanna get up and dance your legs off. I did, back then. Now I'm old and less agile. But when I hear that song my humble gait seems to go through some sort of rejuvenation. I need to listen to it more often. I just love it.

I bought the vinyl album back then and played it frequently using high end turntables connected to an audiophile grade system. Years later, I switched to high end CD players and improved analog system technology. I briefly owned the virtual Red Book CD. It sounded just as good as the vinyl, actually cleaner and with improved dynamic range. The MP3 sound quality of this version is amazingly good for this type of format.

3350,0,1910,"This song is part of the self-titled album released by this British group in 1982. Their musical style is best described as New Wave and Synth Pop. It is well performed and peppy. I remember it fondly from seeing and hearing the video on MTV. I read most all of the other reviews. The album cover art is the original design. There appears to be some dispute about the originality and quality of the recording. I have to say that the MP3 sound quality leaves a bit to be desired, which is why I give this only a 4-Star rating. Otherwise, I like the song, even though synth pop and new wave are not my favorite genres. However, this band performs their material very well.

He did get many awards and recognitions. Even while he spent time with Uncle Sam (Far East) he would not cease to entertain. He formed a band and played for the troops. He was born in Mississippi but moved to Arkansas when he was only 10 years old. His actual name is Harold Jenkins. It was determined that he needed a stage name with more ring to it. At one time, he was looking at a road map where he saw at town called Conway in Arkansas and a town in Texas called Twitty. Hence, that was his name from thereon in. This particular song is one of my favorites. This is pure Conway. It is an iconic classic. I have always loved it.

This song was covered by 'Guns N' Roses' and 'The Raign', for example. Those versions are not too bad but do not stand a comparison.

3364,874,708,"I normally don't listen to a lot of modern music, but something about Gotye's hit ""Somebody That I Used To Know"" appealed to me in a strange way.  Perhaps it's the music, which seems to heavily feature xylophone (not necessarily an instrument used in most pop music) and lacks a lot of electronic sound.  Perhaps it's the hypnotic beat and mellow tempo, which while not slow isn't necessarily upbeat either.  Or perhaps it's simply the vocals, which give us a haunting ballad about a failed relationship that a LOT of people can probably relate to.

At any rate, this is an oddly compelling and addictive song, and well worth a listen.  It's quite a departure from most contemporary music, and in this case it's a fantastic thing to find something a little different from the norm.",1486166400,4

3379,1078,1920,"Chelsea Grin don't give a f***. Don't believe me? Pick up the lyric sheet for Self Inflicted and...well..it's pretty obvious given the superfluous number of times that claim is made.

Before the hate rolls in, I LOVE Chelsea Grin. From Desolation to Damnation, Evolve to Ashes, the band has proved time and time again they have the chops and rhythmic sensibily to create some exceptionally brutal deathcore. But Self Inflicted is another beast entirely, focusing more on rhythm than any of their other releases.

That fact is what really brings this album down. Sure there are a few really good bangers here (Scratching & Screaming, Broken Bonds, Skin Deep), but the majority of the LP sinks under uninspired chugging and remarkably awful lyrics (Love Song and Clickbait have some real groaners). It's as if CG decided to mash up the styles of early Carnifex and Attila without the former's technical flair and the latter's toungue-poking-through-their-cheeks lyrical bent.

I really wanted to like this more, but a spade is a spade. And a mediocre album is just that. Mediocre. Those who want straight bangers without all that ""riffing"" nonsense will find plenty to love here. Anyone else would be better off delving further back into the band's discography.

3450,15,1953,"Katy Perry finally came into her own as a singer/songwriter with ""Prism"". ""One of the Boys"" and ""Teenage Dream"" were decent pop records, but I always thought they were too poppy and commercial. On ""Prism"", there's still a handful of glossy pop gems, but there's darker undertones which shows Katy in a different and exciting light. It's funny that the first single, ""Roar"" is the only song that doesn't work. It's a safe and predictable song. Doesn't show much growth. But the album REALLY comes alive with the next track, ""Legendary Lovers"". Wow. One of my favorites here. Love the sitar and catchy chorus. This song will get stuck in your head for sure. ""Birthday"" is fun but not silly. I really enjoy it. It has some flavor to it. ""Walking on Air"" is an ode to '90s House music. I really like this song, probably because I liked this genre of music growing up. Has a great rhythm and flow. ""Unconditionally"" is the first of the ballads. It really shows how strong Katy's voice has gotten over the years. She belts her little heart out. Beautiful and sentimental. ""Dark Horse"" reminds me of ""E.T"" from ""Teenage Dream"". ""Dark Horse"" has a good beat but the rap by Juicy J is pretty bad. Next! ""This is How We Do"" is awesome. I love Katy's wicked sense of humor. ""International Smile"" is a tad corny but it's cute. It's sunny, bright, and very girly. ""Ghost"" is when the darker elements of ""Prism"" start to surface. It's pretty obvious ""Ghost"" is about her failed marriage to Russell Brand. Katy doesn't mince words on this track. She lets herself be vulnerable and raw. This song is special. I love it. ""Love Me"" and ""This Moment"" are very important tracks about self-acceptance and finding balance. Katy's vocals on these 2 songs reminds me of Kelly Clarkson. Again, excellent dark songs. Katy really digs deep here. ""Double Rainbow"" is a superb album cut. Took until the second listen until I realized how poetic this song really is. And finally the song that gets me teary-eyed and gives me chills, ""By the Grace of God"". Her most personal song to date. Her vocals are once again flawless and powerful. The lyrics are just...WOW. She doesn't hold back. This is my first Katy Perry album that I've given 5 stars. This album was not as successful as her last 2 but that doesn't mean it's not good or memorable. With the exception of ""Roar"", ""Prism"" is a top-notch, well-written and well-produced record. Kudos to Katy for taking artistic risk. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1486425600,5

She like all women just need to learn to change it up and in the end you could listen to her for hours..... but as I said most songs sound almost the same and an hour of that would make me go insane......But this song is tops of tops.......One of her if not the best song she sings.,1486512000,5

3511,1116,1977,"I owned this on cassette years ago when it first came out and haven't heard it since I jettisoned everything I owned in that obsolete and unsatisfactory medium, so returning to it has been interesting. Almost everything I revisit nowadays sounds better than I had remembered it, as it seems that a generation or two ago we could afford to be pickier about the quality of singing we require; now in days of dearth with both artists gone I am inclined to be more grateful for what they brought to the recording studio.

This is, as a previous reviewer has rightly remarked, a Big Sing. Sutherland certainly sounds rather too beefy, matronly and healthy of voice for a consumptive. She brings little of Cortrubas', Caball's or Callas' delicacy to her portrayal, her vibrato has loosened somewhat, and her portrayal is generalised in comparison with more nuanced accounts, but she is in good voice; her coloratura, portamento and trill are all functioning wonderfully. She also reads Germont's letter with great feeling and dramatically makes more of her dying scene than you might have expected; the middle section of her voice in ""Addio del passato"" is really very beautiful and the famous top notes wholly intact. The husky lower register isn't so pleasing and she isn't really all that believable as our heroine but the singing per se is admirable.

Pavarotti is also mostly in Stand and Sing mode but for many that will be enough and he brings some passion and energy to his Alfredo. His tenor is in prime condition, ringing and honeyed by turns. He is still very good for Levine eleven years later but this remains his best recording. The delight of this recording for his fans will be Matteo Manuguerra's Germont; he sounds suitably grave and middle-aged and I love the slightly nasal timbre of his voice. His legato is exemplary and he thoroughly convinces as Germont pre.

I seem to be in a minority when it comes to my dislike of Sutherland's earlier recording in that I cannot abide what I hear as her persistent flatness on top notes in ""Sempre libera"" and find her mushy diction and mooning manner irksome; her words are more distinct here and she is equally well partnered. Bonynge's direction is fairly leisurely to give his big voices space but the overall effect can be rather leisurely if not soporific. The recorded sound is first rate - spacious and detailed; typical of Decca's best.",1486512000,4

They may not play the instruments but, the music is vibrant and fun and very different from their debut album which I am not a fan of. 'Metal Resistance' gives me more of a progressive tone with some very fun listens. I can personally listen to 'Karate' 50 times a day or more. The fact that Baby Metal is out of the vein of NKOTB, Backstreet Boys and N*SYNC is crazy to think because they are not pop.. However, the music has a pop element to it and that is not a bad thing because the music is very much legit.

I don't know what to expect from this trio espeically as they get older. What I am hoping for is that in the end they stick around and are given more liberties towards the album making process. As a rock fan scrounging for rock and heavy metal acts in a fabricated and pointless music world here in the United States. I am hoping that Baby Metal sparks a new Rock/Hard Rock/Heavy Metal revolution.",1486598400,5

3631,874,649,"I'm aware that ""More Than Words"" is a rather atypical hit for the band Extreme, which leans more toward the harder spectrum of music than a mellow guitar song would suggest.  That doesn't prevent me from enjoying this song, which is a melancholy but ultimately heartfelt song about asking a loved one to show their love instead of just using empty words.  It's a very simple song in its message, in the instrumentation that consists solely of a single guitar, and in the laid-back and unadorned (and un-auto-tuned) voices of the singers.  And sometimes, a simple song works nicely.",1486771200,4

This is the only MFSL pressing I give four stars.

There was actually a release on RYKODisc Vinyl in the 1990's
that matched or surpassed the sound of this MFSL release.

Either of these vinyl pressings are the best way to listen to this album.

3655,549,2029,"It is just so sad that whenever someone young and talented passes away so soon, you're really often reminded of the great talent they left behind at the soul. Al Jarreau has had so many great songs from jazz and pop that floated very brilliantly at the heart, and each time I really do hear one of his song, I really love his soulful gift at the heart. But when I do think of all of the songs that he brilliantly sung since the 70's, all I can absolutely think of is just one simple song that still ignites at the soul from television. The theme from the Bruce Willis 80's show Moonlighting, which has been enriched at the heart. The theme from Moonlighting still shows a brilliance in jazz and the engrained heart of pop culture. It is still one of those deep guilty pleasure songs that works today, just like it did back in the 80's, 90's and 2000's. Al really had a gift from the heart that swooned so many people time and time again. He will definitely be missed every time you hear the moonlight soul. He will be missed with each and every beat.

3663,469,2033,"If you listen to their older stuff, it can at times sound like a heavier Incubus with elements of Helmet and other bands of the late mid to late 90's. I feel like they've evolved past that and have a more modern sound, ready to carry them to 2020. ""Divided... Conquer"" is maybe the best song they've ever made, and it reflects the new direction. I'm very pleased with this album except for 'Radio Chorus' which sounds like someone's kid brother wrote it. Overall, a solid album though. It's up there with 'Development' and 'Recoil' for me.",1486857600,4

3782,0,2075,"This girl group from NYC started to sing together during childhood in the '50s. In 1963, after several unsuccessful attempts in the music and show business, they finally linked up with famed record producer Phil Spector. By then, the group called themselves 'The Ronettes,' named after lead singer Veronica Bennett (Ronnie) who eventually married Phil Spector, then becoming known as Ronnie Spector. This song, which is performed impeccably, turned out to be a huge hit for the Ronettes. It actually influenced artists such as Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame and Cher. Many other hits followed. 'Be My Baby' was one of my personal top favorites for the year 1963. The vocal and instrumental arrangements are outstanding. I just love this song. It is a true timeless classic.",1487203200,5
3783,1185,2076,"I was excited when I heard Real Gone Music was finally releasing this and I pre-ordered it immediately, thinking perhaps having it now on crystal-clear CD would allow me to appreciate it more than I did by playing an old vinyl copy. A curious artifact more than anything else, LOVE ME BY NAME dares to show a different side of the former Queen of the Teen Weepers, but after listening to this album a dozen times I still don't know exactly what she or producer Quincy Jones were going for here. Theres a common celestial vibe that runs through most of whats here. The title track is a strange hybrid of space-age jazz, while the hyper PARANOIA comes off as something that was cut from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW although Lesley does spit out the lyrics convincingly enough. IMMORTALITY tries to be both futuristic and retro and echoes First Class hit single BEACH BABY on the chorus. Both GIVE IT TO ME SWEET THING and CANT SEEM TO LIVE OUR GOOD TIMES DOWN suit her voice better and would not have been out of place on her prior album.",1487203200,3

Five NASCENT Stars! Of all of the hundreds of vocal versions of the Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer composition, ""Moon River"", over the years, perhaps the simplest, most effective, and affecting is the very first version which was sung by Audrey Hepburn. Strumming her guitar with violins and celeste in the background during 'the fire escape scene' with George Peppard in the movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", she nailed it vocally. And the song was in danger of being cut from the movie until Mancini and especially Hepburn fought hard to keep it in and, as they say, the rest is history: winning 2 Grammies for Song and Record of the Year, an Oscar, and enjoying great popularity ever since. Sung simply and sweetly, Hepburn is excellent in telling her believable tale about love, hope, wonder, and a river, in one pass through the lyrics. Mancini himself calls this his favorite version of the song. ""My huckleberry friend"", indeed! My Highest Recommendation. Five MEMORABLE Stars. (RCA Victor records. Steel music. 1-remastered MP3 track. Time-2:01.)",1487289600,5

Just Charlie is Charlie Wilson's fifth studio album and one of my favorites so far. This cd has a great R&B sound to it and mixes his old material from when he was a member of the gap band to the new material which is more comparable to singers like usher and Tyrese Gibson. All in all this album was mixed and produced very good, which in my opinion is what led to the album Reaching  number  19 on the Billboard top 200 charts and No. 2 on the Billboard R&B Album chart selling 57,286 copies in its first week.",1487376000,5

I did not do it for the pay. I left a job that paid me a little over $ 800.- per month versus the $ 309.- per month as a Private E-1 for a starter. Well, that is history. Yes, I did it purely for patriotic reasons. During the Nam War, my draft lottery number did not come up. Then I turned 26 and was married. At one time I mentioned to my wife that I was thinking about joining the Army for a while. She wanted no part of it. Well, then I had my chance. I served, after all, and I'm darn proud of it. I spent almost all of my time in Europe during the Cold War. We never knew when an alert would be just an exercise or the real thing. It was scary at times. Again, that's history. I love Toby's song.

This is the album version from 1992. It is very good, even though a version released in 1990 has more appeal to some folks. It doesn't really matter that much. Any of Lee's versions of this wonderful song will bring the message across. That is what really matters, I think.

3987,290,2169,"Wow! That was my first impression after taking a listen to this album that was released in April 2016. This one is a bit older but is just catching on after Sturgill was nominated for two Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year). He won one Grammy for Best Country Album. I discovered the album just this week and this album is HOT! HOT! HOT! and in my mind should have won Album of the Year but of course Adele ""25"" won, which itself is an excellent album - but ""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is far more diverse, versatile and overall a much stronger album than ""25.""

Sturgill Simpson shows bits of David Gray, Alex Clare, Van Morrison and Ronnie Milsap. He is an old soul at the young age of 38. He writes songs with the wisdom of a sailor who has sailed the seas of life for twice the amount of decades of his actual age.

""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is categorized as a country music album and has climbed to #1 on both the country music and rock music charts as well as #1 on the folk music charts. It has also reached #3 on billboard's Top 200 albums chart. This week the album re-entered the Billboard chart at #44 with a bullet.

Though categorized as a country music album it is far more versatile than simply a country album. The depth in musicianship and lyrics puts the album in a category all it's own. This is quite simply one of the most intriguing albums of the past 20 years.

This album is full of introspection, joy and great guitar and synthesizer sounds... and Sturgill wrote all the songs to boot (except the cover of Nirvana's ""In Bloom"").

The album opens with the sounds of ship's bell chiming (a sound you hear on other songs throughout the album) and the beautiful tinkling of keyboards. ""Welcome To Earth"" sounds like a refreshing ocean morning relaxing in the mist of the ocean air. Three minutes in the song turns into a surprising upbeat Motown flavored experience with horns and R&B rhythms. As a matter of fact The Dap-Kings (famous for playing behind Sharon Jones) are the credited horn section on this song and several others on the album.

The otherworldly ""Breakers Roar"" is soothingly beautiful accented with country tinged steel guitars bringing out an ethereal sound that gives the song a floating feel. This song screams David Gray but so much more in it's intensity and beauty.

""Keep It Between The Lines"" is a traditional country song that breaks out with a high-stepping brass section very reminiscent of 1979 era Ronnie Milsap. This immediately made me think of Milksop's '79 hit ""Get It Up."" The song features some hot licking slide guitar and awesome electric guitar. The rhythm section fires up the funk keeping it all in a traditional country music style.

""In Bloom"" is the only song not written by Sturgill Simpson. ""In Bloom"" was written by Kurt Cobain and was featured on the 1992 Nirvana album ""Nevermind."" Sturgill took the song and made it all his own with an intense delicate power working into a storm of emotion and a wall of sound production.

Brace For Impact (Live A Little)"" is my favorite song from the album for many reasons. I love the David Gilmour style guitar chords and the music video is eerie and amazing. Simpson sings this anthemic song with conviction and intensity like no other singer of this decade. ""Brace For Impact"" is not what you would expect to hear on a country music album. With it's pulsating electric bass opening it is a song that sounds like it could have been written for a Pink Floyd album all the while maintaining it's country music influence. ""Brace For Impact"" is a song about death and how different people react to it's inevitability. Sturgill's dark guitars and electronic synthesizer drive this song and turn it into an event in music that should not be missed.

""All Around You"" is a great 1950s blues style country song while ""Oh Sarah"" is that country song filled with hurt, pain and joy.

The album closes with one of it's strongest songs. ""Call To Arms"" starts of with the distant sound of seagulls, ship bells and bag pipes. The bag pipes add this unusual sort of ocean sound to the song - it works quite well. Quickly the song turns funky with R&B honky tonk horns that makes the song feel like something you might have heard in the explosive 1980 film ""The Blues Brothers."" Let me tell you the guitar work in this song is absolutely killer. I am a huge fan of the guitar and Sturgill ranks right up there with the best of the best. The bluesy piano parts rock this song out which at points reminds me just a little bit of Elvis Presley.

""A Sailor's Guide To Earth"" is one of those albums that has surprises around each corner. The musical texture is as diverse as it gets and best of all Sturgill Simpson is a really great singer. I highly recommend this album to anyone that is an avid fan of diversity in music.",1487894400,5

3995,1237,2172,"Not to be Captain Obvious but this album does not represent what TSFH is famous for and is not their typical ""trailer music"". However, this album is very beautiful and adds to the eclectic music of TSFH. I want to point out that Thomas Bergersen composed this entire album but it was released as a TSFH album since many of these songs were released on previous industry albums. I would not recommend buying this if you are new to TSFH as it does not represent what they are most famous for. However, I would recommend buying this if you prefer softer pieces and songs that almost sound like pop music (I think Thomas created a new genre of music with this album - ""epic pop"", listen to ""My Freedom"" and you'll see what I mean), or if you have everything else from TSFH and want more. This is definitely a must if you are a diehard TSFH fan. If you are new to TSFH I would recommend Battlecry, Vanquish, Illusions, or Sun. The former two if you want epic courageous music, and the latter two if you primarily want epic emotional/beautiful music.
Highlights of this album include: Miracles, Compass (especially the bonus track), My Freedom, Fountain of Life, Color the Sky, Breath of Cold Air, Wind Queen, Lost in Las Vegas.",1487980800,5

All I can say is I can't believe I waited so long to buy this album.
Highlights on the album: Starvation, Rada, A Place in Heaven, Promise, Femme Fetale, Homecoming, Reborn, Age of Gods, Illusions, Soulseeker.
There are no duds on this album. I would rate them all 8/10 and up.",1487980800,5

This album feels like its telling a story and boy its an enjoyable, beautiful, and epic one.
Highlights on the album: Creation of Earth, Cry (one of my favorite songs of all time), Final Frontier, Colors of Love, Empire of Angels. There are no duds on this album.",1487980800,5

4011,1240,1616,"For Twelve Reasons To Die, Ghostface Killah's tenth studio album, he combines efforts with producer Adrian Younge to tell a unique story of love and revenge. RZA narrates the album in brilliant form, and the Wu Tang flavor is very much alive all throughout the album whether it comes from RZA's narration and executive production or guest appearances from emcees such as Masta Killa, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Killa Sin and Cappadonna among others. Twelve Reasons To Die is not a very long collection of songs, but what it does offer will leave the listener tremendously satisfied. In other words, quality is more important than quantity here. The whole album is smart and nothing less than classic, hardcore Ghostface. His flow, rhymes, energy and timing are just as superb if not better than before, and he is still true to his roots.",1488067200,4
4012,1237,1076,"This is excellent epic orchestral/neo-classical music! I thoroughly enjoy listening to this album. However, I would rate several other Two Steps from Hell albums ahead of this one (including Classics 2), but that is only because other TSFH albums are so epic and amazing, not because this album is not good. This kind of music is perfect for just about anything. I enjoy listening while driving, studying, washing dishes, killing zombies, showering, etc. Two Steps from Hell has a piece for any situation or event I can think of. If you are a diehard TSFH fan, I would highly recommend buying this album asap. If you are new to TSFH or the ""epic music"" genre then I would recommend starting out with other albums from TSFH first such as Battlecry, Vanquish, or Invincible.
Highlights on the album: Nemesis, Jump!, Sons of War, Eternal Sorrow (this one is a beautiful, sad, amazing piece!), The Ancients, Ironheart, The World is Mind. There are no duds on this album.",1488067200,5
4013,1240,2177,"Though already covered extensively in rap and hip hop, the principles of knowledge, moral lessons and social activism can never become cliche as long as they are presented and packaged correctly, and as long as they are coming from an individual of character. They are at the core of the culture's goals alongside having a good time, challenging popular thought, and expressing oneself artistically and creatively. Already well experienced in the rap game, Queens, New York emcee Cormega makes effective use of his time by employing these principles in Mega Philosophy, a collaboration album with the legendary Large Professor serving as producer. Cormega is by far more mature than he has ever been. He stresses many points including achieving inner peace through questioning, keeping an open mind, persevering, and taking personal responsibility. In fact the whole album revolves around the theme of maintaining a strong mental state, which is the secret to life. Cormega's smooth flow of intelligent rhymes coupled with the Large Professor's no-frills beats make for classical hip hop listening, and the guest emcees, Redman, AZ, Styles P, Nature, Raekwon, and Black Rob, all contribute very hot, very smart verses. If Mega seems to get redundant, he is only paraphrasing, putting his lessons in other words to get through to his listeners; thus, he never gets dull. Driving his points home in a little more than thirty minutes, he is also concise with no fluff or fillers. Cormega and the Large Professor have not invented any groundbreaking formulas but instead simply combine their talents to make good, authentic hip hop for what might be one of the year's best rap albums.",1488067200,4

4040,549,662,"It has been a rough past few years for Rihanna. Musically, she has had more hits outside of her own album, Anti this past year. Her work on songs like Sledgehammer and This Is What You Came For, continue to show that her own album success firmly is not what it used to be a decade, largely because she overexposed her own brand in the way that Beyonce' Knowles had done as well. The past few years showed Rihanna doing more singles that really were not a part of what became Anti, and bigger hits than what she released from Anti, with the exception of Work. Her latest single, Love On The Brain, the fourth from Anti, shows Rihanna is trying to be more of a swooner in the way other legendary divas had shown in classic R&B like the legendary Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin showcased. But Rihanna does not make the mark well, and sadly it is not the best on what she had n ballads for her songs. She showed it better when she teamed up with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You a decade ago. Perhaps when Rihanna does more ballads, she can swoon with a broader and more brilliant appeal than what she showed here.

4043,1240,2185,"Maryland, let alone its Gaithersburg township, may not be a natural breeding ground for rap talent, but 2013 XXL Freshman, Logic, may soon be putting his locale on the map. The rapper and part time producer, who has been buzzing since his mixtape cascade began in 2010, seems to have his mind in the right place for Under Pressure, his studio debut. Executive produced by No ID and released by Def Jam and Visionary Music Group, Under Pressure boasts busy, luscious beats and a matured Logic confronting his rough past with a bright outlook on life. Logic starts the album with this positive tone and then delves into family stories and gets ambitious in the ""Soul Food"" two-parter. He covers a variety of topics throughout (girls, crime, movies, crew love, karma, etc.), but the most prominent and reoccurring of them include Logic's transition from a troubled, aimless childhood to mind- blowing music stardom and how it affects him and his family. Under Pressure's production as a whole captures several emotions and vibes, and it definitely has No ID's ambient beat making influence. A diverse array of producers including Visionary's 6ix and Logic himself supply rich electronic instruments and quick repeating hoots on more than one song. Logic proves himself a flavorful emcee, rapping at different speeds and cadences with a varying rhyme structure and awesome energy. He demonstrates multiple dimensions of creativity on tracks like ""Nikki,"" about a specific type of chemical dependency, and the title track ""Under Pressure,"" where he raps in the first person as his sister then father. The regular version of the album contains no guests but features Childish Gambino and Big Sean on two deluxe version bonus cuts. In the 12th track, ""Till The End,"" Logic recaps his rocky experiences in the music business and life in general but stays committed to keeping an optimistic attitude going forward. It is a fitting close to the album, where Logic shares his feelings and conveys again his project's chief mood. Firm, impactful and fun, Under Pressure shows a lot of promise for its author, who has a great mindset overall.",1488153600,3

4066,1240,2197,"Before producer/rapper Oddisee set his sights on blowing up Brooklyn and Arizona's Mello Music Group, he set Washington DC on fire, and before he took on our nation's capital, he was sizzling in his affluent Prince George's County, Maryland home base, all the time repping his ""P.G."" stomping grounds and his multicultural makeup. The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.

Making beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. ""Want Something Done"" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and ""Contradiction's Maze"" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds.",1488153600,3
4067,1240,2198,"In much the same way that Run The Jewels with El-P and Killer Mike joined two pretty humongous, previously unassociated rap camps for a detour into cruel punk rap songs, Czarface (Wu-Tang Clan's Inspectah Deck with Boston's 7L & Esoteric) are putting their unique spin on the genre with a personality and mike-disposition nearly identical to RTJ's. Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.

Their second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.

Despite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop.",1488153600,3
4068,1240,2199,"Aesop Rock, the man with the largest vocabulary in hip hop (or so states New York data scientist Matt Daniels), has returned with emcee Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz (who combined make up the group Hail Mary Mallon) for Bestiary, the trio's second LP. Released by Rhymesayers Entertainment, the same label that released HHM's first LP, Are You Gonna Eat That?, Bestiary contains a more digestible form of its fore- album's bizarre, complex lyricism of wacky, oddball imagery and situations. Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are unruly, aimless badasses, rapping all over the place and in all directions. With their ill rhyme styles, they explore the nature and philosophy of life and death, and their wild, artful rapping accurately mimics the chaos of the world. Taking its name from the word meaning a written account of real and fantasy animals, Bestiary contains some animal imagery but just lots of other imagery too, like art gallery-scale imagery. Despite all the craziness and a few dark undertones, there is a sense of purpose, hope and levity in Bestiary thanks to the ""fund raiser concert"" skits and their do-it-yourself subtext. Coupled with the intelligent, left field lyrics, the samples, scratches, diverse synths and hard rocking drums make Bestiary a truly eccentric specimen of underground, alternative hip hop. It marks a new level of comfort for Hail Mary Mallon that just might prove comforting to audiences as well.",1488153600,3
4069,1249,2200,"Fantastic Son album.  Septeto Santiaguero with Dominican singer Jose Alberto absolutely destroy the drums' leather with a lot of upbeat songs, which is not surprising for an album titled, ""No quiero llanto"".  What makes this album stand out is having a very tight Son group that is open to many collaborations from outside artists, including not only Cuban musicians, but also other Latinamerican veterans like Oscar D'Leon and Andy Montanez.  Again, this is unsurprising given their success with their previous album ""Vamos pa' la fiesta"", which included numerous international collaborations.

The album pays tribute to the duo ""Los Compadres"" which was started in the 40s, but this doesn't sound dated or nostalgic in the slightest.  The twist halfway through El Lunar (which I won't ruin for you) would probably have been unthinkable just even 20 years ago.",1488153600,5

4072,1240,2202,"Rapper/singer Kevin Gates might have gotten off on the stardom of his XXL Freshman Class induction for 2014, enough to build steam and plow through two mixtapes (By Any Means and Luca Brasi 2) in that year, but a heavy lesson in careful, artistic execution of projects should well be learned by the Baton Rouge, Louisiana native. Having worked with fellow Baton Rouge natives, rappers Lil Boosie (now Boosie Badazz) and Webbie, Kevin Gates has a sound and style that has no doubt been influenced by the two. A little bit of Lil Wayne essence can also be detected, at least at the opening of Luca Brasi 2, and this is no shocker. Weezy's Young Money helped manage Gates at one point but never signed him. That pleasure goes to Atlantic, who picked up Gates around early 2013. You can probably tell from the title that Luca Brasi 2 is heavy on the mafia/crime mob imagery and references. Kevin Gates paints himself as a rich, callous drug czar to mythic proportions, very much like a fairy tale or charade. The radio-friendly pop of the beats and Gates' light approach and occasional humor keep Luca Brasi 2 from drowning in the seriousness of the black market underworld on which his content speaks. DJ Drama hosts, and it's pretty long (just over an hour) but the decent trap beats and Gates' liquid stream of rhymes make Luca Brasi 2 just easy enough to endure. Technically, Gates is a swift, fluid flow-rider. His vocabulary is weak though, and his narrow interest in everything gangsta is frustrating. No where does Gates switch up his cadence and delivery pattern so this mixtape may have the unintended consequence of acting as a sleep inducer, sending listeners to slumber or other planes of thought instead of focusing on the lyrics. Guests on the album include August Alsina, Boobie Black, Rico Love, K Camp and Rich Homie Quan. Luca Brasi 2 is a poor mixtape that ultimately drones on for sixty-three minutes of gangsterism.",1488153600,1
4073,887,2203,"Another good but inconsistent album by Parquet Courts that leaves me a bit frustrated. There are times when this band sounds great, like a top notch outfit, but at other times, they slip into mediocrity and frustrate me.

Most of the other reviews give you a good gist of what this band sounds like. You can hear plenty of Velvet Underground influence, a bit of Pavement, and I also hear a healthy dose of old Dream Syndicate in some songs. Obviously, those are some very good influences. But Parquet Courts also have this maddening tendency to talk-rap in some of the songs, as if they are just too lazy to actually sing the song. The lead singer has a decent enough voice, so I don't know why they do this so often. Other than those infrequent musical hiccups, there are some powerful, riveting songs on this latest effort. I'm just waiting for this band to really show what they are capable of and give us a truly great album. This isn't quite the one.",1488153600,4
4074,1240,2204,"As a Mississippian, Def Jam artist and XXL Freshman from 2011, the King Remembered In Time, or Big K.R.I.T., has come a long way in the five years preceding his cosmic 2014 sophomore Cadillactica. Four highly regarded mixtapes of Southern flair and wisdom have done more than create a buzz for K.R.I.T., and his 2012 studio debut, Live From The Underground, secured his position as one of The Dirty's top rap prophets of the new era.

This Cadillactica LP is a full examination of god, life, love and pain from K.R.I.T.'s unique perspective in which he explores many topics. He places great weight on the love and cohesion of family when he laments about the anguish of broken, disconnected families in ""Soul Food."" Additionally, his gentlemanly side comes out in ""Pay Attention"" and ""Third Eye"" where he raps about fine, refined ladies. K.R.I.T.'s planet of abstract thought, or what he calls his Cadillactica, is a serene, confident mind state that makes obvious the name of his favorite make of town car. Cadillac imagery pops up in ""Cadillactica"" and the allegorical ""Do You Love Me For Real"" about the love that a man has for his woman and his ride. Toward the end of the album, he gets critical of music industry trends and encourages having an open mind. At various points, K.R.I.T. takes the liberty of jumping around with subject matter but remains logical and makes everything come together as relatable under the same roof. He has a refreshing fighting spirit of hopefulness that appropriately remedies the sadness and adversity in his surroundings. At the same time he is exceptionally lyrical, poetic and metaphorical with his swaggering flow. Because of his brainy, philosophical rumination, one might think the man too soft, but the moments where he gets tough and vicious instantly invalidate that idea.

Big K.R.I.T. has produced some of the album, but he has also invited several other producers to give Cadillactica a very original musical vibe. Perhaps not as sample heavy as some of his mixtapes, Cadillactica contains fresh synths, throwback loops, an 808-style bass line or two, and other funky instruments like the jazzy, muted trumpet in ""Mo Better Cool,"" which also contains hip, danceable, drum taps. All the sounds light up the album like stars in a night sky. Several talented singers and rappers contribute verses but never asphyxiate K.R.I.T.'s artistic expression.

Cadillactica is a colorful, comprehensive mosaic of musical influences. It's not hard to identify the different rappers who K.R.I.T. has drawn from for his style, but rest assured, his is a unique, one of a kind style that can hold up on its own. As the title to the seventh track suggests, K.R.I.T. is a rising king of the South who is giving other South stars like T.I. and Lil Wayne a run for the money. His talent and exuberance in Cadillactica make for an album that will have a special place in the hearts of fans ""4eva.""",1488153600,4

I just couldn't remember the last time I was happy.  This record helped me through it. You can hear the pain the hatred the self loathing  in Joel's voice.

4085,1240,2212,"When Philly native, college business major, writer, actor, and visual artist David Burd took the plunge into hip hop, he was rewarded for his passion. Taking the sobriquet Lil Dicky, Burd matched his tongue in cheek rap songs about his everyday life to finely directed videos and found quick fame upon sharing them online. Under CMSN and David Burd Music, Professional Rapper, Dicky's studio debut, is no short order (an hour and a half run time in fact) of his highly lyrical comedy rap decorated by poetic small talk and flippant, ordinary comments. With grandstand hip hop production and interludes filled with random, Seinfeld-like chitter chatter, Professional Rapper is fun and funny with all the markings of young adulthood and is sure of its path without taking itself too serious. Lil Dicky has arrived at the majors.

David Burd, a product of the upper middle class, doesn't come from the ghetto. That much is certain. So what that leaves is studies on love, relationships, friendship, the workplace, and anything else that people of privilege occupy themselves with. Though he is a hip hop comedian, Lil Dicky does get philosophical here (""The Antagonist,"" one of the few intense moments, is a good example), and his song studying change ""Work (Paid For That?)"" shows Dicky is a pondering man's rapper. A particular group of songs on Professional Rapper though are important to note above the others.

The very ""Professional Rapper"" song was a wise choice for the second track/first actual song (""Meet The Burds"" is actually an interlude, or ""intro-lude"" if you like). In it, Snoop Dogg interviews Dicky for a rapper job, and it's simply a terrific interchange between them where the unique concept and sharp beat push them and their performance quality to excellence. ""Lemme Freak"" is the story of a couple (in this case Dicky and his girl) growing old together and Dicky's requests for sex through the years. Again, this original concept is followed through magnificently and the dialogue exchange between the characters with its exceptionally witty banter is just stupendous. Keeping with the romance/intimacy theme, ""Personality"" is important in that it stresses the role of individual identity and dignity in dating and meeting girls, and ""Pillow Talking,"" another two-way conversation song, explores the subtle dynamics of bedroom talk. Lastly, the angsty, scornful ""Antagonist"" briefly takes on this country's race and class issues.

Lil Dicky brings to rap a different perspective on life and a fresh approach to song-writing and song-making, or basically what amount to Professional Rapper's greatest strengths. With an LP as long as Professional Rapper, there's bound to be filler, and there is but not a lot here shockingly. He has put so much in the album possibly in the hopes that listeners see the lesser parts as a smaller issue, and he carries on a bit much funneling most of his creativity into close- knit lyrical powwows. Some of the songs are probably better experienced by watching their videos because Dicky is as good a visual artist as a vocal one. Guests besides Snoop include Brendon Urie of Panic at the Disco, Hannibal Buress, Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan, Jace of Two-9, T-Pain and Brain. Professional Rapper, a solid studio-start for Lil Dicky's rap career, is a true-to-self statement that is funnier than expected since in a way Dicky has set out to be funny on the album.",1488240000,3

4165,153,2235,"Let me lay the backstory on you first, and Ill begin with the albums title Wednesday Morning, 3AM, debuting in 1964, coming from the fact that on a Wednesday night, our dashing duo had just finished their last song at 3AM in a Greenwich Village folk club, and were homeward bound to their digs in Queens  or perhaps it all had to do with the song Wednesday Morning, 3AM.  Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.

Its not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.

The release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers / Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.

Im trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.

I usually like to check out the original version of a song when I hear a cover, and as much as I like Boye, I found Adele's to be fantastic -- a melancholy but powerful ballad about a broken heart and a regretful lover, with an understated but moody musical accompaniment that lets Adele's majestic vocals.  Though I must admit I was a little disappointed to hear such a magnificent song, only to actually listen to the lyrics and discover it was yet another breakup song... there are more topics for songs than love and breaking up, folks...

Five SCINTILLATING Stars. In 1963, multiple Academy Award and multiple Grammy award-winning composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader Henry Mancini composed the triple-Grammy winning and Academy Award-nominated ""The Pink Panther Theme"" for the eponymously-entitled comedic-heist motion picture co-written and directed by long-time Mancini associate Blake Edwards. The music was coordinated with the movement of the animated pink panther cartoon character in the opening credits and has been used in some of the 11 follow-on Pink Panther movies over 30 years. It is so closely associated with Peter Sellers who starred as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, though he only starred in about four of the movies.

The memorable Mancini musical theme was played by an orchestra made up of many of the same studio musicians associated with some of Mancini's greatest musical triumphs such as ""Peter Gunn"" and ""Mr Lucky"". Plas Johnson plays the widely-acclaimed tenor sax solo which conveys elegance, hipness, and musical buoyancy in a memorable performance. In addition, other Mancini stalwarts include Pete Candoli on trumpet, Dick Nash on trombone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Shelly Manne on drums, Larry Bunker on vibes, Bob Bain on guitar, and Ted Nash and Ronny Lang on saxophones. The thrill of the performance beyond Johnson's key tenor sax role in stating the theme and performing the solo, include hot unison saxophone section riffs, the unison flute theme statement, unison trumpet section splashes, and key off-kilter pauses that add to the ambiance.

I've been a Tom Petty fan since the very first album, and even though this is not a proper Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers album, or even a Petty solo effort, I'd rank this among the best things he's ever done. Really, this is that strong an impressive a batch of songs.

The first Mudcrutch album was very good, but I think this one is even stronger. As another reviewer noted, there is indeed a Travelling Wilbury-esque vibe to many of these songs. Petty and his band sound looser, more confident, and more assured. It truly sounds like they are having lots of fun and that sense of joy permeates every one of these songs. Getting better with age?

The mp3 song version that I am reviewing has an image of what looks to be a military officer being embraced by a female (my husband showed me the shoulderboard clue).

4379,1324,2309,"Generally judged as one of the better psychedelic revival bands, Temples tosses its debut in the ring.  Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails.",1489363200,4

The best of his best to me has to be ""Born To Run"". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the ""Boss"" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song. That to me is what makes this song so good. If there is only one Bruce Springsteen song you could download on to your MP3 player this would be that song.",1489449600,5

4447,617,2330,"It seems strange now with the hindsight of 46 years distance that 1971's hugely articulate ""Muswell Hillbillies"" by THE KINKS was such a commercial dog. Their newest platter and first with RCA Records was released November 1971 on both sides of the pond - but barely managed a No. 100 placing in the US LP charts with a big fat zilch in the UK.

But then again 1970's ""Lola Versus Powerman..."" and 1971's Soundtrack to ""Percy"" (both on Pye) hadnt bothered British LP charts either. In fact - excepting obvious crowd-pleasing hit singles between the LPs like ""Lola"" and ""Apeman"" and despite the musical-excellence of what Raymond Douglas Davies & Co. was collectively producing - the public seemed utterly indifferent  especially in their native Blighty. I can recall this album being in bargain bins for decades. Commercially this most British of bands were adrift in arguably their most creative period...

And that's where this rather excellent 2014 'Legacy Edition' 2-Disc reissue of ""Muswell Hillbillies"" comes in - determined to get us all to see the error of our fatuous ways. Armed with nine Bonus Tracks and a new DVD of period recordings on Disc 2 (all restored) - here are the cups of tea and pints of beer in the Archway Tavern...

UK released 19 December 2014 (10 November 2014 in the USA) - ""Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition"" by THE KINKS on RCA/Legacy 88843093772 (Barcode 888430937727) is a 2-Disc Reissue and Remaster [1CD + 1DVD] that plays out as follows:

What the track list on the rear cover of this Legacy 2-Disc issue doesn't advise is that there's more footage on the DVD in-between tracks than is listed above. ""The Virgin Soldier March"" section includes the whole of the (rather rough) opening credits to the 1969 John Dexter movie ""The Virgin Soldiers"" starring Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett, Nigel Davenport, Nigel Patrick and an uncredited David Bowie as a soldier (Wayne Sleep is credited). It features Ray's music playing throughout with the Mike Cotton Sound being the brass band accompanying him. There is also a short interview with Carl Foreman (clearly a fan of Ray Davies and his articulate writing) discussing how Ray's incendiary British lyrics were re-written/softened by the American studios so as not to offend or illicit riots in Washington (marches that didn't materialise). There is also interviews with the clearly bemused/amused owner of the grimy Archway Tavern Pub in North London and patrons supping pints being asked how they feel now that they've been immortalised on the gatefold album cover (cue more laughter). The Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble are also introduced by Davies to the live audience at The Rainbow and play with The Kinks on three tracks -  ""She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina"", ""Alcohol"" and ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"".

The three-way foldout digipak offers a new period photo on the left flap with tape boxes pictured beneath each CD and its see-through tray. The 28-page colour booklet is a pleasingly well-endowed affair - pictures of Ray alongside black and whites/colours of the decidedly longhaired five-piece band. The booklet's front and back cover reproduce that photo where the 'Cats On Holiday' shop is all but obliterated by aluminium sheeting. The four-leaf foldout display of centre pages shows foreign picture sleeves for ""20th Century Man"" (Japan) and sheet music to ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" as well as trade adverts and reviews - it even has a 26 June 1972 ticket stub for the Free Trade Hall in Manchester with Steve Goodman as the support act. IRA ROBBINS of New York provides the very entertaining and well-written liner notes - examining the album's themes of Her Majesty's Government interference in normal people's lives - inner city alienation - people in red coming to take him away - all of this working-class British angst wrapped up in American imagery of Shirley Jones, Errol Flynn and Doris Day.

ANDREW SANDOVAL - who handled all of the Universal 'Deluxe Editions' for The Kinks Pye years - is the Project co-ordinator once again. But the big news is a new Remaster - the first generation tapes transferred by RICHARD WHITTAKER at FX Mastering in London and the Remastering carried out by the vastly experienced VIC ANESINI at Battery Studios in New York. Anesini is a name I actively seek out - he's sprinkled his knob-twiddling fairy dust magic on the catalogues of Elvis Presley, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds, Nilsson, Santana, The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mountain, Carole King and many more. This album was always a muddy mess to me - compounded by that 'Flexi' vinyl crap RCA engaged in at the beginning of the decade. There are hissy moments still on this remastered CD (the acoustic beginning of ""Holiday"" is just one of them) - but those slide guitars on ""Holloway Jail"" and the barroom piano on ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" now have more oomph for damn sure. That drum and guitar intro to ""Skin And Bone"" has fantastic punch all of a sudden - and there are other moments too. A good job done that's allowed the LP to breathe anew...

As Ray sings ""...I was born in a welfare state...ruled by bureaucracy...controlled by civil servants...and people dressed in grey..."" on the brilliant opener ""20th Century Man"" - you gather our Douglas is concerned once again for England's no-longer green and pleasant land and especially its increasingly homogenised and divided populace. Many critics commented on the depth of the song themes and lyrics (there's a lot of them) and their social commentary and insight  but it didn't seem to move the buying public in the same way. Just after the albums release - RCA put the song ""20th Century Man"" out as a US 45 in December 1971 (RCA Victor 74-0620) with the equally hard-hitting social consciousness of ""Skin And Bone"" on the B-side. But despite the lyrical/musical strengths of both sides - there were few takers. RCA Britain didn't even bother to support the album with a 7"" single - their first UK 45 on RCA Victor being the new ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" in May 1972  which in itself acted as an advance promotion for the ""Everybody's In Show Biz"" double in August.

The hippy dream is dead and nailed to the wall in the brilliant ""Alcohol"" where some floozy has fleeced a heartbroken sucker - and The Kinks begin to sound awfully like Lindisfarne's ""Fog On The Tyne"" on ""Complicated Life"" (the accordion and guitars are clearer). You also notice how well he's integrated the Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble into ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" and ""Holloway Jail"". I never was a fan of the 'Hallelujah Rosie Lea' cod nostalgia of ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" - but I'm loving the slide acoustic guitars of ""Uncle Son"" where The Kinks sound like Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance three years before the event. Recorded 17 October 1971 at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London - the album finisher and title track ""Muswell Hillbillies"" could easily be one of those Rolling Stones Country-Rock jaunts they throw so effectively into the Blues-Rock mix of their albums (""Let It Bleed"" and ""Sticky Fingers"" jump to mind).

And as ridiculously good outtakes - you'd have to call ""Lavender Lane"" (a sort of acoustic ""Waterloo Sunset""), ""Mountain Woman"" and the superb piano pain of ""Kentucky Moon"" - more evidence of the album's greatness (even the rejects were hitting the mark). The 50-second Radio Spot advert tells of ""Album of The Year"" from many American publications - but the public itself thought otherwise. It's also nice to see the Old Grey Whistle Test and Rainbow footage so clean - and dig those credits to ""The Virgin Soldiers"" movie from 1969 with Raymond Douglas Davies credited for the music (his full name used).

I'd admit that the hiss levels on some tracks are disappointing - but as I re-listen to this excellent remaster - I'm digging it more and more and my admiration for the LP has gone through the roof. Fans apparently magic-markered their song requests onto paper plates at gigs - flinging them stage-ward as the Band played. Flick your schizophrenic paper plates this way and hope for a reply...",1489622400,5

4459,1348,148,"I usually do not write a review for a single song, but this one I will make an exception because of every time I hear this song I cant stop moving in my chair. Can't Stop the Feeling! is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake for the soundtrack to the film Trolls, for which he serves as the executive music producer. This song was released in May 2016 on the RCA Records label. It is an up-tempo disco-pop, soul-pop number with funk influences.  In fact believe it or not, I have not heard of this song till the 2017 Oscars when he performed this as the opening number, since then I cant help listening to this song over and over.

The lyrics may, to some, be juvenile, but to an old head like me, they were real, honest & relateable.  Not only did this man come back, but he came back WITH A VENGENCE!

I so wanted to like this album, but it was not to be.  While I applaud the musicianship, the songs are just plain strange and do not appeal to me.  He is such a versatile and talented artist, this collection simply does not do him justice...",1490572800,1

4684,874,2412,"I first heard this song on a mix CD created by a friend of our family, simply dubbed ""Relaxing Music.""  Of all the songs on that CD, this one stuck out the most.  It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.

I've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future.",1490659200,5

The beats here are smokey and acidic, a combination of A$AP Rocky's weed-rap and the growing influence of Trap, all played to maximum effect and stylishness. Rae's voice is smooth with a slight slur, adding to the druggy atmosphere as his velvety flows slink through the rhythms. His voice is an instrument in and of itself, utilizing falsetto in intriguing ways and almost barking some of the best boasts on here (I coulda went to school to be a doctor/but I dropped out & chose to be a baller). The stuff is fire.

It's near ruined and unlistenable in comparison to the original. Punch-you-in-the-face, loudness. The mix is totally flat, the cymbals and hat are trashed. Just garbage. The only thing this has going for it is that is sound like what the album would have if Kurt has destroyed it along with his on-stage guitars... fitting maybe.",1491264000,2

This song reminds me of the loss in my life, particularly, the loss of my mother five years ago. Although intended for the loss of a lover, listen again with the lose of a loved one, and you'll understand. Labrinth's youthfulness betrays his depth of understanding. He has wisdom well beyond his years. His soulful, heartfelt message and song is pure, simple, and true. Never has my spirit soared so high, or sank so low at the loss in my life. This world was never meant for someone as beautiful as those we loved and lost.",1491350400,5

4884,318,2464,"Corinne, to me, followed the trail of The Weeknd.  First releases, I loved.  Second releases, I LOVED!!!  There was something about this release that made me notice her now.  She still has that haunting, soft, strong voice that propelled her, but her music seems to have stepped up a knotch. You have the ballads and....do I hear a little crunk on some tracks?  Sure did.  She still shutting it down with lyrics that float/plunge into the deep waters to the point that you have to REALLY LISTEN to what she's singing or reading the insert and taking it from there.  Songs are being alternated as to which one I love the most on that day.  So far, DO YOU THINK OF ME & HORSE PRINT DRESS have tied for first place.  The other songs are first and a half.  Corrine took a lot of time off to come back and deliver a masterpiece of inside the heart and the joys and heartbreak that it could bring and I'm glad that I came along for the ride.",1491436800,5

4948,623,2491,"John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band have been playing here in the Rhode Island area and around the Northeast for decades. In fact they are still at it. The group finally struck pay dirt in 1984 with a tune called ""On The Dark Side"" from the motion picture ""Eddie and the Cruisers"".  At long last this talented and hard-working outfit had themselves a major national hit. The single was originally released on the Scotti Brothers label in October 1983.  Listing the artist as ""Eddie and The Cruisers"" the song spent a total of 9 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart peaking at a rather lackluster #64.  But ""Eddie and The Cruisers"" would become something of a cult classic.  The record label saw fit to re-release the single In August of 1984.  Now the label credited ""John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band"" as being the artist.  The record got a ton of airplay and this time around the tune spent 18 weeks on the national charts peaking at #7.  What a terrific rock and roll record!  One of the best singles of the 1980's.",1491868800,5

4955,1473,2495,"Animal + Cannibal is a repacked edition of her debut album ""Animal"" and its follow-up the EP ""Cannibal"". Kesha is very similar to her peer Lady Gaga, the two of whom debuted at the same time; the music is pretty much the same so if you love Lady Gaga you'll definitely love Kesha. The difference between her and Lady Gaga is that Kesha's style is harder, she's the ultimate party girl, and she on a mission here to party non-stop. The songs are primarily dance tracks, with slightly harsh electronic (I think its electroclash not to sure on the sub-genre), but surprising it suits her voice, Dr. Luke and his cohorts did a wonderfully job with production despite the harsh electronic background that surrounds her, Kesha doesn't get lost in the mix and its her that stand in the forefront. Most of the tracks (the really goods ones) revolve around drinking, party, and boys. But please don't think for a minute that she is just another puppet most of it is written or co-written by her and she can actually sing. (Something she better demonstrates on Deconstructed). My favorites from ""Animal"" are Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Tik Tok, Kiss N Tell, Your Love is My Drug, and Take it Off. From ""Cannibal"" are Grow a Pear, Sleazy, and Crazy Beautiful Life",1491868800,5

I have since purchased the CD outright, but if you are a casual Joe Walsh fan and want his absolute best classic tracks, this Life's Been Good is a must have for your collection!  It is deceptively simple, deceptively because the guitar work is highly complex behind that initial basic chord progression, and the song structure is progressive rock with time signature changes in abundance.  Take a ride on this rollicking fun house classic which is full of humor and has the Eagles backing Joe on instrumental jams.  Sound engineering on the remaster is perfection!",1491955200,5

4974,623,2500,"He was a powerful force on the Billboard charts for more than a quarter century. Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a splendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot. His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60's, 70's and 80's. Yes, Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original.

During the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit ""Fingertips - Pt 2"" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! ""Little Stevie Wonder"" was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. During the 1960's Wonder would go on to have nearly two dozen charted singles including the rollicking ""I Was Made To Love Her"", ""Uptight (Everything's Alright)"" and the beautiful love song ""My Cherie Amour"" in 1969.

For all of the success he enjoyed in the 1960's Stevie Wonder would go on to even bigger and better things during the 1970's.  Stevie was definitely on a roll and five of his singles would make all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  In the fall of 1976 Stevie Wonder released his masterpiece, the 2 LP set ""Songs In The Key Of Life"".  The album was an immediate smash debuting at #1 the week of October 16, 1976. It spent 14 weeks at the top of the charts and an impressive 35 weeks in the Top Ten.  The project yielded a total of 4 Top 40 singles two of which went all the way to #1.

As far as I am concerned ""I Wish"" is one of the two or three best singles Stevie Wonder ever released.  The tune earned Stevie a Grammy for the Best R&B Male Vocal performance of 1976.  This song has it all:  fabulous music, a powerful vocal and a dynamic lyric.  This is an artist who is clearly at the top of his game.",1491955200,5

5058,1127,885,"As a long as I can remember, Weezer has been one of my all time favorite bands from my youth. When they finally came back from their long hiatus with their self title in 2001 they have been cranking out new music by the boat loads. Unfortunatly while there have been hits like 'Keep Fishin', 'Pork and Beans' and 'Memories', their albums as a whole have been hit or miss at best. Their previous album really made me feel that they were coming back to their classic ways with a very strong album in 'Everything Will Be Alright in the End' Their new self-titled 'White Album' is a long miss from that level. The songs are not memorable and the album just does not resonate.

I feel that like some of my other favorite bands this is another that I am just going to give up on when it comes to future releases. I feel that Weezer has left their mark on music but, there is no reason to stick around knowing that your band will not be forgotten. Best not to drive the rest of your loving fan base away.",1492300800,3

Even without Tom DeLouge you get the classic Blink 182 sound espeiccaly in songs like 'Kings of the Weekend' and 'Rabbit Hole' It is so great to have this sound back in a time when music that is considered popular just flat out stinks.,1492300800,4

5079,1389,671,"In movement 1 when my volume was set right for double ff passages some passages were so pianissimo as to be inaudible, a problem without a solution.  The melody is beautiful, and the orchestration sounds typical of Mahler.  Some of movement 2 sounds too loud and chaotic, even strident; Mahler never wrote such repulsive music.  Movements 2-3 employ the harsh sound of trumpet more than Mahler would.  The themes of movement 3 sounds Mahlerian.  Some parts of movement 4 are frenzied, and I instinctively recoil from them.  On the other hand, there are some brief pretty melodies.  Mahler was not so profligate in his use of fff.  Movement 5: after the attack of the bass drum, the soft flute and violin melody was a welcome relief.  The tuba-bass drum-trumpet onslaught at 5-7 minutes is bad enough, only to be followed by harrowing musical experiences of more strident passages.  At 13 minutes a lovely melody in woodwinds and French horn enters, spoiled at 18 minutes by a dreaded crescendo.",1492387200,2

I still think these remasters sound a little bit muddy like the Abkco CD. I am playing this on a decent quality Sony boombox CD player and I think it is muddy. I'm listening to this CD by downloading flac versions from YouTube of this particular album, and I used it to help complete my Ronettes Phille Spectre anthology double CD of their complete recorded output. I have titled it ""Be My Baby: Complete Original Phille's Anthology 62- 66"". I think instead of releasing this 18 track disc, it would have been a better idea to include all the masters over 2 discs on 36 tracks. The Ronettes discography is really small, and it could all cram itself on a double album. Everything here is wonderful and everything not here is great.

5099,1127,2535,"American Authors are one of the most unique acts in music today. With 4 guys from 4 corners of the United States coming together with each of their own regional music styles. American Authors is a perfect blend of all American sound. With a success of their debut I have to admit that their follow up while it is good, will take time to fully appreciate. The songs a little more musically complex and the lyrics are just as heart felt and personal. The only disadvantage of this sophomore release is that most of the songs do not have the radio appeal as a large portion of the tracks on the first album.

As time moves on the more you listen to this album there is a very good chance that you will enjoy this album and possibly feel that it could be better than their debut from a musical perspective. However, you can be your own judge.",1492473600,4

5121,874,1193,"I just have to say this -- I have no idea why this song is titled ""Iris.""  The name doesn't crop up anywhere in the lyrics, and while I don't believe that a song's title has to be part of the lyrics (see Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or Green Day's ""Good Riddance""), it can be confusing to people trying to search for the song online.  The song did first appear on the soundtrack of the film ""City of Angels,"" which I haven't seen, so perhaps the title has something to do with the movie?  *shrug*

At any rate, despite the possible confusion over the name, this is a lovely song, a love ballad with powerful guitar music and melancholy but warm and inviting vocals.  It's probably not the greatest love song of the '90s, but it's certainly one of the most memorable, and continues to resonate with listeners long after the film it debuted in has largely faded from memory.  Perfect for fans of the '90s or for love-song enthusiasts.",1492560000,4

Her songs are made for the adult in you, whether slow or fast, and her voice matches her music. Her lyrics are of that level that being an adult will make you undestand, and her duets with Usher & Jhene Aiko shows that she has the ability to play with the big kids on the musical playground.  This is THAT cd that the fav alternates with each spin.  Right now, track #2 is my fav, but I'm sure that will change.  She is that talent that should have a larger platform, but no worries, because if what I heard was any indication of what she can deliver, her base will get larger, because real music deserves a real audience, and no doubt she will receive one.",1492646400,5

5202,549,2146,"There really have not been all that many songs that have really drove from the world of country music the past several years. The songs have either been gently from one zone in sales, but have not crossed over for better success or they just haven't had the chemistry that delivers for it with the work accomplished. For Keith Urban, he has had a lot of joy in his career with his success in country music. But overall, he has not had that widespread success cross over into the pop world, as was the case with Shania Twain or Faith Hill had delivered. Now, with a slew of good performances he has had, he now is trying to cross over with pop with his latest single, The Fighter from his album, Ripcord. the song, which features Carrie Underwood, works well for him as a solo track, but as a duet it misses the mark a bit. Carrie Underwood surprisingly underperforms on the song with having more of a voice into the pop anthem. While it sounds like a hit for Keith, and it is, there could've been a bit more chemistry into the track overall. It is a good download for die hard Keith Urban fans, but there could've been more from Carrie for a higher score.

5242,1324,2566,"If you're one of the moral minority with a healthy disdain for stock drum machine rhythms, sound-alike synth patches, and vocals that are compressed, de-essed, and auto-tuned to the point of emotional sterility, then dive right into Lake Street Dive.  Side Pony is the bands fifth release, another refinement of the bands original sound conceived by the quartet at the New England Conservatory and birthed in Boston.  No, this is not a hoity-toity recital of sterile adroitness.  Lake Street Dives chops rock a side pony (its a hairstyle) with doses of retro soul, R&B, jazz, rock, and Brill Building banter.  Vocalist Rachael Price belts out a fierce independence, and bandmates Mike McDuck Olson (guitar, Rhodes, and trumpet), Bridget Kearney (upright and electric bass), and Philadelphias Michael Calabrese (drums and percussion) answer in kind.  Its all in the key of fun.  The Motown echoes of Call Off Your Dogs, the wry laments of Mistakes, the ping-ponged guitars of Hell, Yeah, and the carefree confidence of the title track are each sound examples of how it used to be done before the machines took over the Top 40.  Lake Street Dive is Beantowns answer to Phillys Hall & Oates (whose Rich Girl they even covered on an earlier EP).  To paraphrase, because they rock a side pony, baby, they're just livin their life, because they rock a side pony.",1493078400,4

One happy result however is showing even at that late stage in his career, he was very engaged in his repertoire , albeit not as recorded in the studio .we must surmise he was fed up with some of the choices he was forced to make through the publishing company and how his final equalizations were dismissed .

5302,887,1638,"This is one of those albums that I really wanted to like, or least wanted to like more than I did. Not sure what the problem was for me. This ""type"" of music is normally the sort of stuff that I love. It's a very soulful blend of music (pop, rock, R&B, whatever you want to label it) with some definite retro roots in the old Stax and Hi Records sound. Great organ playing too. And yet, two dozen plays later, it never left a strong impression on me.

Honestly, it really bothers me that I didn't get into this album that much. I had such high expectations after reading so many glowing reviews and positive articles about the band and I'm truly disappointed. The vocals of the lead singer aren't bad, but neither are they particularly distinct or memorable. While I admire the group's obvious love of old soul music, the overall sound is a bit derivative and nothing special. And that sums up most of the songs too. Clearly, this band has their hearts --- and soul --- in all the right places, but it feels, and sounds, like something crucial is missing.",1493337600,3

5374,1578,1937,"""The Suburbs"" is Arcade Fire's much acclaimed third album. It's a relatively long album, which plays for about one hour; so it may take some time to get a good overview of the music.
If you got the grip of the very exciting debut album ""Funeral"", you should be likely to enjoy more music in the same genre. It can be difficult to describe the music in few words, but groups like Velvet Underground and Talking Heads must be among the inspiration sources. The sound may seem a bit scratched at times, but the numbers are quite varied, ranging from the very melodic to the noisy and punked.

An important prerequisite for being able to keep Arcade Four right, I think, is that you appreciate the two singers of the group, of whom Win Butler obviously is the most important one. The female voice, R&eacute;gine Chassagne, may appear a little flimsy, but she also possesses a speciality that some will enjoy and others dislike. Personally, I'm a fan of both of them, especially when they deal with melodic songs with the group; On this album one could highlight ""Half Light"", ""Suburban War"", ""Deep Blue"", ""We Used to Wait"" and ""Sprawl II"".
In general, you might say that Arcade Fire is a group that sets certain demands for its listeners; Not much easy listening here.",1493510400,5

5432,1594,1123,"Mr. Sandman by the Chordettes is now ubiquitous Americana. Even if the name doesn't ring a bell you have almost certainly heard it. It graced the end of Halloween, the classic horror film and has been in any number of movies depicting the fifties era. I dare say it makes you feel like it's the fifties. The Chordettes are important in rock history as one of the first ""Girl Groups"" as they were called, to break into the charts at a time when sexism was standard practice and other phenomenal groups (Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Roy Orbison to name a few) were king. Many female vocalists existed but these harmonies belonged to the Chordettes and gave them a place. Mr. Sandman happens to be the creme de la creme of their work in my opinion.",1493683200,5

It was released in March 1970 as the first single and title track from the album Hello Darlin. The song was Twitty's fourth No. 1 song on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart.[1] The song spent four weeks atop the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart that summer, and was named the No. 1 song of 1970. Aside from being Twitty's standard concert opener, the song became a country standard as well as his signature song.

5567,783,2079,"Handel is a composer I love to listen to.  As such, I have recordings of his music that I prefer.  However, I didn't buy this for me.  It is part of a group of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections that I purchased for my son's sensory integration therapy. They aren't able to get him to wear headphones for the Auditory Integration Therapy at his occupational therapy clinic, and some studies have indicated the listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits, so I purchased this along with several others. So, while I have another version of the ""Messiah"" in particular that I prefer to this,  I feel like this has met the need for which it was purchased, and I'm a huge fan of the price point.",1494028800,5

5571,783,2668,"This is one where I'm rating it pretty much based on value.  This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.",1494028800,5
5572,783,2098,"I'm starting to sound like a broken record on these.  Again, this is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son, who has a deeply entrenched dislike of headphones.  Actually, that's an oversimplification.  It would be more accurate to say that they feel radically different on his head then they would to you or I and he  still can't tolerate that sensation well most of the time, and there's probably a sensitivity to sound component in there as well.  Usually the best we can get is for him to allow them around his neck for a short period of time while one of his favorite movies plays on my kindle.  Music generally is too unmotivating to even get him to try and deal with the headphones from his perspective.  Since the type of Auditory Integration Therapy used by my son's OT clinic uses headphones, we've been kind of dying on that hill, but some of the studies into the efficacy of this method for treating sensory issues have indicated that traditional, unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits.  So we purchased these a while back as a work around it, trying to still get the job done kind of solution and have been quite satisfied with them.  The price point is awesome, which given that we pour money like crazy on therapeutic supports for our son, I am a big, big fan of.",1494028800,5

5574,783,2669,"This was another ""Rise of the Masters"" purchase I made to support some occupational therapy goals for sensory integration for our son shortly after he was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  Because of the strength of his reactions to things, sometimes I find myself needing to find middle ground no matter how much I admire and respect the therapists who work with him and their recommendations.  Many OT clinics like to do The Listening Program with sensory processing disorder or Autistic kiddos, and our little man does *not* do headphones.  We've been working on it, working on it, working on it...and we have brief periods of time where he will tolerate it, and most of the time he either rips them off his head or gets agitated at the mere sight.  So in looking at the studies on The Listening Program and AIT therapy in general, some of the information indicates that listening to traditional unmodulated classical music can have similar benefits.  So I purchased a whole bunch of these because the price point was great and they were digital and I could access them from multiple devices.  This is the other collection my son will listen to for a longer period of time then the others.  He prefers the Mozart one, but he'll get through more of this one before requesting it be turned off then he will the remainder of them.",1494028800,5

5576,783,2670,"I have always, always loved Mozart.  But that's not why I purchased this. I bought several of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections a few years back shortly after our son was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  An OT recommended The Listening Program, but my little man doesn't do headphones.  And everything I looked at study wise on that seemed to be mixed, with some studies indicating that listening to plain classical music alone would produce similar benefits.  So I purchased these to play quietly in the background as we did other things.  Of all of the collections we got, he tolerates Mozart the longest.  I always knew that kid of mine had great taste ;)  The thing that to me is the stand out thing about this product is how many tracks you get for the price, and the quality if fine for what we were using it for.",1494028800,5

5600,867,2132,"Having had, at one time, THE BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW vinyl LP, it was often played and had a limited lifetime.  My two favorite tracks were of course her magnum opus Poetry Man which gave her star status out of the starting gate with her first album; and secondly her fantastic take on The Beatles Don't Let Me Down.  I wanted these two replaced so badly, I purchased them as digital downloads for my phone music player as soon I saw the 2001 release of the VERY BEST OF CD which expands on the original by 6 more tracks.  Ms Snow's first and foremost talent is that four-octave bluesy contralto that was unique in the 70's and still is today (sadly she passed 6 years ago last month); then there is her unique finger play on ""lead"" acoustic guitar, a velvety touch with lilting grace that hammers at just the right accent spots for making her music style all her own.  Poetry Man is also a one-of-a-kind piece of musical art, it seems to occupy a space somewhere between jazz, folk, and the blues, a space where there seems to be no competition and was simply way ahead of its time.  The closest in musical style you can come to it is Dave Matthews' work, his own being an artistic spot where the three genre experiment with each other, close but not quite like Phoebe Snow.  Her Calypso inflected Beatles cover is also highly unique and Snow just owns it.  One of my favorite songs by my favorite artist, she took it from them and bent it slightly around the middle, making a blues rock composition into a Caribbean gospel folk ballad.  The Gospel Choir never overwhelms Snow's perfect-pitched delivery and her soft-scat coda.  If you download either of these two gems, and you seriously love them (how can you not?) then I urge you with all sincerity to grab hold of the VERY BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW CD.",1494288000,5

5603,874,2677,"""The Princess Bride"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, and has managed to endure as a fantasy classic.  And its end-credits song fits it perfectly -- a sweet and moving number with gentle but loving vocals and lyrics that fit the story of the film but can still stand well on their own.  It's a fairly low-key number, especially compared to many modern pop songs that seek to overwhelm the listener, but sometimes a low-key song gets its point across better than something bombastic.

If you like love songs at all, or are a fan of ""The Princess Bride,"" you owe it to yourself to check this song out.  You won't be disappointed.",1494288000,5

5773,906,1324,"Fantastic collection from the sneeeeshht mister himself. Growing up, I was a John and George man, being more drawn to songs like The Inner Light, Within Without You, Norwegian Wood and Rain. Especially since the early McCartney cd issues generally sounded like they needed an upgrade (though not as bad as the horrible 80s Beatles cds) I never really dipped into Maccas solo career. With the announcement of the Paul McCartney Archive reissues I started seeing what I had missed. This collection in particular is a really well rounded collection that will have you obsessed with Paul by the end of it. I really wish Call me Back Again and Love in Song (with its Indian/modal sounds like a big inspiration for songs like The Numbers from Radioheads Moon Shaped Pool) from Venus and Mars were collected here as they are among my favorite Paul McCartney numbers ever. Momma Miss America from his debut is an amazing instrument with Paul playing all the instruments and with its White Album vibes definitely deserved a spot on a 4 cd collection. Some notes/reactions to the ditties; Silly Love Songs  Wow, what can I say. I must be getting old and dorky (31) because I love this song. Not that I don't love the LSD days of the aforementioned John and George Songs anymore, but Ive come to love Silly Love Songs. Im not really sure what this song was supposed to be fighting. Paul had just realeased Band on the Run and Venus and Mars and most of these songs and non album singles of the era aren't really little ditties pop songs that Silly Love Songs is a reaction too. Anyways its very much a disco era pop sneessht hit that reaches 6 minutes. Love it. Pipes of Peace a great single with interesting use of table (was pretty surprised to hear table in a 1983 McCaryney single). Listen What the Man Said Another smooth commercial sounding song, I would have dismissed back in the day, but now just comes across as so good, that I want to hear it over and over again. Wanderlust  a great orchestral type song with George Martin producing. The melody is based on a part of Symphony no. 3 by Camille Saint Saens and has been covered by Brian Wilson. This song is from Tug of War this album made me realize I was missing out on not giving Maccas solo career more of a shot. Band on the Run  the closest he got to prog in his solo career.

5780,1324,2735,"Produced by The E Street Bands Steven Van Zandt, this CD is nothing but a good time!  The irony in the album title is that that Love is a well-known shadow singer, having sung backups and harmonies for an array of artists including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Dionne Warwick, The Beach Boys, and even U2.  Her Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home) is a signature holiday staple, which she reprises each year in a NYC holiday show.  She appeared in 20 Feet from Stardom, the 2013 documentary on the lives of backup singers to the stars.  Love turns 76 this year [2017], and, if this album is any indication, shes about as far from a rocker and a shawl as one can get.  Among the Believers (a Van Zandt original) bangs open the doors, and 13 tracks later, Jesus Is the Rock (That Keeps Me Rollin) (another Van Zandt rant) takes the party home with an all-out gospel shout.  In between, new songs by Linda Perry, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Webb, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, and Bruce Springsteen give Love fresh material to make all her own.  The roots of rock and R&B lace through every song on the disc, giving new power to Loves girl-group origins.  But the hands-down highlight is Loves rip through River Deep, Mountain High, which should come with a warning  it will inspire impromptu air-mic moves that could be downright embarrassing, depending on where you hear this.",1494979200,5

5805,549,165,"It is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented dies early & before their time. With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar. If you have honestly never heard a Soundgarden song before, this should be the first and the last one that you should go back to each time.

5811,549,165,"It is absolutely so sad whenever someone young and talented dies early & before their time. With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression. It is just a tragic reminder of how very fragile someone's life can really be from beginning to end. Soundgarden really was more of a underrated band in the realm's of grunge music's legacy. Where as the case with Pearl Jam & Nirvana being looked upon as music legends. But Chris Cornell did show a sincere voice with a very fragile heart at the soul. That is the case with some of Soundgarden's masterpieces, and Black Hole Sun has remained the Soundgarden opus that many fans will continue to come back to. The song has been a very deep hard rock delight at despair, sorrow and prayer at the soul of the rifts by the guitar. If you have honestly never heard a Soundgarden song before, this should be the first and the last one that you should go back to each time.

Can we swim a lake by the ocean, Well be one like drops in slow motion. - Maxwell, Lake By The Ocean.

(Courtesy of Amazon Prime Music)
Five GROOVING Stars. From the 2016 album blackSummersnight, this is the Grammy Award-winning song by the double Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer, and actor Maxwell. He has planned his musical career over long periods of time, followed by his eagerly-awaited albums becoming hits and spawning hit singles. Considering the significant gaps of time between them, up to 7 years, including 2 albums from the trilogy with variations of the words blacksummersnight, his artistry has shown bright throughout his career. This album was preceded by the 2009, Grammy-winning album, Blacksummersnight.

On Lake by The Ocean, written by Musze (Maxwell) and Hod David, which won the Grammy for Best R&B Song, Maxwell establishes a definite catchy groove that persists throughout the song and drives the simple, repetitive, but brilliant lyrics. Over a deliberate beat from the urgent drums, Maxwell uses his natural range voice to tell the story, switching to his falsetto voice range to raise the intensity with repetition of the refrain on this song. This song lingers in the mind long after the music has stopped. The musical support group includes the likes of Hod David on bass and other instruments, Robert Glasper on keyboards, Darryl Lil Man Howell or Mark Colenburg on drums, Derrick Hodge on bass, and others.

6006,1761,425,"The memorable bass line is played by Herbie Flowers - he played both upright and electric bass, producing this amazing woody elastic sound. Lou Reed strums a relaxed guitar, the drums are played with quietly swinging brushes. It feels like both an intimate after hours gathering on an empty, graffiti-covered subway car, and bedtime story hour at an 'adults only' bookstore. A lullaby for artistic freaks, fiends and friends living in a depraved and dirty, yet stimulating and inspiring city where anything goes. An ode to the characters who came to New York and became part of Andy Warhol's factory crowd. Top it all off with that fantastic saxophone from Ronnie Ross, and the train clickety clacks away down the tracks with dawn just showing in the east.",1495756800,5

6011,1763,2789,"I bought the vinyl with great expectations in '68.  Back then it was pitched as a guitar summit, believe it or not, with Koopers vocals and keyboards added as padding.  One of my first encounters with buyer's remorse.  Don't get me wrong --Bloomfield kept his part of the bargain, more or less.  But he was the only member of the triumvirate who did.

Imagine how great ""Super Session"" could have been if Kooper had jammed with his erstwhile ""discovery,"" Shuggie Otis, instead of Stephen Stills. Shuggie's father was Johnny Otis, a rhythm and blues bandleader of tremendous talent and influence, compared to whom Al Kooper was the flea on the dog.  Shuggie himself was a prodigy -- a skilled guitarist and a fine vocalist, long before he had reached draft age.  It is ironic, to say the least, that he should have required an album like ""Al Kooper Introduces Shuggie Otis"" (released just months before Super Session) to introduce him to (white) baby boomer blueslovers.  The album was a relative flop because it was too much Kooper and his ego, not enough Otis.  A ""super"" jam session, on the other hand, in which Koopers contributions were held on a choke chain, might have served Shuggie far better.  Otiss fluid style would have been an interesting foil for Bloomfields hard-driving Chicago blues.  And his voice would have been a major improvement over Koopers.  Could have been great -- too bad that Columbias brain trust (and perhaps also Kooper) decided that the guitar wah-wah wizardry of Steve Stills was what baby boomer blueslovers needed to hear most of all. Otis never really found his niche outside of his father's band  and friends like Kooper (and later, Stevie Wonder) did not help.

Actually, the packaging of ""Super Session"" was not fair to Stills either.  He was, after all, only a modestly talented folk rocker with a few good Buffalo Springfield tunes behind him.  His role in Buffalo Springfield was for the most part secondary -- Richie Furay was a better singer, and Neil Young was a better song writer and musician.  Stills was just the ""other guy.""  He had no special talent as a player whatsoever, and is remembered these days primarily for the high-schoolish poor-me love song that he wrote, and actually performed publicly, about his unresolved boner for Judy Collins.  His playing on ""Season of the Witch"" is awful  deserving of Kooper's awful vocals.  After Super Session, no one ever again dared to market Stills for his instrumental prowess.

On the other hand, Mike Bloomfield was a great blues guitarist, and too toughened by years of touring with Butterfield to allow himself to be overshadowed by the likes of Al Kooper.  Working with Kooper was like working with rattlesnakes, but Bloomfield pulled it off well enough to produce solid, blues-oriented jamming.  If Super Session had been Bloomfield, and a keyboardist with decent vocal skills, it would be worthy of four enthusiastic stars (as there is nothing in it that comes close to matching ""East-West,"" I wouldnt give it five).  Throw in Stills and Kooper, and four stars drop down to two.  In what respect any of this was ever considered ""super"" is beyond me.  It is more like ""Schizo Session,"" half solid, half a waste of time.",1495843200,2

Many Bomba albums I've heard have all been about recording the history of it, rare is the record that's just done for having fun, unique when it's done taking into account today's culture.

He likes to have fun with his lyrics, yet at the same time it's noticeable he worked hard on them.  One song where he uses names of towns to tell the story was very well done.  He does a mix of original material and covers, but the covers sound very modern too.",1495929600,5

6054,1779,1953,"I would put 5/5 stars ,but the sound quality in some of the tracks is not that good .Actually there are 3 or 4 tracks that have a fairly BAD quality and tracks such as ""International Smile"" or ""It Takes Two"" whose quality is TE RRI BLE .So 1/3 of the whole LP is sadly of a bad quality .

Another problem is that the picture record sleeves (which look AMAZING) are made out of cardboard and cardboard is NOT a good material for record sleeves .

The tracks themselves are really good and the album is amazing as a whole .

The LP's representation is well thought and definitely of a good quality .

If it weren't for the bad sound quality in almost half of the tracks ,this album definitely would have gotten 5 stars from me .",1496016000,3

6065,1761,2674,"What to say about this one? It's a classic instrumental one hit wonder, the archetypal breezy cheezy 70s pop AM radio hit. I love the fade in, the organ, and the rhythm guitar. I especially love the electric guitar solo, it has that recorded in a cave reverb quality. Not crazy about the horns during the song, but I love them during the build up at the end. And the tiny one second drum break around 2:01 is cool. I don't know if Bach would have liked it, but I think it's a pretty cool arrangement and from a long gone era in pop music when hit songs were allowed to be unapologetically geeky and joyful.",1496102400,5

If tomorrow never knows, then today knows? And yesterday always knows? or knew? Future, present, past. It all merges together here in a big psychedelic daydream. Drums and bass lay down the groove, weird screechy birds swoop around, play everything backwards, John sounds like he's flying all around us in a state of pure cosmic energy. We could be in prehistoric times running around with dinosaurs, or cruising through another galaxy in a rocket, or in a comfortable room at home.

It shouldn't be so hard to live a simple, kind-hearted life and to be happy.

However, the first eight tracks sound strident, and I question the necessity of playing so extremely loud, which makes it unpleasant to listen to.  And the first eight tracks have minimal melody.  These criticisms don't apply to the last track, which is softer, melodic jazz, but it's spoiled by the bass's being far too loud.",1496275200,3

This is another self indulgent Rant,Ramble, and Rave, set to a dull monotonous undertone.. So much of the recording is effect, and Unpleasant background noise. VERY LITTLE MUSIC AT ALL ! Unlike a Gilmore release, which is still Poignant, and challenges the listener to listen, think, yet STILL enjoy !!
The high points of this disk are  ""Smell the roses"", a distinct nod to past Floyd brilliance, Then ""Oceans apart which transcends into Wait for her,
(( which, if you listen is Just Floyd's song ""MOTHER"", re-penned.. )) but still worth the listen.
Over all, this is Pablum..

I usually don't make big mistakes when identifying artists is the subject.  Even back in the 80's somehow I never realized ""All Through the Night"" was by Cyndi Lauper.

6171,1816,1390,"I cant believe Im writing this after all the drama and a string of, at best, mediocre and forgettable albums but Queensryche has had a resurgence in recent years. Much of that has to do with throwing longtime senior Geoff Tate overboard and bringing on Todd La Torre to replace him.

Two years after releasing a self-titled album in 2013, Queensryche offered another excellent effort in Condition Human. The album starts out strong with Arrow of Time and Guardian, high octane tracks which sound like they could have been from the bands early days. As the album continues along, there are enough tracks that most progressive metal fans and longtime Queensryche supporters should enjoy what they here. Even the slower tracks get on base though, admittedly, there are a lot of doubles and triples here instead of a bunch of home runs.

The new incarnation of the band has matured since its 2013 outing and La Torre has grown, sounding less like Tate and finding his unique niche in the band. The band is in great form here with strong work from Scott Rockendield on drums, Michael Wilton and Park Lundgren on guitar and Eddie Jackson on bass.

Theres far more energy and enthusiasm here than in most of the bands recent efforts and that makes this the best album the band has crafted in decades. Even without anything as stellar as their best songs from Rage for Order or Operation Mindcrime or Empire, this is still a great album. Highly recommended.",1496448000,5

6179,1819,2825,"When I first learned about this release  recently available in the US via Music Video Distributors  I didn't release that this British release was issued in the UK last year and that there were reviews up here already.  But, Ill add mine here too because I do have some local connections to the concert on this CD. And, I do feel that it can be recommended to all Joni fans as well as anyone hanging around Philadelphias Rittenhouse Square in the 1960s and listening every Sunday night to The Folk Show with Gene Shay (the dean of Folk DJs who only retired from the air a year ago.).

The location of this live concert which was broadcast from Temple Universitys student-run radio station  WRTI  was one of Phillys venerable coffee houses  The Second Fret (now long gone) on Sansom Street. After performances many of the artists would head to Genes show for interviews. I distinctly remember when Joni was still married to her husband Chuck and both would play live on Genes show.

Anyway, back to the CD at hand. No, it is not high fidelity, but its still easy to listen to. The club was SMALL and so there always was some sort of echo, which youll hear on this disc. But, there are four song that Joni never recorded as studio recordings. The full concert is here  79-minutes worth!  and the recording includes her spoken intros  which were often lengthy. The intros are NOT indexed but come AFTER the previous song is sung.

My friend, retired professor Mike Biel, worked at WRTI in those days and told me that he helped engineer this broadcast.
This 1966 gig was two years before her first album release so you get to hear her (now) well-known songs in their early stages. And its just Joni playing here. No other musicians.

I don't know the source of this recording, but Im sure glad it was released. As I said, the sound is okay (and Im sure there are no better copies out there  these cannot be remastered). So, if you are a big Joni fan  or one of the mid-1960s Philly folkies like me, youll want to hear this.

UI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The setting just looked so dreary with a bit of anxiety thanks to the expressions of the band members, and perhaps my beat up/bad picture quality TV elevated the dreary vibes.  This song is truly nostalgic for me.  With that said it took me years to actually appreciate the melody.  The verse melody is stellar (which I didn't realize at the time and warmed up to it a lot more in recent years) and the chorus is pretty awesome too.",1496448000,4

6192,1823,2820,"This is probably Roger Waters' best solo album because it sounds so much like Pink Floyd. Similar sounds, lyrical content and even sound effects that were used on Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut are used again.

Many of the same, sinister forces that Waters' has been railing against for the past 50 years are still present: jingoism, nationalism, greed, broken politics, racism, fear-mongering, etc. I guess this is why the music is so similar to his past work. Is This The Life We Really Want? Roger has concluded that it is because nothing has changed.

The real musical revelation is session drummer Joey Waronker. Every note he plays is so tight and perfect. I'll check out his other work.

6206,1814,2833,"I used to hate Blind Melon's ""No Rain"".  When it came out I wanted nothing to do with the singer's unusual singing style.  But now I seem to realize that time has done this song *very* well and I'm able to appreciate it with open ears. The melody is actually really stellar and well-written.  I was too obsessed disliking the singer's voice (Shannon Hoon) to notice the melody back in 1992.  I look back and think Shannon Hoon's singing style was a little ahead of its time.  I wasn't prepared for it.  Now I find myself singing the line ""All I can say is that my life is pretty plain, you don't like my point of view you think that I'm insane!"" all the time!",1496620800,5

When I was a tyke I was obsessed with the Warsaw Concerto - I loved it and bought every version I could find on LP.  And the same for CD.  I always love the piece, of course, and I have loved some of the bands and soloists who've played it - but I've never found a great-sounding performance, meaning technically great sounding.  Until now.  Now we have a perfectly played and just as importantly, perfectly recorded performance.  This is beautifully engineered.  I must take exception with the fellow who said the piano is overpowered by the band - not so - balances are fine.  And this is how you record an orchestra - up close and personal and none of that washy, distant sound where all orchestral detail is lost in a haze of whatever.

It was almost like I was hearing it for the first time, especially on the fade out chorus. I'd always appreciated his playing, but this time it really hit me how great it truly is.
I love when John's vocals take on that faraway hue on 'cellophane flowers...', it's like OK, Dorothy opened the door from her black and white world and entered the colorful land of Oz. Well, in this song, we start out already in Oz and on the cellophane part we open a door into an even more amazing land - John's imagination! This is psychedelic pop at its best. Alice in Wonderland, woooo!",1496793600,5
6246,995,2820,"An excellent Roger Waters solo album. The Last Refugee is as good or better than anything he's written. Working with Radioheads producer a great move. A couple of songs derivative of the Pink Floyd formula (not talking about the Gilmour/Mason/polly Samson version (which is NOT Pink Floyd on any level). If songwriting is important to you, if you are pissed about that garbage album Endless River that Gilmour and Mason crapped out for a load of $, Listen to this. Sid Barrett initially and Roger Waters were the indispensable members of Pink Floyd.

6270,954,2850,"I recently saw Frazey Ford in concert (more on that later). The (erstwhile?) member of the great Be Good Tanyas has been quite active since the Be Good Tanyas went on (forever?) hiatus in 2007. Ford issued a well-received solo album in 2010 with ""Obadiah' and the followed that up with this album in 2014.

""Indian Ocean"" (11 tracks including the ""hidden"" bonus track; 47 min.)  opens with ""September Fields"", about as accessible as anything Ford has done before. Immediately apparent in the sound are the warm horns. Turns out this is non other than the legendary Hi Rhythm Section, holy cow! Things slow down a bit on ""You're Free"". The album has a pretty nice overall R&B feel to it, check out ""Done"" (1st radio single) as a great example. Side B opens with the deceptively slow ""You Got Religion"". Another highlight deeper into the album is the hard-charging ""Natural Law"". But it all leads to the epic (and album-closing) title track, a 6+ min. journey (with observations like ""You come again and again/And you, you're sorry/You're sorry/For what you've done""). The ""hidden track ""September Fields"" is an acoustic version of the album's opening song, just Frazey and her guitar. Bottom line: this is a delightful album on many levels. I have no idea whether the Be Good Tanyas will ever come together again, but it's clear that Frazey Ford has found her own path and voice.

Just this past weekend I saw Frazey Ford in concert at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Fest here in Ohio. Ford and her band played an hour long set in the late afternoon on the main stage, and the crowd absolutely loved her. She played mostly from ""Indian Ocean"" but also a couple of tunes that I didn't recognize and am quite certain these are new songs. Given that it took her 4 years between the first and second solo album, here's hoping we'll get a new album next year (at the latest!). If you have a chance to see Frazey Ford live, don't miss her!",1496880000,4

6297,1761,1286,"One of my mellow faves. As close and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John's 'Your Song' or Rita Coolidge's 'We're All Alone'. If You Could Read My Mind includes a folky air of mystic dreaminess and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland. The music is pretty subdued, nice acoustic guitars and the use of one of my favorite techniques, the gently rising, unobtrusive string arrangement. Then there's Gord's voice, so soft and comfortable, like a perfectly worn baseball mitt. I also like that the lyrics don't always rhyme in the places where you think they should. It's a Dear Jane letter, the writer trying to explain why he is no longer in love, and having a hard time understanding it himself. Lots of cool images - a ghost from a wishing well, a fortress strong, a paperback novel from the drugstore, an old-time movie.

There are many different photos of Gordon Lightfoot out there...I prefer the rugged curly haired mustachioed mid 70s AM radio adult contemporary Gord's Gold version.",1497052800,5

6306,1761,225,"If You Leave Me Now is a nostalgic trip to my childhood. It was released in 1976, when I was nine years old. I have vivid memories of hearing it during that summer, driving around in the VW Beetle with my Mom, hanging out at the public pool as it played over the loudspeakers. In a way, it is a kind of security blanket. In my mind's catalogue of songs, it shares a drawer with 'If you could read my mind.' Maybe I like soft songs with 'if' in the title? Nah...'If'' by Bread would never be allowed past security. Kick that one to the curb. That's the song that starts out with that 'wawawawawa...wawawawawa...'sound. 'If a man could throw up on a song, then why can't I throw up on it too...' hahaha.

But......I digress. IYLMN was a global smash for Chicago, hitting #1 in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands. I think it inspired every song in Air Supply's catalogue. It starts out all soft and gentle, light horns and strings, a finger cymbal. Peter Cetera busts out his high-pitched Beach Boy vocals. Nice harmonies, a soft Terry Kath acoustic guitar solo, joined by strings. The only part I don't like is around 2:00, those rising strings are totally over the top and unnecessary. And I can always do without James Pankow and his trombone, ughhh. I especially love the layered string buildup on the outro. And how about Cetera's 'Oooh, girl, just got to have you by my side' scat. OK, this is not the kind of music I typically listen to, but it's like being a Cubs fan...I can't not like this song, no matter how I try. Now, 'Hard to say I'm sorry?' OMG, Yuck.",1497052800,5
6307,1849,2858,Brings back memories.,1497052800,5
6308,1761,2859,"How many zillions of guitarists learned the intro to this tune? Three. Three zillions. Simple enough: Em, then a little stroll up the neck to G, then Am, followed by the little stroll up the neck to C, then a B7 to round it out. Repeat. Then strum these chords during the verses.

Written by singer and guitarist Alvin Lee, it expresses bewilderment at the crazy madness going on in the world but also frustration at not knowing how to fix it. The guitar solo that comes in at 2:09 is a classic. If you've ever seen Woodstock, which my brother and I watched a zillion times, you also know about the great solo Alvin plays during I'm Going Home...'by helicopter.' Then he walks off stage with a watermelon.",1497052800,5
6309,1761,1365,"The classic line from Roadhouse Blues is 'Well I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer.' The middle section with all the nonsense Morrison words is great too:

You gotta beep a gunk a chucha
Honk konk konk
You gotta each you puna
Each ya bop a luba
Each yall bump a kechonk
Ease sum konk
Ya, ride

It's a rockin from the get go tune. Lonnie Mack plays bass on it, that's pretty cool. The opening guitar is just what I'd expect to hear at a roadhouse. Bikers and chains. Then I'd expect the beer drinkin, the sweat, the hollerin, the name callin, the fightin, but I don't know. I've never been to a roadhouse and I've never seen the Patrick Swayze film. Speaking of which, it has Sam Elliott and Ben Gazzara? How have I not seen this movie?! Is it really that bad?",1497052800,5
6310,1761,374,"Jimi Hendrix took this Bob Dylan tune and turned it into his own monumentally panoramically spaghetti westernly classic. Brian Jones on the vibraslap at the end of each opening bar, makes me think of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef calmly sizing each other up in some dusty lawless town. I never knew Brian Jones played on this, what a bittersweet discovery. Wow, Dave Mason too? Argghhh, can't believe I didn't know this...well, glad to know it now.

The story unfolds....the joker speaks to the thief about his troubles. The blues. Life is a drag. He finishes his words at 0:52 and Jimi cranks out a nice solo in solidarity. At 1:09, the thief 'kindly' speaks. He can sympathize and says there are 'many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.' But he says, let's not talk about this tonight, it's getting late.

1:43 - so the joker and thief wander off into the night, Jimi blazing a trail for them to follow. At 2:00 they fall asleep and are swept off into some sort of dream land (my favorite part). At 2:17 they wake from their slumber and realize they aren't quite sure where they are. A wah wah chaos of tumbleweeds and dust encircles them as they attempt to get their situation in order. 2:33 - back on some trail, with a growing sense of urgency.

2:50 - The joker and the thief have traveled over distance and time, and now out of nowhere they approach a fortress of princes, damsels, servants, possibly various other court attendants, who may have been aware of them for awhile, observing them from the watchtower. But they are not there yet. They must deal with growling wildcats and howling winds. I've always preferred a happy ending - they finally make it to the castle and are welcomed with hearty meals and bowls of mead.",1497052800,5

6312,1761,2370,"That opening moment is like a punch in the gut. What an intense song! A dramatic first 15 seconds, very intense and focused, then hurricane Janis roars in with the 'come on' vocals before taking it down into the first verse. But soon her intensity is back up and she is screaming out pain and suffering at the hands of the man she loves with abandon, but he treats her like you know what.  She's like, 'fine, keep crushing my heart if it makes you feel better', but she still can't bring herself to leave him. It's like an anti-torch song, or more like a flame thrower song. I like when Sam Andrew comes in with his vocals on the chorus. His guitar solos are awesome too.",1497052800,5
6313,1761,2500,"Oh yeah, groove is in the heart...this is a fond fun funky look back at childhood by the beautiful Stevie Wonder. The verses of I Wish are memories of carefree times, harmless naughtiness, and rites of passage that kids experience. You look back on it all as an adult, having learned to follow the rules but laughing inside because, even though you got in trouble, those activities were often pretty fun at the time.

The music says don't even bother trying to remain still, you have no choice but to get down and boogie. Listen to Stevie, he is really enjoying himself. Listen to that walking bass line, the horns, the drums pounding away. Cool middle part at 1:30, do do do do....break it down.

The extremely funky outro lasts for the final minute plus. The horn riff repeats over and over, as Stevie makes little shouts here and there, and Nathan Watts careens all over the bass with little spasms of funky joy. The horns rise up a couple times, Stevie plays a great drum roll at 4:03. And I guess we have to fade it out so Stevie has room for his other Songs in the Key of Life.",1497052800,5

6315,1761,983,"I've loved this song since I was nine years old and heard it being blasted out of a high school neighbor's bedroom window during the summer of 1976. I was often in the vicinity of that house, playing with other kids, and there was always a radio on somewhere..

The Boys Are Back in Town is a straight up rock classic. It features the twin lead guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson, bass and lead vocals by the late great ultra-talented Dubliner Phil Lynott. Look him up on youtube, there are at least two pretty cool documentaries about him. Lyrically and vocally, it always felt to me like an American Bruce Springsteen New Jersey kind of song, to wit:

And that time over at Johnny's place,
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her

I just picture Miller Lite neon signs and Chevys and baseball on the tv...down at Dino's, ya know? Hey, fuhgitaboutit.",1497052800,5
6316,1761,1139,"'Everything is everything.' I love the friendly chatter that opens this sweet tune. What's Going On was co-written by Renaldo 'Obie' Benson, a member of the Four Tops, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland, and Marvin Gaye. Benson had witnessed police brutality in Berkeley and was really shook up by it. He began to ask himself all sorts of questions, like why were kids being sent off to Vietnam? and why were kids being beaten at home? Marvin Gaye was asking himself, with all the problems going on in my country, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs? The song is a plea for people to talk with each other and explore alternatives to war and violence. 'For only love can conquer hate.' It's amazing to me that this song is still relevant all these years later. Will our world ever evolve to the kind of existence that everyone can enjoy?

Musically, I've always loved the drums. Marvin Gaye played a box drum accompaniment to the regular drums, producing this oversized ping pong ball quality. The saxophone opening is a classic. The legendary James Jamerson played the bass while laying on the floor. Excellent string arrangement.",1497052800,5
6317,1761,2860,"A fairly stripped-down blues, it has a bunch of nonsense lyrics (some ripped from a Chuck Berry tune, eventually leading to a lawsuit), and a great sudden electric guitar pronouncement as verse changes to chorus on 'together'. This is the Beatles as cool blues rock band. Nice guitar work from George. Paul plays his typically great bass lines. Electric piano (and handclaps) from John, rolling toms from Ringo. The final minute outro is a murky stroll down to the crossroads.",1497052800,5

6322,1761,2861,"There are so many great songs in existence, and if I had to pick one as my all time favorite, it would be Strawberry Fields Forever. It encompasses everything I love about pop music: dreamy lyrical imagery, moments of transcendent creative beauty, emotional impact, and of course certain intangibles that exist on a purely personal level. This is among the peaks of the creative union between the Beatles and George Martin. John Lennon wrote the song, but Martin added all the orchestration, spliced the tapes, mixed it all into a finished work of art.

There are a number of particular moments I love:
1) Guitar from 0:18-0:22
2) Guitar during second verse from 0:40-0:54
3) Drums from left speaker 1:00-1:10+, 1:44-2:00+, and 3:00+
4) Horn riff from 1:10-1:13, etc.
5) backward percussion after 1:26
6) double-tracked vocals from 2:27-2:32
7) Guitar from 2:58-3:00 and 3:10-3:12
8) starting at 3:35, the somewhat jarring cocktail party atmosphere with the scary siren thing that creeps back in after the initial fade out. I have a love hate deal with that part.

Battle of Evermore. Misty Mountain Hop also. Some LZ fans want every song to be about Lord of the Rings: 'hey dude, that song Hot Dog? It's about the hobbits wanting to enjoy some elevensies, you know, have a little snack after traveling so far.'

This is also one of their Light and Shade songs, featuring gentle acoustic guitars giving way to heavy electric guitars.

Something like that. Ramble On is also one of your Robert Plant double tracked vocal songs. You can hear it mostly at the end, it's like there are two Roberts singing, separate but equal. You can also hear this phenomenon in songs like Babe I'm Gonna Leave You and Whole Lotta Love.",1497052800,5

And the cover, with all the moving pictures meanings: men moving the pictures, people weeping due to being emotionally moved by the pictures and, on the back, the realization that this is a movie, aka a moving picture. Pretty clever, eh?

Lady crying because they are taking away her favorite painting: Naked Man in Pentagram. Hey Lou, how much we gettin paid to carry around the painting of the woman on fire? I dunno, Crosby. Don't touch the painting, kid.

I would sit there studying the entire cover and sleeve as the record played...transfixed and mystified.

Tom Sawyer challenged my 13 year old brain, first because the name of the song was a children's book character I knew about, but the lyrics were esoteric and spoke of ""today's Tom Sawyer"", a different one, a warrior, with 'mean mean pride.'

Fantastic opening synthesizer and drums. The heavy crunch of guitar. The singer with the high-pitched shriek.

Catch the mystery...

Today's Tom Sawyer he gets high on you and the space he invades he gets by on you....
1:33 the trippy modulated synth of Geddy Lee.
2:00 the radical angular guitar solo of Alex Lifeson.

Larry Knechtel, a member of the Wrecking Crew, plays piano. It was inspired by a song from the gospel group the Swan Silvertones. It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.

It is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon.

The back cover shows the resulting catastrophe...please don't try this at home.

Ch-keee, ch-keee, chk chk chk...that instrument is a guiro. It's being played by producer Jimmy Miller. Nicky Hopkins on heavy tolling bell piano. Merry Clayton accompanies Mick on the vocals and her presence adds that extra oomph to the theme of the song. I love that moment at 3:03, her voice rips the air as she screams out Rape, murder!, and Mick (I presume) lets out a woo! Keith's opening guitar riff is classic. Can't forget to mention Mick's harmonica. All the instruments together create a kind of super chord, intense and foreboding.",1497139200,5

Have You Seen Her is an early 70s R&B slow groove story of lost love. Dig that opening distorted guitar - bowwwww...bow wah bow wah bah ba ba baba...One month ago today, I was happy as a lark. The spoken word part lasts until 1:20 before the rest of the guys get to sing. They're like, yeah, you want some cheese with that whine? Man, she's gone and she's not coming back and you've been hanging out in a park with a bunch of kids for a whole month? What is wrong with you? The guy eventually admits that he's been used to havin someone to lean on, and now...well, I guess he has to make his own dinner and do his own laundry. At least he can go to the movies, or 'picture shows' if you will...by himself. Awww, he'll find someone else in another month...then he'll be singing 'I don't care if you've seen her, don't tell me if you've seen her.'

6360,1761,2060,"I remember hearing More Than A Feeling on a Saturday morning in the Fall of 1976, in our station wagon as my Mom drove me to gymnastics class. I liked the song so much that it caused me to make my first and worst mail order record purchase. The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.

I finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?

Later on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream.",1497139200,5
6361,1761,2870,"Miss You features a lush palette of twin guitars on a disco canvas. Just listen to that four on the floor drum beat, the offbeat bass strut. It is the foundation for the guitar exchanges between Keith and Ronnie. It seems like the guitars are playing something cool every second. Notice in particular these moments: 0:17, 0:26, 0:42-0:45, that little squeak at 1:10, and on and on...it's like finding musical pokemons. You just have to listen. Small/Faces Ian McLagan on electric piano and the great Sugar Blue on harmonica. Great riff.

Then there's Mick delivering a classic vocal, in particular on the spoken sections that serve to demonstrate how much Mick really misses, well, You, right? Not even his friends can entice him with Puerto Rican girls and cases of wine. He ends up stumbling around Central Park at night like some kind of crazy Aqualung figure, people think he's craaaazy.",1497139200,5

6365,1761,420,"A Day in the Life flows right out of Sgt Pepper's (Reprise) so you get a few seconds of the audience fade out as the gently strummed guitar enters. Majestic piano chords appear moments later. Then John Lennon's dreamy vocals come in on the first verse: I read the news today, oh boy, accompanied by light piano, maracas, and bass.

He blew his mind out in a car is a continuation of the first news story, and right after this line at 0:48 Ringo comes in with a dramatic drum fill, and he continues to fill in the spaces through the end of the verse.

After I'd love to turn you on at the end of the verse about seeing a film, the orchestra appears for the mind-blowing ascent into the clouds. Then we get Paul's nifty little woke up fell out of bed section. Jazzy piano lines.

One final verse about 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire, and then another epic orchestral maneuver, and we get to the final giant piano chord fadeout. The weird inner groove part is attached to the end of the song, which I wish wasn't there because it sometimes freaks me out to no end. There I am, all relaxed as the giant chord dissipates, then I get the shock of whatever it is...""I never could be any other way"" or something. Ughh, be quiet! Leave me alone!

I am often amazed by this song, like I almost can't believe anyone could create such a transcendent piece of music. It sits there at the end of the Sgt Pepper album in its own space, separate from the previous songs.. It is the room at the top, that you need a special code to enter. Truly a work of master craftsmen.",1497225600,5

6367,1761,1068,"Imagine Black Dog without those opening five seconds, or the whole Led Zeppelin IV album for that matter. Jimmy Page called it ""waking up the army of guitars."" It also prevents Robert Plant from sneaking up on us - we are ready when his voice bursts out of the speakers. The song is about a lustful old black Labrador Retriever that lived near Headley Grange during the recording sessions.

The precision of the music is indeed reminiscent of a military close-order drill. The main riff, written by John Paul Jones, represents the guitar army, layers of them, marching together, inspiring awe and respect. They even create a brass timbre somehow, at least to my ears. The call and response pattern lasts until 0:42, when the riff gets twisted up and discombobulated before righting itself at 0:52 as we head into the oh yeah break. Jimmy plays some nifty descending runs and we head into the second verse: I gotta roll can't stand still got a flamin heart can't get my fill.

At 1:27 we get a calming set of ah ah ah etc from Robert, but then at 1:38 John Bonham's drums explode with awesome power. This is a tremendously exciting moment, one of my favorites of any song. The levels are perfect: attack, loudness, reverb, emotional effect. Whoa. It takes us into another new part, the hey baby whoa baby I-don't-wear-pants-and-I'm-a-lecherous-black-dog part. This goes on until 2:04.

The song cycles back through the basic layout once more, adding a sweet guitar double helix at 3:07. Finally, at 3:37, the general of the guitar army proudly shows off the skills of improvised battle strategy, as the troops continue their parade with no signs of tiring.",1497225600,5

6378,1761,1000,"Is there a more romantic death song than Don't Fear the Reaper? Buck Dharma sings it like a lullaby, calm and easy. Death is a natural occurrence, and belief in an afterlife can make a person less afraid of it. They may even run to it.

Classic guitar riff, anyone who plays rock guitar has probably practiced it at some point in their lives. And of course there is the COWBELL! That SNL sketch was so brilliant, Christopher Walken 'THE Bruce Dickinson.' Yeah, the cowbell is fairly non-stop but it's low in the mix and often falls into a sonic blind spot so it tunes in and out of my consciousness. I think I almost typed couscousness there, ha ha that's what I was thinking...weird.

The guitar solo is pretty classic as well. Sometimes I wish they hadn't let the last note sustain so far into the verse, but not a deal breaker, Blue yster Cult. What a great name for a band. When I was younger, I thought they were scary, based on the cover of the 45 I had of Burnin for You. Ha ha, these guys are goofy. Where does one find blue oysters anyhow? Or is it a blue cult that worships oysters? Or does an umlaut over the 'o' mean something entirely different? Talk amongst yourselves.",1497225600,5

The opening Tear the roof off the sucker words are spoken by Ray Davis. The primary lyrics are grouped in three clusters, with multiple voices, crazy asides, harmonies and shouts.

6391,1761,2874,"Elegantly produced by Alan Parsons, Al Stewart's Year of the Cat is a classic of smooth 70s light rock. It's like going to bed on a warm summer night as a breeze blows lightly through the curtains. Like snuggling on a soft giant papasan chair in 1976 and having this on eight-track. Like buttah. No rough spots whatsoever; even the heavier guitar solo is balanced by strings to maintain the equilibrium.

If it were some sappy 70s love song I wouldn't like it. It's romantic, yes, but also esoteric and cool, like a Bogart movie. A tourist arrives in a town and meets a mysterious woman. He spends the night with her and in the morning realizes that he has been left behind by his tour group so he is stuck there. No big deal to him, he's carefree and open. Any way the wind blows....

It has some of my favorite lyrics of any song, especially:

She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain

Gives me goosebumps sometimes when I hear that.

Also, you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime. I had no idea who Peter Lorre was for a long time, but I knew his voice from cartoons. Eventually I saw him in Casablanca. He was also incredible in M.

She comes in incense and patchouli. Nowadays, whenever I hear the word patchouli I imagine John Cusack telling Tim Robbins to get his 'patchouli stink outta my store' in High Fidelity. Great film for music geeks.

The middle instrumental passage is great as well. It flows...strings at 3:10 into light electric guitar at 3:24 into heavier electric guitar at 3:54 into Phil Kenzie's superb saxophone at 4:14...then into the final verse.

FYI: the cat is the fourth animal symbol in the 12-year cycle of the Vietnamese zodiac, replacing the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac. So, if you were born in 1963, 1975, 1987, or 1999, you might be a cat.",1497312000,5

6400,1761,2876,"I remember hearing Fool in the Rain on the radio in 1980 and calling the radio station to find out what it was. I wasn't too familiar with Led Zeppelin yet, so I was later surprised at how poppy this song was compared to stuff like Whole Lotta Love. The middle samba section is fun, but the best part of the song is the awesome drum fill that comes out of it at 3:44. I get fixated on it sometimes and have to rewind and listen to it multiple times. Jimmy's guitar solo after the break is also one I like a lot. It's a bit sloppy, but so is standing in the rain.

Fool in the Rain is Robert Plant channeling his inner Elvis Presley and Bill Murray's Nick the Lounge Singer. He sings like he's suavely strolling on a Vegas stage with a glass in his hand...Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin' (thayouverymuch), like an ol star that can't wait for the night (you know what I'm talkin about), somebody get me a scotch and tonic, it's gonna be a long night, hrumph.

And I stand in the rain on the corner (with no umbrella mind you) just watchin people go shuffling on down-town-uh. Look at those crazy ol people, they gonna turn it aroun, roun roun. (hey where's Charlie Hodge with my scarf, I'm sweatin like a pig here, ladies and gentlemen). I'm a fool in the rain, I'm just a fool in the rain. I'm all wet and I'm cold and don't you know that I'm a fool in the rain, (scats: 'see I was on the wrong corner all along and so all this worryin was really unnecessary'). Hit it, Ron.

6438,1594,899,"I love the original styles with which Led Zeppelin is experimenting on this album. If you like Led Zeppelin, you will either love this release or you won't. There doesn't seem to be a lot of middle ground here. The love for the opening guitar sear, ""The Immigrant Song"" is pretty universal among Led Zeppelin songs. One of the surprises on this album is ""Tangerine"" which is acoustically beautiful. I have often wondered why I haven't heard it played more often on the radio. My advice is to listen to the samples of the songs and decide if the style on this album engages you.",1497484800,5

6469,1878,694,"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.
  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE",1497571200,3

6528,292,902,"Inspired by the Tibetan ""Book Of The Dead"" this is one of John Lennon's best songs during his time with The Beatles. It was the last track on the ""Revolver"" album and would be seen by many as s message the Beatles were sending to their fans. Supposedly this was John's way of telling the world that the Beatles were experimenting with LSD. Whether that may be true or not is open to debate. The song itself is I think one of the best song the Beatles ever done. Recorded in the point of their career when the Beatles had stopped touring and instead would go into the recording studio to experiment and expand on their musical talents. This was during that time the Beatles were transitioning their lives and music. ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is far cry from singing about wanting to Hold Your Hand or ""yeah, yeah, yeah"". This is a song with a swirling hodge podge of guitar riffs and sound effects with a heavy drum beat driving it. Certainly different from anything the Fab Fours fans had ever encountered. But if you are a fan of The Beatles this is a song to consider adding to your MP3 player along with many of their earlier hits.",1497830400,5

It just really ""hit that musical spot"" for me. The lyrics are pretty interesting, too. I've got high-end stereos in my home, and my vehicles. So, they really bring out the music, voice, and volume, so I can really jam to this song.",1498176000,5

6619,1761,1986,"When I was young, Nights in White Satin gave me more late night heebie-jeebies than any other song, with the possible exception of Gary Wright's 'Dream Weaver'. My Zenith clock radio with its glowing numbers would be the only light in my bedroom, and I would imagine all sorts of ghosts lurking in the corners or hanging around outside among the trees. A truly haunting, lonely piece of music.

It starts off quietly, with a flute and some strings and light glockenspiel or something. Then the gently strummed acoustic guitar and drums come in, followed by Justin Hayward's mournful vocals. An eerie mellotron enters the mix at 0:42. I love the mellotron, but wow, what a creepy sound. At 1:06 we get our first dose of the crying angel voices, time to grab my pillow and stick my head under the covers. Imagine Scrooge hearing those at the stroke of midnight. Yikes!

Another pass through verse and chorus and crying angels, then at 2:18 a big smack of the drum and we head into a gloomy flute solo, accompanied by acoustic guitar and more sad mellotron.

The night passes on, the moon drifts in the sky, the stars twinkle, clouds pass by, but the narrator does not sleep. He is suffering through the night, having many 'what does it all mean' thoughts: just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. The orchestra cranks it up at 3:50, the crying angels continue to torment us. At 4:35 the orchestra surrounds us with a wall of strings and horns as the narrator rolls around in bed, unable to shake free of doom and madness. At 4:57 we are allowed a brief moment of peace before it all shatters at 5:20 in piercing strings and alarmed horns. It is all too much, and the narrator soon loses consciousness.

At 5:38 he enters a dream state. There is a brief instant of silence, then the voice of Mike Pinder startles us at 5:54 with the spoken 'Late Lament': Breathe deep, the gathering gloom, watch lights fade from every room...this part would freak me out to no end. I love to imitate the British accent: cold hearted orb that rules the night. After this section, the strings and horns ascend to rage against the impending dawn, making one final stab at 7:00. The final gong at 7:07 signifies the appearance of the sun, and the long scary night is thankfully over.",1498176000,5

6629,1761,2934,"Consider the opening 0:51 of War Pigs. It explodes like a bomb hitting the ground in one of those WWII aerial films - simultaneous heavy guitar, bass and cymbal crash. While the chord sustains, a few more bombs are seen falling beneath us, through a grey sky towards a black and white city below. Listen to the guitar at 0:07, this kind of hammered-on note an octave above the root. It is like the sudden moment of impact, with the waves of destruction rippling outward. Away to the west, tanks crawl slowly across farm fields, prepared to blow away anything in their way. At 0:31 a warning siren in a nearby town calls for everyone to evacuate.

At 0:52 the pace quickens with sharp stabbing chords and pulse-quickening hi-hat. Ozzy Osbourne begins to sing at 1:03:

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses (or my preference, 'smell each other's stinky asses')

I like the double meaning of 'mass'. Similar to 'please please me' by The Beatles. The rest of Geezer Butler's lyrics are good, and it's a great anti-war song but, you know what? I've never liked Ozzy's voice all that much. That's all I'm going to say about it.

Tony Iommi plays fantastic guitar throughout: those triplets at 1:29, the trill at 1:34, the descending chords at 1:48, the little bend at 1:50, the chug and slash part from 2:08-2:17 and the riffs that accompany Politicians hide themselves away. Beginning at 3:30 he plays several solos that overlap until around 4:20. I love those pitch bends from 4:13-4:18. A very clever guitarist.

Bill Ward plays excellent drum fills everywhere, particularly at 1:38, 1:52, 1:57, 2:02 and on and on, through Iommi's solo, and 5:28-5:30. Geezer Butler holds it all down with his mighty bass playing.

The final 2:12 is a section called 'Luke's Wall'. It's a pretty cool way to end the song. Some great drums in this part, too. And bonus for me: no Ozzy.",1498176000,5

6644,1761,1070,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door. So much has been written about this song, you can find many online treatises that analyze its brilliance. I prefer to let it all wash over me like an oasis in the desert.",1498262400,5

6658,1761,1353,"The Who recorded this song. Who? Right. No, who? I can't believe they all urinated on that helpless concrete monolith. You boys should be ashamed of yourselves!

Who hasn't heard this song a zillion times? I don't know, who? No, they recorded it. Haha, never gets old does it. Groan. I still love it. I have fond memories of playing this song when I was young and my Mom would say, ""Oh there's that four year old again, banging on the organ. Where are the parents?""

Won't Get Fooled Again is an epic. It's one big Keith Moon drum fill, John Entwistle bass exploration, Pete Townsend guitar armada. Plus the amazing long organ parts at the beginning and in the middle (also played/programmed by Pete Townsend). Roger Daltrey's powerful vocals, and that wail at 7:45! One of the greatest wails ever recorded. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. What more is there to say, it's from the classic album Who's Next (with the classic urination cover), one of many fantastic albums released in 1971.",1498348800,5

6660,1931,139,"It's true. I can't think of another album that has a huge impact on rap/hip hop and the topped charts since then. It's been 14 years and way so many people still bob their heads and know the words to ""what up gangsta"" (which wasn't even a single!), ""in da club,"" ""wanksta,"" ""21 questions,"" ""many men,"" ""patiently waiting,"" etc. THIS is what makes a classic. Everything has to fall into place. It's not just, ""is every song good?"" It's more than that. It's the right artist at the right time with the right circumstances and attitude. 10 years down the line will people hear the songs And sing all the words?. People have been throwing around the term ""classic"" nowadays practically right when the album comes out. Nah man. Kendrick hasn't dropped a classic. Wayne never dropped one either. Nobody has put out anything like 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Trying. His story was crazy, his time dropping mix tapes as if they were albums was crazy. He was jacking beats like it was nothing and making dope songs. His confidence and sense of humor got people. Then, Eminem and Dre signed him and got right to work making this. Everything was just perfect looking back on it. Say what you want about him now lol but 50 dropped a certified banger and a classic that we'll always remember him by.",1498348800,5

6703,1456,2215,Neil Diamond has spanned generations of fans for decades.  Serenade was his 9th album and a continued beginning into areas he apparently wanted to pursue in broadening his talent.  I am thrilled he did.  This is one of my most treasured of his albums / cd's.  I have the vinyl of it as well and purchased that when it hit the street in 1974.  The CD is today's more flavorful version of that album and I treasure it just as much as the vinyl.  Many songs on the album have become my favorites over the years just as his early works for Bang Records put him as a mainstream entertainer so many years ago.  He is a master at his trade and this album is just a part of it.  Don't miss it ~ it's a Jewel !,1498521600,5
6704,1594,350,This flash in the pan of a hit certainly had its season in the sun. It had the uncommon combination of having a very cool usage of minor notes in combination with a refrain using major notes while wrapping it all around a heart breaker of a story. The song ushered in the early part of the seventies and in a sense is a time capsule item of that time period. I lost a classmate around the time it came out so the song had special force to it for me.,1498521600,5

This was done in the past with tracks such as Barrel of a Gun (released exactly two decades before this single) having a handful of remixes.  The first mix on this release is made to make the song sound almost like it came out much earlier as far back as the Violator era.  The other three drag on a bit.

6762,1594,884,"This is a fun little number by Harry Nilsson. Given Nilsson's tremendous vocal range, Coconut is not an impressive use of his abilities. The beauty of Coconut lies not in its complexity or talented performance but in the fact that it is a catchy tune that you just can't seem to forget. You will find yourself singing it or thinking about it because it is a song that elicits positive feelings. It is also a favorite to randomly tuck in a movie somewhere. Is it essential? Probably not but you should still have it.",1498780800,4
6763,1594,2952,"This is one of those one hit wonders from the band ""First Class"" which you probably have never heard of. In my opinion, ""Beach Baby"" is all you need to know about the band, ""First Class."" It is a fine pop tune, reminiscent of The Beach Boys and of that genre of music. It isn't a unique style of song, nor is it a great classic. Plain and simple, it is a tight pop song, well done, that makes you feel good regardless of what you are facing in life. It is one of those songs that kind of brings a smile to your spirits if not your face. It's a great tune to have for any 1970s  retro party. Don't put any thought into it.

It found its way into summer camps everywhere and its notes could be heard around campfires. It found its relevance when it became the theme song of the Billy Jack series of movies in the early seventies. For those of you not familiar with it, Billy Jack was a renegade hero of the marginalized Indians (now Native Americans) on reservations. Billy Jack defended them against the abuse of racist local officials. Billy Jack is in the dustbins of cinema history but One Tin Soldier continues to call  humanity to task for placing greed ahead of people. A worthy song, indeed.",1498780800,5
6766,1594,539,"This was, in my opinion, the greatest hit of the ""Lovin' Spoonful.""  Summer In The City has an over the top catchy tune with cascading notes that build in volume with each round. It has a bit of bite and raw edge to it not found in other Lovin' Spoonful songs. There is no other song like it in their repertoire.

This is classic middle Beatles in their prime and it totally kills it from guitar licks, simple but effective and perfectly timed vocals and harmonies. It used a hit formula that was emulated by many bands contemporary to them. The Beatles' name endured but most of their tributes fell into the dustbins of history. So influential was this simple but rocking song that it has even been relegated to the blasphemy of being put to orchestral sounds and played in elevators.

6859,1973,2977,"Pros: Cool unplugged versions of Avril classics; rare; raw

Cons: Just and E.P., maybe a little too short in my opinion

Last night I was watching Avril Lavigne have a prank pulled on her on the MTV show Punk'd.  She was crying because she was so scared.  I guess she ain't so tough, is she?  Yeah, no matter how many middle fingers she'd like to flash at cameras and in general, she's just really a harmless pussycat.  Still she has an image to put forth, no matter how silly it may seem.  I have to resign myself to the fact that just about anyone's music I listen to is going to disappoint me on a personal level, whether it is religion, politics, middle fingers, or anything else.  It's hard to separate the music from the a--hole, but if we're going to be fans of music then it's a necessity.

Almost six years ago to the day, Avril released this EP as an exclusive to Target.  It consists of six songs that mainly promote her Under My Skin CD's best songs, which was released a little over a month before.  The music was recorded live during a Canadian mall tour, dubbed the Live and By Surprise tour.  These days, of course it's impossible to find this CD available at Target stores, so if you decided you would need one too, you'd have to go to eBay and Amazon and pick it up for a pretty decent price.

He Wasn't starts off the CD, and it sounds like a rough recording taken from the soundboard.  This is not to say that it doesn't sound fantastic, because it does.  Her voice has no effects, the guitars sound effectively pure and the mix makes for a really nice sounding CD.  Her band consisted of just her and best friend/then-guitarist Evan Taubenfeld on two acoustic guitars and with Evan helping with the backing vocals.  The two perform a convincing unplugged version of these new songs, although Avril's vocal sounds relatively lethargic and void of the emotion compared to the original.  The audience can be heard a bit in the background, which help the songs have a slightly fuller sound.  He Wasn't is originally a hard rock/pop song with loud guitars, but they make it work, as they make sure they harmonize on the vocals in all the right spots.

My favorite song off of Under My Skin was My Happy Ending.  It has such addictive hooks and the lyrics were terrifically inspired.  Evan's harmony is out of key once or twice, but it still has an endearing quality to it.  The unplugged version is pretty much a carbon copy of the heavier original, except performed with acoustic guitars.  She goes back to her first album, Let Go only once and tackles Sk8ter Boi, which unlike My Happy Ending is pretty different from the original, especially the intro.  The audience doesn't even know what song it is until Avril begins singing the first lines  He was a boy, she was a girl...  On the back of the CD, it says that this track was from 2003, I suppose that maybe this was performed at another mall tour.

Don't Tell Me may work better as an acoustic number.  The guitar work between Evan and Avril in the intro sounds inspired as if the song's genesis was possibly born on these very two acoustic guitars.  Avril's vocal always sounds effortlessly splendid, and this is no exception, but here on Don't Tell Me she added the necessary emotional factor to effectively get this track across in the live atmosphere.  I tend to get a bit miffed at Avril all over again when I hear her perform this song as well as My Happy Ending.  These two singles are edited for radio because you never know who is listening, plus FCC laws prohibit.  I think she should have applied the same edited version when performing these songs in a public place like the mall for goodness sakes.  I know you're thinking, come on scapp70, it's only the a-word and the s-word.  I still find it inappropriate to hear these words amplified in your local mall.  If I was there with my son, I know I would have been pretty pissed off.

Take Me Away was not released as one of the singles from Under My Skin, but it's still one of the fan favorites.  Nobody's Home was the third single released, and it's my second favorite from the Under My Skin album, but my favorite from the Acoustic Live EP.  Many singers do not try and tackle the falsetto voice in a live setting, as it could sound weak, and it's a bit easier to go off-key when using it.  Avril's use of it gives her an exposed feel, and it shows a sweeter side of the artist.  She has a beautiful falsetto, one that rivals great singer's such as Olivia Newton-John even in her heyday.  I wish she would use it more, but then again her style of music doesn't call for it much.

This is not Avril's only EP by the way.  She had made two others, one for each studio album.  The first one from 2003 is called Angus Drive EP, which featured four songs, and the last one was called Control Room - Live EP that contains six tracks, including Sk8ter Boi again and a Sarah McLachlan cover called Adia.  So far, this is the only one I've collected and it's very cool to own this in addition/companion to her studio album.  If you're a fan of Avril Lavigne music, like me, you'll enjoy having alternative versions of the songs you already like on hand.

Cons: Free, maybe All The Critics too.

1999 was Prince's first US Top Ten album. It is his fifth release, and it has gone on to sell around ten million copies worldwide. This is Prince's 1982 breakthrough album that launched him into the big time and started him on the path to super-stardom, as his mega smash Purple Rain album and movie were his next musical moves two years later in 1984.

 For this album, Prince renamed his band Prince and the Revolution in lieu of the go it alone Prince that his first four albums toted. His first four albums sold modestly well, breaking into the top 40 twice, and his singles did even worse, besides his one hit I Wanna Be Your Lover from his second album, Prince from 1979.
 On his first four albums, Prince could really only be heard singing in his soulful falsetto. The 1999 album is the first where he sings full-throated on every song.

 The opening song is the title track, 1999. The song reached a very respectable #12 in the US singles charts, and even better in the R&B and Dance singles charts. The song is kind of divided up vocally in the same way Stevie Wonder had done with You Are the Sunshine of My Life. First voice you hear is that of keyboardist, Lisa Coleman, then guitarist Dez Dickerson sings the next line, and then Prince will sing the third song. On the fourth line they will all harmonize together. The beat is a rock/dance mix set to apocalyptic lyrics about the New Year's Eve 1999, the last day we humans will be alive because of the imminent cold war destruction we face in the year 2000. Prince declares he will live life to the fullest during this last year, and especially on that fateful day of New Year's Eve. Prince's 1982 idea of living life is having sex and dancing to his own music. That ideology is the basis for the whole album actually, so this opening track makes the perfect choice for title track.

1999 quietly segues into Prince's first Top Ten hit, Little Red Corvette, reaching #6 in the US Pop singles charts. The song has crossed over into classic status. Once in a while I'll even hear it on a classic rock station. This is one of Prince's most well-known songs, his inclusion of the song in the acoustic segment of his Musicology tour was a highlight. The song is very pop rock, not really a dance song at all. The guitar solo provided by Dez is good, but not Prince caliber. When Dez left after this album, Prince mostly handled all of the guitar solos himself. Dez could be seen in Prince's first film Purple Rain performing at First Avenue.

 Prince had another top ten hit with the next song Delirious. The song reached number 8 in the US Pop singles charts. When I first heard the song, I thought it was too silly and poppy for my tastes. The song quickly grew on me, it's so much fun to sing along and tap a toe to. It's the shortest song on the album clocking in at only 4 minutes. The song has a loopy wavy keyboard riff that commands you to get silly. Even though it's silly time with Prince, the song is as addictive as any of the great songs on this album.

Let's Pretend We're Married is one of my favorites. The fast drumbeat and artificial bass is the backdrop for deliberately slow melody line sung by Prince. The song is very upbeat, poppy and happy - so the erotic lyrics are sort of camouflaged by the song's happy mood.
 Even the ""f"" word is uttered more than once in this song, but it's all in fun - in a 1982 sort of way. This was also released as a single, but it couldn't break the top 40 on any of the US singles charts, stalling at #52 in the Pop Singles charts.

Now, there's no hiding the fact that D.M.S.R. is just down right the nastiest song on the album. The song has a deep and raw bass and bass synthesizer that crank up the funk factor to 11. The keyboards and guitars accent the bass and lyrics masterfully. The song is a dance party, and the fact that the song lasts over eight minutes it will last for a good part of it. The lyrics demand participation...

 It took me a while to buy the CD for 1999, even though it is such a great album. I held on to my double vinyl album for a while because the single CD released was missing a song, D.M.S.R., because CDs were only 75 minutes back then. When CDs were manufactured with a slightly longer running time at 80 minutes, 1999 was re-released. I always wondered who was the genius who chose to leave off D.M.S.R. instead of a lesser song.

 Speaking of lesser songs, Free is thrown into the middle of the album song list, and it really destroys the whole idea that this is a perfect album. It's not the song is awful; it's just not good enough to be appreciated amongst the rest of the other songs. It's a piano ballad, and it has a couple of slight hooks, but it just doesn't work. This is a smutty, sexual dance, rock funk album, and Free just doesn't go with that flow.

 Speaking of smutty sex songs, Automatic is one of the best. The lyrics are what do it for me, they're honest and bare. They talk about raw feelings about obsession, lust and desperation.  The song runs almost ten minutes long, it's hypnotically amazing, and sometimes it seems too short, believe it or not. The song has an intoxicatingly beat that refuses to deviate, but the melody on top of it changes here and there throughout the song. The song has many parts, yet still with that single beat, it's a great effect. This song is epic, and is surely one of those deep cuts, those rare Prince songs that not too many people know, but if and when they stumble upon it, it's like a buried treasure filled with riches.

Automatic and Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) were always like sister songs to me. They don't sound alike, but the sexually erotic and desperate honest theme is rampant in both songs. The sixteenth note high-hat is constant, and again Prince deliberately sings at a much slower pace against the super fast high-hat. The lyrics tend to be about self-evaluation, since he is not getting the response from women he thinks he should be getting. The song has a very high emotive quality, especially in the parts where Prince screeches those amazing screams that only he can do. Lots of echo and in these two songs add to the erotic ambience of these last two songs effectively. These both are my favorite two songs on the album.

Lady Cab Driver is probably as smutty as Prince gets on this album, complete with squeaking bed sounds and all. Prince wears his falsetto voice again for the most part of this song. The Revolution delivers a very groovy and funky beat. The verses of this song sort of remind me of Tom Tom Club's first album. The story of the lyrics is about Prince hailing a taxi and at the end of the ride making love to the cab driver. While he's doing her, he spews his frustrations orally as well as sexually.

All the Critics Love U in New York is just a little bit better than Free. It's another big funk fest of bass and drums, but the melody line is uninspired and falls flat. It's too bad, because there's some real good bass playing here.

 The CD ends with International Lover. This song has a classic slow Motown type of groove, with funky smut lyrics. Prince is your pilot, and watch out when your board, because Prince is not only going to fly you to another country, but he'll rock your world. The plane is called the Seduction 747, again it sounds corny, but it works I suppose because only someone like Prince can pull a song like this off. This Prince song may have crossed the line; this is more like the Prince on Saturday Night Live portrayed by the hilarious Fred Armisen.

The album is a big dance party, yet eclectic. It rocks pretty hard when it tries, yet has some corny moments. It is the perfect predecessor for Prince's next venture which was Purple Rain. It is a new beginning after the first four albums. It's the beginning of the Prince career we all loved for a little while there in the 80s, and the snippets of genius we see even today by his recent released. It's the start of all things purple lyrically and visually. This is a great place to begin your exploration of Prince knowledge. If you need to learn about the earlier stuff, get the 1993 greatest compilation called The Hits/B-Sides, it pretty much sums it up.

 Pop/Country mega star Taylor Swift had really hit it big right from the debut. Her first album Taylor Swift was released in 2006, and has been in the Top 200 since. In 2008, Taylor had been hard at work getting her new album Fearless out in time for the fall, but her fans kept requesting some new music. Unlike every other music artist, Swift obliged with this EP, Beautiful Eyes. Its a six-track CD that includes two new songs, one rare bonus track and three reworked favorites from her debut. If this wasn't enough, she included a bonus DVD with videos for every song on the CD (except for I Heart ?) plus the remaining two promotional videos from Taylor Swift, and more and all at a very low price. Of course these days, the price had risen substantially as Taylor only wanted a certain number of discs released, making this EP now a very sought after rarity.

 The CD starts off with the title track Beautiful Eyes, a light pop song flavored to country perfection. Admittedly, these are not the best lyrics from Swift, but the atmospheric pedal steel guitar makes up for the rushed lyrics. It took me a few listens before I fell in love with the track but eventually Taylors femininely soft vocals combined with the magical ambiance finally seeped into my soul. Its one of her oldest songs, as she performed this song live in 2005, a year before her debut was released. Shouldve Said No (alternate version) is a different version than the one that is found on her debut. This version is shorter by about twenty seconds and the electric guitars are stripped away, leaving the skeleton of the more country version.

 Easily, the best song from this EP is Teardrops On My Guitar (Acoustic Version). This is also from her debut album, and here we have a slightly shorter version, yet with only Taylors voice alone with a single acoustic guitar gives it a much more intimate feel. The lyrics kind of run along the same storyline that her future smash single You Belong With Me travels on. Picture To Burn is the last from her debut album. This says that this version is the radio edit. I cant really decipher the difference between the two versions. They are basically the same to my ears; perhaps the production is a bit tinnier which would be friendly for the radio format. This song is upbeat and the heaviest song on this EP, Taylors lyrics are a bit more venomous than usual towards the boy in question, and her faux southern accent is even raised in all of her womanly ire.

 Taylor has released three full-length albums so far, and even since the very beginning she struck some exclusive deals with different stores like Target or Wal-Mart and give her fans a choice between what kind of bonus material would be tacked on the end of her album on the bonus disc. Taylors always writing songs, so most of the time shell give the fans newly recorded music as bonus material. The best of these is the bonus songs on her Fearless album, the Platinum Edition where the bonus tracks outshined the album itself. The next song, Im Only Me When Im With You is one of the bonus songs from Taylor Swift. This is the most country song out of the bunch here, with fiddles blazing right up front along with pedal steel and banjo. The last song I Heart ?, on the CD is possibly the oldest here, written when she was just 14. The lyrics are about a relationship break-up once again, but Im not sure I understand the I Heart ? reference she makes in the chorus. If her ex can see that she had written I Heart ? on the back of her hand, then she wins. I write a question mark on the back of my brain because Im not sure how or what she wins here, but it ultimately doesnt matter because the song is an excellent way to end the CD.

 So while Taylor gives us almost a twenty-minute EP, the DVD is nearly an hour. It contains all of the promotional videos from her debut album, including Tim McGraw and Our Song. We go behind the scenes with the making of the Picture To Burn video. For the video of Beautiful Eyes, we have a compilation of video snippets from Taylors birthday party, where Kellie Pickler makes a starring appearance in the video. I love that she included the GAC (Great American Country) channel special about herself being featured in the New Artist special, and she included about fifteen minutes of that. Last but not least is her performance of Shouldve Said No taken from the Academy of Country Music Award show from 2008, which was probably the most recent thing at the time of this release.

 Not only does Taylor give us quality stuff, but also in this case a huge quantity of entertainment for her fans, and I am one of them. This CD usually goes for a lot, but I knew I had to get it. I was lucky enough to get it for under $15, but if you are as big a fan as I am, and you don't have this, it is worth it to even pay double if you have to. Taylor is an amazing artist and probably the best song writer around today, I cant wait to see what she gives us next.

I was a senior that year and it was everywhere. Soon after that they flooded the market with ""Sarah Smile"" which all of us were humming.

The song features opera chorus music and innovative choral arrangements not usually found in a Rock N Roll format. The timing is magnificent and when the electric guitars enter the scene they really cut loose with wild abandon with ferocious vocals to boot. This is a great song that I sometimes stop to appreciate. Because it got so much play, I actually avoided the song for awhile but today I find myself able to enjoy it anew.

It's like a post card for their 12 Salt Lake City fans. It's just awesome with its diverse instrumentation of baritone saxes,keys and xylophones.""Girls Don't Tell Me"" is a Carl led (a rarity at the time) guitar led Beatles esque acoustic number with driving rhythm's that remind one of ""Help"" and ""Rubber Soul"". While the melody is decent enough, the song sounds unfinished and is not really all that great. ""Help Me Rhonda"" is one of those classic early Beach Boy singles like ""I Get Around"" that stick in your head forever. ""California Girls"" is mind blowing.

6936,1988,2993,"Eh, this is not Mr. Connick Jr at his best - ceding creative control to outside producers/collaborators isn't necessarily a bad idea... but in this case the results, which try to place Harry in a more contemporary setting, are often too generic and bland. By the way, if you're looking for the crooner stuff that he does so well, this probably isn't your record. Might've worked better had Connick stuck with Eg White for the entire record, instead of splitting production duties with Butch Walker. The Walker tracks, recorded with a full band lineup, are more conventional. It's on the White-produced tracks that Harry steps outside his comfort zone.

There are nice moments - including the worthy hooks in the exuberant album opener ""(I Like It When You) Smile"" and the adventurous closer, ""Right Where It Hurts."" Other highlights: the laid-back ""(I Do) Like We Do"" and ""Tryin' To Matter."" It's just that some of the weaker moments could've benefited from more of the energy Connick brings to his ""poppier"" albums. Connick does display his underappreciated versatility throughout, adding his own drumming and horn playing to his usual keys.

There's a retailer-specific version that contains two exclusive bonus tracks - both of which are better that several cuts on the main album (including the title track which, yes, we not included on the standard edition). I didn't realize this originally, which led me to buy the album twice! Glad I did because ""That Would Be Me"" and ""You'll Be Back"" are great tunes.",1499817600,3

It seems like they have tried to go another route, or are tired of each other, or who knows why they changed their sound, but the songs have lost that rock edge that I've loved so much in so much of their other music.  I know that most people prefer the pop-ish songs like Kryptonite, but for me I love songs like Down Poison, which have a distinctively darker edge.  This album is missing that.

6965,906,3003,"An essential Beach Boys purchase. A fantastic jawl dawg sneeeshhhtt set First of all, the remastering is fantastic. Way better than the 2001ish 2fers and on par with the 2011ish mono and stereo remasters. A lot of their albums are only available still in the early 2000's inferior sounding 2fers, so this is the only way to get a large portion of the catalog with sufficient remastering. There are also a number of great rarities and an overall very good song selection for the most part. A great book, and there is really nothing not to like here other than a handful of song choices, which is impossible not to happen and with that considered its a great choice. Right from the beginning the BB's are choice. ""Surfin"" the first single, is fantastic early R & R. Mike Love really shines here and on ""Surfin Safari"". Also Dennis Wilson's punky drums are super fun and compact. Clearly its great Brian expanded the Beach Boys and started using far more advanced chords and harmony, and of course the Wrecking Crew. Both versions are great, even if the real, real early days were limited in some ways technically, at there best are great in their way. ""Lonley Sea"" from ""Surfin USA"" album is the first song by Brian Wilson that is pointing the direction to ""Pet Sounds"". The next track to do so, is the fantastic ""In My Room"". Some of the early songs could be considered chessy but their is almost always some sort of strange brilliance bringing them closer to quirky art than generic cheese. Case in point; ""Be True to your School"". ""Catch a Wave"" is probably my favorite of the early surfing songs. Brian's ""Cause you don't just have to put it down"" in falsetto is classic. The fact these guys couldn't surf. really adds a great dorky art pop side to things, that make these songs more about an energy or vibe around the idea of the beach and surfin, rather than songs for people who actually surf. They also made song car songs In addition to the California style beach related songs. After Brian Wilsons nervous breakdown on an airplane in 1964, he stayed home to work on music while the boys were on tour. This of course is the halcyon years of the Beach Boys. ""Summer Days and Summer Nights"" and ""Today!"" the first two albums with Brian at home, and using the Wrecking Crew far far more than before are filled with sneeeshhtt dawgs classics. The LSD extravaganza ""California Girls"" with its amazing introduction and heavenly background vocals on the second verse are legendary. ""Salt Lake City"" is another one of those really akward/cringe worthy sets of lryics that are completely redeemed by the music, arrangement and performance. ""Let Him Run Wild"" was Dennis Wilson's favorite Beach Boys song of all time (at least at the time of the 1976ish interview I saw) and it's fantastic Brian meets wrecking crew slow burn jawl pop dawg song. ""Help Me Rhonda"" is Alan Jardine big single to sing. ""Today!"" is looking towards ""Pet Sounds"" far more"". ""Please Let Me Wonder"" is one Brians very best vocal performances ever and ""She Knows Me Too Well"" is another song in the tender tradition of pre ""Pet Sounds"" tender Brian songs like ""Lonley Sea"", ""In My Room"" and ""Warmth of the Sun"". Dennis really starts coming into his own a lead singer with ""Do You Wanna Dance?"" and especially with the underatted ""In the Back of my Mind"". The latter is one of the most complicated pre Sounds/Smile Beach Boys songs and Dennis gets to sing lead, and he sounds great (you must check out his solo album ""Pacific Ocean Blue"" from Jawl 70's). Of course at this point comes ""Pet Sounds"" and we all know about jawl. ""Smile"" comes next and you all know bout jawl dawg. There aren't any songs from ""Smiley Smile"" here from what I can remember and if that is indeed the case, its kind of a shame because it should atleast be represented by a song or two, like ""Little Pad"". Actually ""Wonderful"" is from ""Smiley Smile"", not what I would have chose to represent jawl albums. 'Wild Honey"" is next and is well represented and contains first time ever stereo mixes. The full album is now released in stereo in the recent 2 cd release ""1967"" (recommended dawgs). Its a fun album, and does away the Wrecking Crew and you can hear that's its the boys playing said jawl instruments, sometimes for worse, sometimes for the better"".  I would have liked them to include the Belle & Sebastian proto track ""Arent You Glad"", but o well. The underatted 1968 album ""Friends"" is next. An extended ""Meant for You"" is included. its effect is quite different from its orginal length around 1 minute. Not that its much longer, but its extra length is interesting, if not sneeshhtt essential. ""Busy Doing Nothing"" is Brian's bossa nova song, that really shows his state of mind and life style at the time. Stating with ""Smiley Smile"" Brian wasn't really singing lead as the only lead singer. There starts to be a lot of Mike singer a line, Brian sings a build up line, then Carl sings the chorus (like ""Arent You Glad"" for examples jawl),so ""Busy Doing Nothing"" is a bit of rarity for the time, a full on Brian song - that could have been on a solo album at the time. A classic. At the time of ""Friends, Brian, seems to be in a decent enough frame of mind. It's kind of a mysterious time. It's a little undocumented and kind of forgotten unfortunately. ""20/20"" is next with the jawl proto sneeeshht attempt of 'Do it Again"". Its a successful attempt at another ""Catch a Wave"" type of song, even with Brian falsetto on chorus. continued jawl latters dawgs boi boi.",1499990400,5

I have not taken notes on which ones I liked or disliked because I simply do not have the time or patience. I will say that fans of this conductor, as I am, even with misgivings about individual performances, will enjoy this pianist/conductor's usual individualistic mixture of often powerful straightforward musicality and willful, eccentric quirks that have kept his recordings since adolescence so interesting, whether he flops, scores or, more often, provides a mix.

So, I have loved Loreena Mckinnett for years, and this album is another one of my long standing favorites.  She has a beautiful, ethereal voice.  Her music is evocative and passionate and soothing all at the same time.  I love the infusion of poetry in her lyrics. I haven't heard a single thing of hers I haven't loved.

Soft with a quiet invitation at the end of each line, until the final two or three (dance with Jesus, Fly to Jesus). We have many seniors in our church, many over 80, and most will say they never guessed they would live this many years. A song like this may be good for them to reflect over their life. We'll see. Probably the only negative with this song in this day and time is it does NOT repeat a phrase over and over. If you aren't paying attention the first time the words are sung, you'll miss it.

Roger Daltrey's  vocals are shown off at their best in this song which was actually written by Pete Townsend. It reached 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was one of those songs that was better than its ranking on Billboard. Lyrically, it is the song of a desperate man at the end of his rope with the rain bringing special meaning that saves his life.

7196,906,3055,"1971 was a very interesting time in the Beach Boys career. The counterculture that an album like ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smiley Smile"" helped usher in was still very much alive (and would be peaking until the end of 1972ish) but the Beach Boys were only really commercially viable in Europe and especially England were their newer materially was appreciated. Their previous album ""Sunflower"" was a critical success and mostly a fantastic album but debuted at something like #190 on the US charts (still kind of shocks me). They needed Brian's name to make a push for US interest but at the same time Brian, while still musically active was the Brian of old - his ear wasn't tuned to the charts and whatever he produced was most likely going to be highly un- commercial. This point is really the crux of the issue. The Boys and especially Mike Love want Brian, but only a certain type of Brian..ie..Don't get to weird! In 1971, I think their best bet was to tell Brian; ""Brian do what you want, anything! we are behind you a 100%!"" and then market it as Brian unchained. Well that's sort of what happened, but it was fighting all along the way. ""A Day in the Life of a Tree"", ""Till I Die"" and ""Surf's Up"" are a very dark and emotially challenging music for a band that less than a decade ago was singing great songs about fun in the sun. ""A Day in the life of a Tree"" is about exacly what the title says, although one could be tempted to think it was also about Brian's state of mind at the time. Wonderfully sung by at the time manager Jack Riley (with Van Dyke Parks of Smile fan in lead background vocals towards the end) its a great song and seagues perfectally into the more famous ""Till I Die"". Carl decided to finish ""Surf's Up"" which at the time was a stroke of critical and commercial genius as calling the album ""Surf's Up"" after the famed ""Smile"" song was likely the reason why this album got into the top 30 on the US charts. It's interesting hearing this version with Carl singing lead for the first half, up to ""Dove nested towers"", when the 1966/67 Brian takes over. Now we have a complete version with Brian on lead vocals from 2011's ""The Smile Sessions"" so its lessens the impact of the version here somewhat (although it's in stereo which adds something) but I try to think of how amazing it must have sounded when the album first came out. The ""Child is the Father of the Man"" contrapuntal choral at the end is one of the all time best Beach Boy moments. It's interesting the gave Alan Jardine the lead line during the choral and he does a fantastic job of singing; ""A Children's Song..."" Which brings me to Alan Jardine's input on the album. Alan has often been in the background with the Beach Boys, simply adding to their vocal blend and some rhythm guitar/misc. instruments here and there. For their last album ""Sunflower"", Alan was hardly given any spotlight. Here he sings a funky lead vocal line on ""Don't Go Near the Water"", most of ""Take a Load Off Your Feet"", ""Looking at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song) and the aforementioned climax of ""Surf's Up"". It's quite a big step up in prescense on this album for Alan. ""Looking at Tomorrow"" in particular I find seagues perfectly between ""Feel Flows"" and ""Day in the Life of a Tree"". It's a fantastic deeply psychedelic folk song with amazing phasing/flanging all over the track. Bruce Johnston bings the amazing ""Disney Girls"" which, no matter how annoying Bruce has been over the years, or how random/pointless/dorky he seems later on, he brought this song, which is just beautiful. Carl's ""Long Promised Road"" and ""Feel Flows"" are Carl breaking out as a fanastic song write. ""Feel Flows"" with it's mystic jazz flute/guitar/sax soloing is a favorite of mine. Up to this point of the review this album is largey perfect. Sure ""Take a Load Off Your Feet"" is bizarre, and a little unsettling but there's a lot to like about the track including Brian's lead vocals starting off the song (an increasing rarity at this point) and the violin at the end. Dennis's absence on this album really takes the album down. After 4 songwriting credits on ""Sunflower"", he really became a presence on a Beach Boys album, which he had been forahwile for varying degrees at this point. When you hear ""Wouldn't it be Nice to Live Again"" from the ""Surf's Up"" sessions, I wonder ""how in the HELL was this not put on the album!!?"" it would have easily been a highlight. The album is on 34 minutes and could have used it to pad out the run time. It wasn't completed from what I've read, but listening to it on ""Made in California"" box set, I think its easily finished enough to be on the album. O yea, ""Student Demonstration Time"" which is probably Mike Love's first true WTF moment (there would be many). It's a rewrite of  ""Riot in Cell Block 9"" with new lryics from Mike Love. Mike Love's biggest moment on ""Sunflower"" was the amazing proto dream pop ""All I Wanna Do"", and on this album he really doesn't follow that mid album showcase all that well. The song was performed well enough with enough bluesy umph to make it likeable enouh has an akward lryric refrain and really sounds entirely out of place on this album or any Beach Boys album. If Dennis's had a couple songs in place or in addition to that one it would have helped. Still a legendary abum that's easy to listen to all the way through over and over again. I recommend buying the mp3 ""Wouldn't it be Nice to Live Again"" from the ""Made in California"" box set to complete the album better or to replace ""Student Demonstration Time"" depending on how you feel about the track.",1500595200,4

7316,1185,3072,"At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.

I am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals. The sound quality on this CD isn't the best either. Sorry, cant recommend this.",1501200000,2

7339,2095,3080,"I stumbled upon ""100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces"" while browsing the digital music section at Amazon.com. I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a ""try-before-I-buy"" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.

This may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.

Every one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the ""St. Matthew Passion"" and St. John Passion"" especially lethargic and monotonous.

There are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Bach-2CDs/dp/B000W0B1CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Bach (2CDs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-x-Bach/dp/B00P3CEUXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 x Bach</a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.

Bottom line: ""100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces"" is a non-starter at any price. Not recommended.",1501200000,1

Carried it in my head during TET of 68 (Pleiku.) Strange how tunes bring up old places and feelings. Stationed at West Point NY in 69.

However, if you are new to Jefferson Airplane this is a good starting point.

7394,1083,3083,"Alicia Bridgess represents the glory days of disco the1970. if you don't know that era you should learn about it because disco produced a lot of good music that is still worth listening to. This song is about a love relationship that broke up , and about going on with your life. this theme is ageless and applies to all of us. You may have heard Janis Ian's At Seventeen, well this is the disco version of that song. Relationships come and go and we need the strength to go on with our life. Alicia is as good as the Bee Gees.

After 6 long years and a lot of turmoil, Slipknot returned with an amazing album that sounds like a combination of everything that came before it. It combines the aggression of Iowa, the melody of Vol. 3 and the complexity of All Hope is Gone. While there is no bad Slipknot album, I would say this is their second best right behind Iowa.

Frankly I heard a portion of this song while partially listening to something my spouse was watching but it was enough to have me listen to a sample and then purchase the MP3.

They're angry, but at what is unclear. Or maybe they're just playing us.

They are artists , they do whatever the f they want. It's fresh.
Yet, are they serious? I don't think so.
I think they create the drama for the hell of it.
Because the music speaks for itself.
They know they're good and by creating a cult of not giving a f, we are left curious.
So the music...it's the most powerful you hear this year. Guaranteed.

7468,617,3096,"While Randy Newman is a musical household name in 2017 - especially with his glorious Oscar-winning Soundtrack work on beloved Pixar films like ""Toy Story"", ""Monsters Inc."" and more - back in 1972 when he was onto his 4th solo LP for Reprise Records (3rd studio set) - and despite huge industry wide critical acclaim - he couldn't get arrested by the buying public even if he did insult short people or rail against the tyranny of religious zealots.

Originally released in May 1972 - the American vinyl LP of Reprise MS 2064 was not only ignored but even derided in some sectors - something Newman alludes to and smirks at in the caustic liner notes that accompany this stunning 2002 Rhino CD reissue. Because of course history tells us a different story to the chart indifference he suffered then - ""Sail Away"" is a great album - a masterpiece really - and an early jewel in a very large and long career arc. He is also helped by an impressive array of session players - Ry Cooder, Chris Etheridge of The Flying Burrito Brothers, Jimmy Bond, Wilton Felder of The Crusaders and Milt Holland to name but a few (Randy plays piano and sings). It's lonely at the top indeed. Here are the memos from Simon Smith and his Amazing Dancing Bear...

UK released May 2002 - ""Sail Away"" by RANDY NEWMAN on Rhino/Reprise 8122-78244-2 (Barcode 081227824426) is an 'Expanded Edition' CD Remaster of the 12-Track 1972 LP with Five Previously Unreleased Bonus Tracks and plays out as follows (41:51 minutes):

1. Sail Away [Side 1]
2. Lonely At The Top
3. He Gives Us All His Love
4. Last Night I Had A Dream
5. Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear
6. Old Man
7. Political Science [Side 2]
8. Burn On
9. Memo To My Son
10. Dayton, Ohio - 1903
11. You Can Leave Your Hat On
12. God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)
Tracks 1 to 12 are his 4th album ""Sail Away"" (3rd studio set) - released May 1972 in the USA on Reprise MS 2064 and July 1972 in the UK on Reprise K 44185.

BONUS TRACKS (Previously Unreleased):
13. Let It Shine
14. Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong (Studio Version)
15. Dayton, Ohio - 1903 (Early Version)
16. You Can Leave Your Hat On (Demo)
17. Sail Away (Early Version)

The 20-page booklet is a pleasingly in-depth affair with a Page 3 introduction from the great songsmith himself and a further essay/assessment pleasantly called ""Of Freaks, Geeks, And God"" by Editor of the Rolling Stone  DAVID WILD. There is even some personalized notes on the five Previously Unreleased outtakes and how pleased Randy is with the sound of the new Remaster carried out by long-time Rhino Records Audio Engineer associate - DAN HERSCH. This is a gorgeous sounding CD reissue - warm and full - as this quietly subdued album has always cried out for.

""...In America you get food to eat...Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet...You'll just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day..."" You can't really imagine (even now) the impact those opening lyrics to ""Sail Away"". Firstly very few artists would have risked them. Newman isn't casually slagging off America or taking a cheap shot - but he is highlighting hypocrisies and attacking homegrown racists and their simplistic crap all in the same song. The fact that he does all this inside a haunting melody (orchestration conducted by Louis Kauffman) is all the more remarkable. Newman then digs at his own supposed Rock Star lifestyle in ""Lonely At The Top"" - the applause - the money  the after parties. The song was used as a title to a CD Best Of for Warner Brothers in 1987 remastered by Lee Herschberg  a disc I bought back in early days of reissue.

An uncaring God and our blind allegiance to pie-in-the-sky indoctrination crops up in the sly and disturbing ""He Gives Us All His Love"". The distinctive rattle of Ry Cooder's slide guitar strings comes slinking in on ""Last Night I Had A Dream""  a song I only half like actually. Speaking of which - his Alan Price hit ""Simon Smith And The Amazing Dancing Bear"" dates back to the Sixties and put RN on the songwriting map. But again - I've always admired the song more than I actually liked it. ""Old Man"" is one of the saddest melodies on the album - a tearful farewell by a son to his father - a Dad he clearly dislikes and loves in equal measure.

Side 2 gives us the masterful ""Political Science"" - a song with lyrics that inspire awe and giggles even now  a full 45 years after they were released. The protagonist singer tells of American Generals and Politicians weary of trying to be nice to the world  why bother man - they hate all Americans anyhow. So to Hell with them all and let's drop the big one now (not on Australia though - don't want to hurt no Kangaroo - besides they've got surfing and good weather too). ""Burn On"" is one of the album's secret nuggets - a river in Cleveland suddenly containing magical qualities as a red moon of fire rises in the distance. Understated observation number 424 comes in the shape of ""Memo To My Son"" - as witty and as wise a love letter from a father to a son as you'll ever hear. Like most young Dads - he's struggling with all the joys and terrors a child brings - but there's a simple love in there that's so touching. In the liner notes Newman's fairly dismissive of ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" but I actually think it's beautiful - a mournful 'missus and me' ballad. The ever so slightly perverse ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" tickled many people's fancy (Tom Jones even covered it for ""The Full Monty"" film) - and it's easy to work out why as it plays - the song is witty, acidic and lusty. Buddhists and Hindus join Catholics and Jews on Satellite TV for the seriously harsh ""God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind)""  a nonchalant even disinterested Almighty poo-pooing his creation Mankind as they beg for mercy from plagues and suffering.

You can't help thinking that the wonderful outtake ""Let It Shine"" was left off the album precisely because it is so upbeat and uplifting - not in keeping with the album's overall moody demeanor. But it's a treat to hear it and ""Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong"" - fully formed songs that actually deserve the moniker 'Bonus'. As I already liked ""Dayton, Ohio - 1903"" - a pretty 'early version' of it is alright by me. And the early version of the title song is radically different and fascinating for it...

""...I hope people like them this time..."" - Randy Newman remarks in the new liner notes (the next LP ""Good Ole Boys"" from 1974 was also reissued in this CD series) - maybe a little mellowed by the years and distance. I'd agree.

I know RN is not everyone's cup of Darjeeling - but his songmanship and affecting melodies/lyrics warrant your attention  yes even deserve it. And 1972's forgotten and overlooked ""Sail Away"" album is the perfect starting point...",1501718400,5

Can I call Drive By Truckers the best band working in the USA today? Nominate anyone else you want to, but Im gonna declare DBT the winners anyway. Theyve been through several lineup shuffles over the past decade or so, but the band does indeed keep on truckin, thanks to the outstanding songs of Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. and their unabashed love of playing music

This 3-CD set, culled from recent live shows, the band in top form. Factor in their deft musical chops (including some very impressive guitar playing), Hoods sometimes funny and often passionate between-song story-telling, and some fierce versions of many of their best-known songs, and you have a powerful live album. If you're a DBT fan, this is a must have. Life affirming music.",1501977600,5

7566,140,3122,"Going Back was originally released in 2010, with 18 songs on it, and 25 songs on the deluxe version. There were 4 more bonus tracks available on the DVD, which were downloadable, for a total of 29 songs. Phil thought that was too many songs, so for this 2016 remaster, he retitled the album ""The Essential Going Back"" and trimmed it down to 14 songs. This is a blunder in my view, no matter how he justifies it. Especially with 2 CDs to fill up. The other 15 songs could have (and should have) been somewhere on this collection, even if they were weaker than the 14 songs he chose to keep (which will be a matter of opinion to each listener). It's sort of like ""Coda"" by Led Zeppelin. The last album, and weakest one, but one you still need to complete your collection. The songs here aren't terrible, the production is great and if I could describe the performances in one word, it would be ""perfunctory.""",1502150400,3

7569,2095,3124,"Lately Ive been having a great deal of success in finding large compilations of classical music at unbelievably low prices. Ive been reading some uniformly glowing reviews of the Big Box albums from The Bach Guild, so I decided to purchase one to see if its as good as reviewers say it is.

My first choice was the Big Haydn Symphonies Box, featuring over nine hours of Franz Joseph Haydns symphonies, for only 99 cents. This MP3 album contains a quite impressive array of music from the composer known as the father of the modern symphony. Haydn composed 104 symphonies during his long lifetime, and 24 of them appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Symphonies Box. They range from his earlier light-hearted works, through his more impassioned Sturm und Drang middle symphonies, and on to his most famous later Paris and London symphonic masterpieces.

These are all very fine performances from the 1950s through the 1970s. They feature various world-class orchestras and conductors who seem to mostly hail from eastern Europe. These ensembles may not have been as renowned as many of their more famous western counterparts, but their artistry and musicianship are undeniably every bit as good. They consistently do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama of Haydns great symphonic masterworks.

There are two unfortunate technical flaws in Big Haydn Symphonies Box that prevent me from awarding this otherwise outstanding album my full 5-star rating. There is a short but noticeable high-pitched tone at the 1:19 mark of track 13. Although its not particularly bothersome, the albums engineers should have noticed and removed it. Also, the final movement of Symphony No. 90 is incorrect. Although the tracks metadata correctly lists it as Finale: Allegro Assai, the music is actually a duplicate of the first movement of Symphony No. 91. Again, the albums engineers should have discovered and eliminated this error.

Despite these minor flaws, Big Haydn Symphonies Box is an excellent MP3 album that I enjoy listening to on a regular basis. Highly recommended.",1502150400,4
7570,2095,690,"Lately Ive had a great deal of success in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at the unbelievably low price of 99 cents. I recently acquired The Bach Guild's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com, and I liked it so much I decided to add another one of the Big Box albums to my digital music collection. This time I chose the Big Mozart Box. It turned out to be an inspired choice.

Big Mozart Box features nearly 14 hours of instrumental music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all for only 99 cents. This superlative MP3 album contains an extraordinarily impressive array of music from a variety of sub-genres within the oeuvre of Mozarts music. Mozart is known to have composed over 600 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his short lifetime. Over 40 of his instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Mozart Box. They include divertimenti, serenades, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, and others. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Mozarts incredibly inventive musical genius.

These are all superb performances from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in every performance. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Mozart infused into his music. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings (a few of them are monaural), the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.

Of all the Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I think Big Mozart Box is clearly the best. I listen to it constantly, and I am always highly entertained by it. Most highly recommended.",1502150400,5

7597,549,3023,"Hard to believe that today really is Whitney Houston's birthday, and she would've been 54 years old. Musically, she is one of the greatest divas in the world, that has shown that true beauty is solely from the voice within. She showcased a amazing bravado at the heart of the matter. But overall, she died at a very young age. But if there is one thing that I have known about Whitney, is that unlike other divas of today, her voice really reached from the deepest inner soul, something that I still adore today, much more than today's divas like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles that are products, not people. It also is the 25th anniversary of The Bodyguard soundtrack, the biggest selling soundtrack in the world, that absolutely defined a era of the music, the 1990's. I absolutely adore all of the songs Whitney Houston performed on the soundtrack, and Run To You is absolutely no exception. The song is absolutely beautiful & soulful from Whitney's vocals, each time I hear the song. It truly is astonishing & beautiful. It really is that high of the top tier, as is the case with I Will Always Love You & any other ballad Whitney had recorded over the years. It truly is a lovely opus that is worth any listener's ear that really strikes the essence of beauty. This is one Whitney Houston song I sincerely recommend listening to.

The return of the aggressive screaming showcasing Chester's unique voice is part of Linkin Park's appeal along with Mike's rapping, and the EDM flavor that the DJ produces.  It's a great album, one that makes up for A Thousand Suns.  One thing about Linkin Park is that they evolve from one album to another.  I recommend not comparing their latest albums with past albums and you will enjoy it.  Keep an open mind and listen to them a few times, there's many songs that will relate to you.",1502236800,5

7704,2095,672,"My great luck in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices continued earlier this week when I acquired The Bach Guild's Big Haydn Box from Amazon.com for only 99 cents. This is the fourth of The Bach Guilds Big Box albums that I have added to my digital music collection, and I think I made another inspired choice.

Big Haydn Box (not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>, which I have already reviewed), features over 14 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns wonderful music. It is an extraordinarily impressive array from a variety of sub-genres within Haydns oeuvre. Haydn is known to have composed over 500 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his lifetime. By my count, 40 of his vocal and instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Box. They include divertimenti, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, masses, and an oratorio. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Haydns incredibly inventive musical genius.

These recordings from the mid-20th century feature various lesser-known but world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, choirs, and solo instrumentalists and vocalists who hail mostly from eastern Europe. All of them demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in each of their performances. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Haydn infused into his music. I have now listened to well over half of this album and I think the audio quality of these mostly older stereophonic recordings is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.

Of the four Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I rank Big Haydn Box right alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;as one of the best in my digital music library.

And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time,
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line. - Jimmy Webb

Five MEMORABLE Stars. The immortal golden hit song, Wichita Lineman was written by the legendary composer Jimmy Webb and sung by Grammy-winning singer Glen Campbell. It is one of his biggest hits amid an awesome string of hits that crossed over genres to a wide audience of fans. It is a ballad about a hardworking, pole climbing technician keeping the lines up and working for the customers. The other musicians on the recording included Campbell, session orchestra arranger Al De Lory on piano; Al Casey, James Burton, and Carol Kaye on guitars; with Don Bailey on bass, Jim Gordon on drums and a string section.

In the performance, Campbell uses his acclaimed distinctive voice, vocal sincerity and role-projection ability, as well as his guitar musicianship. The excellent arrangement of the strings is by pianist De Lory. Built upon a loping beat and backed primarily by guitars and ethereal strings with reeds and a piccolo imitating morse code. In the song, the linemans focus shifts between technicalities and problems of his job, amid his intruding thoughts about a woman that he wants and needs. Actually, Webb wrote the song inspired by driving alongside miles and miles of lines and telephone poles and seeing one solitary lineman technician in the middle of nowhere working on top of a pole, all by himself. Webb was reportedly also inspired by a failed romance. This is yet another great Glen Campbell performance that paints an indelible musical scene. My Highest Recommendation. Five FABULOUS Stars.

It has that classic folk-rock sound that was at its height during the mid-60s. Thought provoking lyrics that are in many ways still relevant today 50+ years later. Despite how much time has passed since this tune came out originally it sounds and feels like it was written today about society we live in now. An all-around great song to download.",1502755200,5

7809,2213,3165,"Released in 2016, XI is Metal Church's eleventh album (naturally), marking the return of second frontman Mike Howe after 23 years absence. XI is their fourth album with Howe, which means both Howe and Munroe are tied with four studio albums each. Original singer David Wayne did three, but since he released his own METAL CHURCH album in 2001 and it was originally slated to BE a Metal Church album (until Vanderhoof changed his mind), he arguably did four as well.

To be expected, XI sounds like the four previous Ronny Munroe albums, except with Howe singing. Whether you prefer Munroe or Howe is a matter of personal taste. I like 'em both but don't love 'em; neither possesses Wayne's special appeal IMHO, e.g. his moving falsetto. However, if backed up against a wall concerning Munroe and Howe, I'd probably pick Munroe because he's closer to Wayne's style. That said, Howe's certainly stalwart & passionate and can really nail a song, like ""Fake Healer.""

So what about XI? It's a solid Metal Church album that will grow on you, like the five previous Metal Church releases. While it doesn't contain anything of the caliber of ""Watch the Children Pray,"" ""Fake Healer"" or ""Beyond the Black,"" it nevertheless has a few tracks that stand out, like the melancholic-but-compelling ""No Tomorrow"" and the driving ""Killing Your time,"" both of which were advance releases. The kinetic/proggy opener ""Reset"" was also released in advance as a video a week before the album's debut.

The punchy closing song ""Suffer Fools"" is one of the best while the mysterious & groovin' ""Needle & Suture"" is one of my favorites. Most of the songs are embellished with eerie, atmospheric parts with some whole tracks having that vibe, like ""Sky Falls In"" and ""It Waits."" There are also some interesting experimental ditties or parts, like ""Shadow."" Howe sounds like he never left.

7873,2095,2678,"In my quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Bigger Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the second of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including a comprehensive offering of his piano sonatas, his only violin concerto, his complete Diabelli variations and piano concertos, four of his nine symphonies, as well as dances, songs, rondos, bagatelles, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Bigger Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I am slightly less enamored of it. This is mainly due to two reasons:

1. There are no string quartets or piano trios on ""Bigger Beethoven Box."" Many of Beethovens greatest chamber music masterpieces belong to these two sub-genres, and I think the fact that  none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.

2. The albums engineering is not quite as good as it is on other Big Box albums  especially Big Mozart Box and Big Haydn Box. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.

Despite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience.

It was a tragedy when Pete died, but at least they released one finale album before he passed away. This album contains all of the trade mark sounds of Type O Negative and contains a lot of soon to be classic songs. There will never be another band like them and they will live on as a pinnacle of the goth metal sound. Great songs on the album include: ""September Sun"" and ""Halloween in Heaven"".",1502928000,5

You get the original CD with Nirvana gems - like their break-through it ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", the rocking ""Come As You Are"" ""Breed"" my personal favorite ""Territory Pissings"" and one I hadn't heard in sometime now ""Lounge Act"". In addition, there are nine bonus cuts to fill out disc one - with three B-sides - including several live at Paramuont Theatre and two live at Del Mar - including one that I don't remember at all - the very happening ""Been A Son"". Disc two is nearly as fantastic with eight (8) songs from the Smart Studio Sessions including their Velvet Underground cover ""Here She Comes Now"" + eight tracks from the Boombox Rehearsals and two songs from the BBC.

8031,2239,3196,One of the favorite tunes from my memory locker.,1503360000,5
8032,2128,2299,"Return to form for Pop! Well, he bounces around from form to from and probably doesn't care what anyone says, but his foray into French crooner wasn't exactly to my taste. . Anyways, great, rock album. Big fan of Matt Helders, the drummer from the amazing Arctic Monkeys, and although I'm not a fan of Josh Homme's Queens of the Stone Age Band, his instrument playing and production on this album is very admirable. The best way I can describe it is if you took the Berlin era sound (albums ""The Idiot""/""Lust for Life"") and the singing/lyrics of ""American Caesar"". Don't get me wrong- this is not a rehash using popular albums a framework for success. The album is very modern. In a few years after the novelty has worn off, I suspect I'll still consider a few of these songs ( ""Gardenia"", ""Sunday"") top-pop!",1503360000,5
8033,2261,3197,Sounds great. I love the older music.,1503360000,5
8034,2262,1183,Very uplifting praise song.,1503360000,5
8035,2096,3065,"While her voice isn't the most technical, Keira Knightly does just fine. I have heard much worse. I am really proud of her for singing professionally. I rather enjoyed the movie due to the music, so I bought this Album",1503360000,4

8049,1334,3201,I like the album but I don't necessarily love it.  It was suggested to me because I love Halestorm but not really in the same league as her.  Not bad. I went thru the whole album a few times to give it a fair review.  There are few songs that stand out and think there is potential to be pretty good.  I'd like to see where they go from here.,1503360000,4
