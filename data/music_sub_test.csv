But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live

 I was 16-17 when it was released. Stars was originally sung by Janis Ian. But Cher classified it as a true heartbreaker. This and Two the hard way with Greg Allman are my favorites. Just this one time .. is amazing rock n roll.. Cher's voice carries a gentle breath of heartbreak (as does Elton John).. and I'm glad to see.. she's a bigger draw today than the remaining big guns of the last few decades. Cher is Living Proof..(ok..pun).. age is just a number. You'll get there soon enough.. be kind. Cause karma will kick your ass if you're not. Love Cher.",1517011200,5

I remember hearing it and loving it in my childhood and teens, and even as an adult it captivated me.  Now, after Dolores' death, it's taken on a melancholy and haunting air, but it nonetheless remains one of my favorite songs.  It marries upbeat instrumentation with wistful lyrics and vocals, somehow weaving a music experience that's at once haunting and lively.

Always a classic, this song is now a bittersweet listening experience, and well worth purchasing and downloading.",1517184000,5

10876,1637,3500,"As with most DC5 hits collections this one is also compiled more based on UK popularity verses US. The sound quality is excellent. The final song, ""Universal Love"" is the only previously unreleased track. Its pretty good. Nice to hear that great Mike Smith vocal on a new song. Overall, its pretty similar to the ""Glad All Over Again"" CD. The only difference is the new unreleased song and one other extra song not included on ""Glad All Over Again"". I'd probably opt for whichever one I could find cheapest.

Better yet, from an American perspective, I still prefer the 2-CD collection ""History Of The Dave Clark Five"" if you can find it. There you get 50 songs with a nice selecton of album tracks. But, even that release still falls short in my eyes as it doesn't include many of their latter day U.S. single releases that either didn't chart or charted very briefly. Worse yet, like all other DC5 hits collections, it actually doesn't include two songs that charted fairly high in 1967, ""A Little Bit Now"" and ""You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby"". For the life of me I can't understand why these two songs always get excluded. I'd love to hear those very hard to find songs. We can only hope for a nice rarities release someday but based on Dave Clark's track record, I wouldn't hold my breath.",1517529600,4

10901,874,911,"For a long time the only song I regularly listened to by Toto was ""Rosanna.""  What can I say -- you tend to stick to the music you grew up with.  But after hearing from multiple sources that ""Africa"" was one of their best, I decided to give it a listen.  Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer ""Rosanna"" over ""Africa,"" ""Africa"" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.

""Africa"" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, ""some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?""

A pleasant song, and a good listen for anyone who enjoys Toto or '80s music in general.  Pairs nicely with ""Rosanna"" or anything by Starship or Journey.",1517788800,4

10941,1744,1953,"This CD has some filler tracks but overall its decent pop. The bonus tracks are all winners on the deluxe edition in my book!  Spiritual is my favorite bonus track. John Mayer co-wrote it with Katy. If it wasn't for Teenage Dream, Katys sophomore album, this would probably be her best album! My favorite single from this album is probably the fun song, This Is How We Do.

In Berkeley, he opened for Jesse Colin Young, whom most of the audience came to see and most of whom were unfamiliar with Waits' music and surprised by his style (to say the least). In any case, I love just about everything Tom Waits has recorded, but this period of his music has a special place for me. I think of this music as Beat jazz, the sort of music you might hear in a tiny jazz club where everyone wears black turtlenecks and a goatee.",1518825600,5

11081,2933,3656,"For most devotees of classical music there is a special fondness for the slow gentle movements in symphonies (the pinnacle may be the Adagietto from Mahlers Symphony No. 5 which happens to be the initial track on this recording!). This collection is a generous sampling of the great Adagio movements in the literature and though the performing groups and orchestras and conductors vary the overall result is a very satisfying entry into another uncluttered world.

One excellent example is a work by Italian Baroque composer Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671  17 January 1751) whose Adagio in G is present in varying forms  the original for strings is performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra & David Parry as is an adaptation Adagio in G Minor for Strings and Organ. This particular work is often used by film composers to special effects  as in the current The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Gallipoli, L'anne dernire  Marienbad, Rollerball, Manchester by the Sea, Flashdance, etc.

The selections are excellent and well placed in the sequence for listening. Relax, allow the present to go away for a bit of time and feel the restorative powers of Adagios. Grady Harp, February 18",1518912000,5

11090,1324,3659,"Over four albums, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have passed from their folk-rock beginnings to Potter wielding her open-E-tuned Gibson Flying V through stadium-stompers rockers like Paris (Ooh La La) and The Lion the Beast the Beat.  Midnight continues this trend with Hot to the Touch, Alive Tonight, and the rebel-yell Instigators.  However, rumors are that Potter fired The Nocturnals halfway through the album, relying much more heavily on collaborative writing with producer Eric Valentine  who also played nearly all the instruments on Midnight.  This insular approach resulted in quite a number of tracks that don't sound as fully developed as they might have been with input from a fully experienced band.  The drum-machined Delirious sounds like a Gloria Estefan knockoff.  The melody of The Miner bears more than a passing resemblance to Paul McCartneys My Love.  And Your Girl is Prince without the prance.  Lyrically, nothing on Midnight carries the soulful fire of Potters biggest ballad Stars, from her previous album The Lion the Beast the Beat.  If Nobodys Born with a Broken Heart is supposed to be poetically profound, Potters romance with Valentine has clearly weakened her critical judgment as a writer.  And while Potter remains in fine voice, the diminished influence of The Nocturnals leaves Midnight a mixed bag of tricks.",1518998400,3

Im not sad! It gorgeous and dark and sultry just like that vibe that Red Velvet brings! The packaging is gorgeous and is from the Automatic video.

11172,840,3668,"This set has been available for a while now in this edition and has already been reviewed, but I find this music to be so great that I thought I'd (hopefully) bring some more attention to this live set for fans of Hall and/or jazz guitar.  The set is from artistShare (sic)  which is fan-funded.

The original edition from a few years ago (of 250 copies I believe) had the three CDs of music and an extra High Resolution disc included.  The packaging was a 150 page hardcover book-style package which is no longer available, and the cost was (to me) high--$75.  But it sold out quickly leaving many fans in the cold.

The set now available for around $40 (still a bit expensive)  is just the three CDs of music in a nice three panel foldout cardboard package.  The discs each have a pocket--which have been intelligently cut to facilitate getting each disc out of it's pocket--a list of tracks for each disc, a list of personnel, a b&w photo of Hall and bassist Thompson (no Clarke sadly) at Bourbon Street, and recording information.  That's it.  While the music is the most important thing here, I do wish a booklet could've been included--maybe not 150 pages like the original--but at least a few pages about the gig and the music for Hall's many fans--and especially for fans of this gig.

I still own the original LP I purchased way back in the '70s on A&M, and it's still one of my favorite jazz guitar albums.  If you're reading this you're probably aware of that original album, and this set of volumes 2-4 is equally good.  If for some reason you're unfamiliar with this music--and like jazz guitar--do yourself a big favor and listen to the original album (Vol. 1) under the title ""Live!"" which is available for little money.  It's full of standards (as are volumes 2-4) but Hall and the band imbue them with a sparkling life that captures your attention from the outset.  Then if you can swing it, purchasing volumes 2-4 will be a no-brainer.  Jazz guitar doesn't get any better than hearing Hall, Clarke, and Thompson on this live date back in '75.",1519257600,5

11191,628,2360,"I am going to admit that the only reason I picked this up is because I came across I Surrender on YouTube and was moved to worship and tears.  I wanted that song in my collection and hoped that I would find more of the same.  Well, I both did and didnt.  I did because there is a bounty of worship none of which I was familiar with but I didn't because I didn't find any other song that generated the same type of emotional or worshipful connection that I Surrender did.  Im not terribly into worship music and don't like a lot of it so when I find something that I resonate so strongly with I end up having high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed but sometimes I found myself having to work at being engaged.  I do think that the albums last two tracks, Greater Than All with its crescendoing force and a studio version of Hope of the World with an upfront piano line and steady rhythm, are very good worship songs.  Vocalists vary and include both men and women leads.  There are some other tracks on here that are moving or that I just enjoy (the production is such that the live experience is muted and it really sounds more like a studio album with background shouts and choral voices and echoes tracked down) and I was surprised at how long Hillsong has been doing this and it being commercially available.  Personally I don't know that I will go out and purchase another Hillsong Live disc but at least they're on my radar.",1519430400,4

can listen to it.

There are tow songs on this album that I wanted in my Billy Joel playlist and ""It's still rock and roll to me"" is one of them. This is a song of changing fashion. It's quite cynical and has the wry humour that Billy Joel has made his specialty over the years. The music echoes the late '50s early '60s styles very well and carries the mood and lyric very well.

11541,887,2950,"Okay, I'm preaching to the choir here, but this is simply a wonderful package: 4 CDs of pure concert bliss!

Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers are on top of there game throughout these shows, recorded at various venues over many years. Whether it's original material or a tasty cover tune, Petty shows why fans loved him so much, performing every song with unbridled energy, passion, and emotional depth. Whether it's a rocker or a mid-tempo song Petty and the band know the way to your heart.

Another one of the (many) joys in listening to this set are the spontaneous audience participation bits. Mutual love. Mutual respect. Petty was simply one of the VERY best in the business. His studio albums were almost all great ones, but I think he especially thrived in a live setting. Listen to this and savor every song. And yeah, go ahead and sing along too!",1520812800,5

A few months after he was gone, I ran across a tribute to The Beatles and the song While My Guitar Gently Weeps where Prince, with Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and others was playing this live - I was a little taken aback when Prince stepped up and played the main guitar solo and holy crap, it was amazing to say the least - The Guy Shredded it and did so with such raw and pure emotion that it literally brought tears to my eyes - Needless to say after that I started doing searches for Prince doing other amzing guitar works and, I mean I am really ashamed to some extent that I never gave this guy a listen too many years ago - I mean here's Jimi Hendrix's passion, Michael Jackson's musical craetivity, Jimmy Page's Studio Prowess all tied into one - I respect this man, I adore this man, and I am deeply regretful I never saw him Live.

There are a couple spots in the song that are better than others and those others should not have been so blase', they could have made the song even better than they did at that time if they had  arranged it a bit differently, or added an extra part with a cool key change.

11776,1001,1657,Really this was his best solo album outside of STP. His work with Velvet Revolver was solid and Art of Anarchy a bit too heavy for his voice. You can tell he was enjoying this and the back up band is good if not a bit garage sounding. Weiland fans will be wild about it.,1521849600,4
11777,3063,3731,"I have aversion to ""New Age"" music, tends to remind me a little too much of elevator music, although recently I heard a Led Zeppelin song played with strings in an elevator so so much for that.  I first found Brian Crain on his piano & cello CD.  I love the cello and love that album.  This one with a violin instead isn't quite as near to my heart but it's still good.  My one big peeve is, why are there no liner notes???  I want to know who wrote what, who is that playing the violin?  All that kind of stuff.  I don't need a bio or some mystic hocus-pocus.  Just some information please.  I woudl recommend this to anyone who likes this ""relaxing"" music, get a nice glass of favorite wine, take off your shoes and put your feet up, close your eyes and let the music ease all those knots in your neck and back.",1521849600,4

11800,3072,903,"""Dreams"" was a song I loved way back when it first came out but I never knew what band did it.  After their lead singer passed away recently, I looked her up because she had a lot of fans who were crushed by her death; I thought she had to have *something"" to make her passing so dispiriting.  Delores O'Riorden had a voice you'd never forget, and this song was haunting in its melody but she put it over the top and made it unforgettable.  The only singer I can think of who came close to Ms. O'Riorden was Sinead O'Connor. The Cranberries songs are more pop whereas, Sinead's songs are less so.",1522022400,5

11817,3075,1245,"I am a newbie to Twenty one pilots first song I heard from them was ""Ride"" on the radio then I came across their cover of ""Cancer"" which I loved and then I loved the song ""Kitchen Sink"" which you can ONLY get off the cd because it is a bonus track, so I bought the cd for one song and it was the BEST decision I could have made because I wound up loving ALL the songs which does not usually happen with me. I have become a fan of ""screen"" and ""trees"". They have such deep content in their music that just speaks me on so many levels. I am not sure how other people interpret their music but I'm a christian going through some things right now with God (I'm not leaving, I'm just going through some things that's all) hints the song ""kitchen sink"" I hate what I believe and I love it at the same time. so I interpret a lot of their songs on a deep spiritual level. a lot of music that on the radio now is all about sex, drugs, alcohol, clubbing, and just empty to me, so its refreshing to me to come across music that's so raw with feeling and it just speaks to me. just buy it, you won't regret it.",1522108800,5

Even if you usually like living in a 4 season climate, there will be gray, depressing winter days. This song makes you feel that loss somehow, even if you've never been to California and don't even want to go.

My recommendations : Play this on a gray, nasty drive to work, at a job you don't really like. Next on the playlist should be ""Monday, Monday"".

If that doesn't move your soul, see a doctor.",1522281600,5

11930,549,1370,"It is so sad that Elton Joh  is set to retire from making new music, after 50 years as a mainstay, and one of the most universal and influential artists to have ever graced the stage. He has had so many highs  and achievements that no singer will ever replicate & lows that could've derailed his life & career. But through it all, his legacy will always be beyond the yellow brick road. He has had so many bountiful generations come to him, and why he is still standing strong, where others like Michael Jackson & Prince died so young. You can listen to any of Elton's songs, and they still sound better than what is on radio right now. But nevertheless, the one album many people will always go to is his 1973 double-album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which bridged so many divides in the music industry. The title track, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just very timeless to listen to, produced by the dear Gus Dudgeon, as a timeless portrait of what a musician's soul is like when he finally meets his future and runs with it for a new light at the end of the tunnel. If you are new to Elton John's music, after all these generations or a very dear hard core fan, you'll absolutely want to go to this track as one of the first to listen to.

My friend used to botch the lyrics, to sing it to me, like Plant was being gay or something... funny, I really think Mark was the one transferring some gay-ness there. Whatever... LOL... My mind wanders thinking this far back. Just heard it on a friend's playlist, and was transported right back to that schoolbus and this song on it, without Mark's commentary. LOL

Does it stand any test of time? No, not really. It really really screams 1979... I still wonder who Luke's dad is, listening to this thing (Star Wars reference, sorry).

12211,476,3771,Downloaded this song cause it is great. James Carr not a really big name star but a great singer. He was very popular in the Rythum and Blues area. Dark End of the Street was recently used in the Starz series Counterpart. It fit nicely in the movie setting as a man sat on a bench on a dark street when the song started playing I felt this series had class whoever remembered that song. You should Download this song and others by Mr. James carr. It was released as a 45 back in 1967  was not a big hit maybe hit about # 75 on the chart.,1523491200,5

12230,2445,2432,"My first experience with the performances of Sndor Vgh was over 30 years ago, when my Gramophone ""Good CD Guide"", 1992 edition, recommended the Vgh recording of Mozarts Cassations&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cassations-KV63-99/dp/B000001WLD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">(Cassations, KV63 & 99)</a>, describing them as ""Works of great charm and vitality"". Since that time, that particular recording has become one of my favorite Mozart CD's as I've built my collection with a great variety of performances of Mozart's works, and many others.

In the booklet that accompanies this box set, it's mentioned that 'of the 626 numbers in the Kchel catalogue, the directory of the works of Mozart, nearly one third are to be considered works of entertainment music, including those cultivated forms of evening entertainment whose musical expression is to be found in the terms serenade, divertimento, cassation and notturno. Mozart wrote thirty works in this instrumental genre alone, but he would have perhaps been hard pressed to provide a precise musical definition for these concepts . . .'

This collection includes many but not all of the aforementioned thirty works, along with a few selected marches, minuets, and dances. Altogether I consider this to be some of Mozart's most delightful music, lighter in style and feel than many of his more famous works, all scored for string ensemble with wind instruments appearing in perhaps a third or more of the selections here.

This collection brings together recordings made during the period 1986-1990, all recorded at various venues in Austria. The music is graceful and elegant and the performaces by Camerata Academica des Mozarteums Salzburg, led by Sndor Vgh, one of the most highly regarded chamber musicians of our age, are excellent. This box set includes an informative booklet with details of the venues and dates of each recording, and short essays on all of the works performed, written in German by Dr. Gerhard Walterskirchen and translated into English.

If you are looking for other CD's that contain this music, I can also recommend the following (I also have the second set below as part of my own collection):

  -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenades-for-Orchestra/dp/B00000410K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenades for Orchestra</a>&nbsp;is a box set of 7 CD's that was issued originally in 1990 as one of the 45 volumes in the Philips ""Complete Mozart Edition"". Performances are by  Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields Orchestra, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner.
  -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenades-Dances-Marches/dp/B0000501PE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenades Dances Marches</a>&nbsp;is a box set of 13 CD's, also from Philips ""Complete Mozart Edition"" which has been repackaged into fewer but larger box sets. This set includes the 7 CD's from the Serenades box above, plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-Marches/dp/B00000410N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances & Marches</a>.

12317,3151,1987,"ULTIMATE 5TH DIMENSION: Call them the black MAMAS & THE PAPAS if you want...unbelievably, THE 5TH DIMENSION sounded even more vanilla than that undisputed pinnacle of MOTOWN crossover acts, DIANA ROSS & THS SUPREMES. Front woman MARILYN MCCOO's beauty contest looks and cool vocal flair, coupled with the group's knack for covering some of the best song craftsmen of their era (LAURA NYRO, JIMMY WEBB, etc.) resulted in an unbroken string of Top 40 gems from the late sixties through the early seventies. MCCOO's husband BILLY DAVIS JR. succeeded in piercing the gang's RNB bubblegum with a delicious blast of unhinged gospel grit on the second half of HAIR medley AQUARIUS/LET THE SUN SHINE IN...but for the most part, the 5D were as safe and reliable as THREE DOG NIGHT or THE GRASS ROOTS. The euphoric highlights rounded up on VERY BEST (UP, UP & AWAY, ONE LESS BELL TO ANSWER, STONED SOUL PICNIC) are plentiful here, from five talented performers more than capable of taking pristine pop vocal harmony to another dimension.

Considering the list of great songs he has written over the decades that certainly says a lot. With his partner Art Garfunkel they created a mood and tone to the song that was a commentary about society in the mid-1960s as America was in the middle of a political and cultural turmoil. Their harmonization, which was always something they were well known for, is exceptional in this recording.

12380,2966,2813,"Great great album from Scott Henderson and crew. Henderson is one of the absolute best guitarists out there, and this recording gives ample proof of this fact. Got something for everyone here. Travis Carlton (bass) and Alan Hertz (drums) provide excellent backup to Scott's clear and precise playing. I thought I detected a hint of boogie on the first track ""Church Of Xotic Dance"". Most of this album is straight forward and dynamic with a couple of slower more mellow jazz tunes. Overall an A+++ grade .",1524096000,5

12538,2842,3513,"Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers were already seasoned veterans by the time the show at My Father's Place in Roslyn, NY was recorded for radio broadcast in November 1977. The first album by the band had been in shops since 1976 and the band was about to start recording it's second album. For most of 1976 and 1977 Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers were on the road and right in the middle of the Punk craze from England, Tom Petty and his band played a combination of 1960's rock music and 1970's punk and found that audiences from the get-go could not get enough of it.

This show from Long Island in the club finds our heroes right in their element in front a small but happy crowd of foks. There are already hits and fan-favorites featured in the set. ""American Girl"" ""I Need To Know"" ""Listen To Her Heart"" & ""Breakdown."" and those songs are paired up here the cover songs ""Shout"" ""Route 66"" and ""Jaguar & Thunderbird."" The band is already a powerhouse with Ron Blair's bass guitar right up in the mix.
Benmont Tench, tickles his ivory keys and aids much weight to this band. Stan pounds those drums with fury and Mike Campbell is a beast from opening chords right through till the end of the show. Tom, is the leader of this party and he gives the people what they want.

If you have wondered what Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers sounded like in the early days this collection of great live music gives you the goods.
The road would get larger as Tom Petty would play a few more big gigs after this night in Long Island in 1977.

12634,1317,3498,"Multiple people in my life who have known me for a while know that I am a fan of multiple songs by Madonna and Angel by Madonna happens to be one of the one of a kind songs by her that I enjoy. Angel seems to be a spiritually healing music tune about meeting someone who has a blissful/joyful influence on ones life. The lyrics of you came when I wished for you within the song indicates meeting someone in your life who seems to be almost sent from heaven in ones life. The lyrics just now I realize within part of the song seems to me to be a positive dedication mini story about noticing after getting to know the person how they are an angel. Fortunately for me, I consider my husband of 14 years an angel in my life and I am frequently reminded from his positive example on  how to have both a forgiving heart and a modest spirit. He is very modest on multiple things that I feel he deserves to give himself more value on yet that is something obviously for another post.",1525305600,5

I understand that the meaning of this song is definitely going to vary by whoever hears it yet I take Blaze of Glory to be a powerful tune of someone admitting that they would like to end their life on a high note if possible (the part of the song where the lyrics are written to address God may obviously suggest an understanding andor awareness that when andor how a person dies is obviously not always under their control).,1525478400,5

I'm going to nitpick anyway: to improve this comp from five stars to sublime perfection, I'd have swapped out ""Hi Hi Hi"" and ""Mull of Kintyre"" to make room for ""Listen to What the Man Said"" and ""Helen Wheels"" and maybe even ""Sally G"" if there was room for it. All three had significantly more airplay on American radio than those two songs.

13049,628,2372,"Shinedowns vocalist Brent Smith and guitarist Zach Myers strip down and unplug to cover several classics and their choices are surprising and broad ranging from contemporary pop (Adeles Someone Like You), old school 80s rock (Phil Collins slow-build In the Air Tonight and Bon Jovis classic Wanted Dead Or Alive), and Seattle grunge (Pearl Jams Black).  For some reason they decided to split up their Acoustic Sessions into two parts and the first entry  is even more diversified but if I had to pick a favorite between the two I would go with this second, shorter session due to the strength of the Adele coververy moving and strong and I don't even listen to Adele; does anyone else want to see these two maybe perform a duet?and PJs impassioned tune.  I was surprised that my least favorite track was the one I anticipated being my favorite as I have always really enjoyed the slow-burn power of In the Air Tonight but with the percussion and in spite of their best efforts to provide that rising punch its just not there.  There are ten songs over the two releases and this second release accounts for four of the tracks.  All are live recordings but the production and levels are so good, so crisp, with audience volume and fuzz kept to a bare minimum that it might as well be a studio recording.  I like that, and another thing too, with Smith introducing each songs name and artist before they put the song out in a solid and clear presentation.  Smiths vocals are powerful but he doesnt try to overreach, or to make the song his own, or add too much to it.  The translations are pretty simple and straightforward.",1527379200,4

I was blown away by the shear intensity of this album and the fact that they modernized the sound of a lot of bands from the late 90s and early 00s. This is definitely an alternative metal album, but it is really heavy at times. Its also has some very good lyrics and even some spoken poetry to really add to the diversity.

13084,867,1810,"In 1979, a double LP, simply crimson with gold leaf lettering SinatraJobim Sessions found its way into more than a few rock and jazz boomer collections.  Antonio Carlos Jobim had gone from Brazilian Bossa Nova legend to a big name regular in the Creed Taylor CTI Jazz stable.  I was one of those who picked it up even though Frank Sinatra was my Fathers music, he was still cool and probably more so in the 70s because he went from covering My Music (Heres to you Mrs. Robinson, ooby dooby doo) to doing some stand up appreciable real jazz and resembling the towering mighty man who fronted Harry James and Tony Dorseys orchestras and rose to superstardom in the 50s and made cool-jazz music with His Highness Basie.  The only way to lay your hands on this prize was as an import in places like Tower Records or if you knew of its existence you could have your mom and pop record store order it for you at a price.  Only Jobim fans and extremely serious Sinatra fans knew about it from articles.  The other way to get this material was to back order the old Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra & Company (1971) but you were still left without three of the tracks they did together: ""Bonita"", ""Sabi"", and ""Off Key (Desafinado)"".  The 10 track Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim, arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, accompanied by a studio orchestra, is very nice but the real prize was the eagerly sought other half of the Sessions arranged by Deodato (stable-mate of Jobim in CTI, and 2nd greatest Brazilian jazz man after Jobim alongside the Joo Gilberto family) and conducted by Morris Stoloff.  Of particular note: Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Darn those Beatles!  Sinatra and Jobim worked together for a final time in 1994 on Duets II, recording a cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" if you want to be complete you will have to get that one too!

The original collection of Sinatra & Jobim tracks on their collaborations included two recordings which do not actually feature Jobim, ""Drinking Again"" and ""Manh De Carnaval.  SINATRA/JOBIM: THE COMPLETE REPRISE RECORDINGS does not include them, instead you get all 20 original recordings featuring both artists in their work of genius together.  As Amazon does not see fit to give you the track listings on the CD, here is the full lineup with credits:

1. The Girl from Ipanema (Antnio Carlos Jobim, Norman Gimbel, Vincius de Moraes)  3:20

13099,1317,2277,This captivating country song that is Black by Dierks Bentley appears to be a love song about giving the green light to someone to act on how they emotionally feel (romantically speaking).

13181,1185,3846,"The fact that Cyndi Lauper can make Country Music palatable to someone like me who doesnt normally listen to it is a testament to her likeability as a vocalist. There are some great tunes here and this collection plays better than the snooze fest that was found on the AT LAST CD.

FUNNEL OF LOVE has Cyndis trademark vocal tics and hiccups and they work wonderfully in this context.

DETOUR sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s by Kitty Wells.

MISTY BLUE is a dynamic vocal performance, period. This and HARD CANDY CHRISTMAS are probably the best ones on the CD.

WALKNG AFTER MIDNIGHT is one of the weak links only because no one can sing this like Patsy Cline and the arrangement isn't as atmospheric as the original; the lack of male backup is detrimental. I FALL TO PIECES works much better even though its a carbon-copy version of Patsys.

HEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER has a vocal that is typical Cyndi and an average arrangement.

END OF THE WORLD is less cringe-worthy than the syrupy Skeeter Davis version.

YOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY with Vince Gill is a cute duet with lots of funny banter and it works better than the drowsy Willie Nelson duet on the country-blues number NIGHT LIFE.

I WANNA BE A COWBOYS SWEETHEART is noteworthy for the yodeling if nothing else.",1528761600,4
13182,3291,3114,Radiohead fills an interesting niche for me:  I needed relatively soft 'out there progressive' rock music that doesn't distract me from work but is stimulating enough to yoga/walk with.  I blindly bought 10 of their albums but really got into them for enjoyment after sampling this one.  I'm a dedicated Pink Floyd fan but I must admit I sometimes prefer this hypnotically spiritual spacey sound.  This album is pure mastery.,1528761600,5

What we have here is a remastering of the original stereo LP along with the full score (only six or seven minutes longer) in mono.  And you know what - except for obsessive, crazy must have every note of everything FANatics, the original album is perfect.  The six or seven additional minutes are not that different from the included cues, being variations on them.  And I'm sorry, I don't need to hear this in mono, ever.  As to the remastering of the LP presentation: The Varese album was HORRIBLE, so yes, this is better, but not that much better and it really should be that much better.  I shan't go into the reasons for it not being better.  Of course the score is wonderful, but the original LP presentation was perfect.",1529020800,4

I was strongly inspired by Mandy Harvey's journey, and her song, ""Try,"" was a powerful anthem about overcoming adversity and giving it your all even in the face of strong opposition and trials.

13257,954,3860,"Big Thief is a Brooklyn-based indie rock band fronted by singer/songwriter Adrienne Lenker. The band created some internet-buzz with a couple of early tracks, and that resulted in being signed to the Saddle Creek label, and the eventual release of this, their 2016 debut album.

""Masterpiece"" (12 track; 38 min.) opens with the dreamy ""Little Arrow"", a quick (2 min.) introduction to the warm vocals of Lenker. The title track (and radio single) follows, with Lenker crooning ""You saw the masterpiece, she looks a  lot like you/Wrapping her left arm around your right/Ready to walk you through the night"", just beautiful. Later on we get ""Real Love"" (radio single), where Lenker reminds us that ""Real love makes your lungs black/Real love is a heart attack"", wow. But wait, there's more! Another highlight is ""Paul"" (radio single), where Lenker brings another heartbreak story: ""Paul, I know you said you'd take me anyway I came or went/But I'll push you from my brain/See, you're a gently baby/I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain."" Most songs clock in around 3 min., and at 37 min., this album flies by in not time, and you will find yourself hitting the ""play"" buttom again and again. Just barely a year later after this album, Big Thief already released their second album, the equally excellent ""Capacity"", but in my book ""Masterpiece"" is the better album.

Big Thief has at time been touring as the opener for Conor Oberst, to whose Saddle Creek label the band is signed. Imagine my good fortune catching both of them last year at the beautiful Nelsonville Music Festival here in Ohio. Big Thief played an early evening set on the main stage before an appreciative crowd. If you have a chance to see Adrienne Lenker & Co. live, do not miss them! I received the ""Masterpiece"" CD as a Father's Day present from my 28 yr. old daughter who knows my musical taste quite well. Thanks Veronique! ""Masterpiece"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1529366400,4

13297,1878,3107,"I did not react too good to Bob Dylan as Sinatra-like crooner, although I gave it a shot as I like to think of myself as musically open minded. I've kind of worked backwards with his most recent trilogy, starting with Triplicate, and then moving on to Fallen Angels. Finally, I recently made it to the first album in the trilogy, Shadows in the Night. What at first seemed odd, out of place and wrong, now seems so perfectly right. I just didn't like Dylan in this guise because his voice it seems was always suited to raspy, bluesy, earthy rock numbers. His unique voice is perfect for that. But not for the Great American Songbook material he's been doing recently. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that you needed a pure, beautiful, golden, old fashioned crooner voice to do this stuff justice. You know, Sinatra, Dino, Ella, Bing, Judy, and the Divine Sarah. Dylan's voice would seem out of place here, and he does sort of miss the notes in a way that sounds like someone who can barely sing. But I kind of knew that if I gave these recordings more time and listening space, I might be able to get them. And I was right, big time.
  Dylan uses his ragged and torn voice to not just caress these tunes, but inhabit them. Get into their very fiber and core. Find out what makes them tick, and then recreate them all over. And you can have the most ripped up voice in the world and still make these songs magnificent. It takes two things: genius and care. Bob certainly has the genius, and after good, hard listening you see he really cares about this music deeply. It's not a sort of ""Oh this worked great for Rod Stewart so I'll try it too"" thing. Rod has the fantastic voice but just doesn't seem to care much in the music. Dylan knocks it out of the park. I am constantly amazed when an album by Bob that I didn't seem to get and thought was subpar or terrible, turns out to be, after time and care, really good if not really great. Chalk Shadows in the Night up on that very long list.
  You don't see musicians like this come along every day, and Dylan's like won't be seen again for maybe a hundred years or more. If ever. So this is precious stuff. Pick it up and swim in it's melancholy. It's worth it.----------PEACE",1529884800,4

When I tried to buy the soundtrack I was astonished none was available, so I settled for the suite version referenced elsewhere.  When, years later, I learned a soundtrack had been issued I was further shocked by a sales price approaching $100, well beyond my budget.  The price has been reduced to a more manageable amount, but I remain hesitant.  Why?  According to the listing the record only has about 35 minutes & omits a considerable amount of the score & there is a question as to whether its available on cd.  Thats not a whole lot longer than the suite I own.  So for now the purchase decision remains undecided.

This was a Grammy Award-winning album (it won over The Beatles, for heaven's sake), so I wish Sony/BMG treated it with a bit more respect.

I'm 67 now and I love it. Music like this is timeless for those that love music.

It seems just like yesterday that Radiohead released its latest (9th overall) album, but in fact it's been already over two years ago since the band unleashed ""A Moon Shaped Pool""onto the world. I have to admit, at first I wasn't really ""getting it"", but over time, this album has in turn released its inner beauty and I have been playing this album a LOT in the last couple of months, ahead of the band's return to Cincinnati (more on that later).

""A Moon Shaped Pool"" (11 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the urgent ""Burn The Witch"", which reminds me of the ""Hail to the Thief"" songs. It is followed by ""Daydreaming"", an introspective tune (and traditional concert opener on the current tour). We then get to ""Decks Dark"", which is my favorite track: I love the gradual build-up, and then the extra kick in the last 90 sec., just perfect, The album is now revved up and in full gear. Not that it means the songs are all loud or hard, far from it, but there is a cohesion to the soundscape as we go from track to track that just feels right. Among other highlights: ""Ful stop"" is mesmerizing, and ""The Numbers"" feels wistful. The album's closer is ""True Love Waits"", the song that has been around for 2 decades in one form or another. The live acoustic guitar version on 2001's ""I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings"" is a thing of beauty, but now comes this definitive version, featuring piano and keyboards, rather than acoustic guitar. What a great song.

I've seen Radiohead live a number of times over the years, and had the good fortune of seeing them in concert again this week here in Cincinnati. They played a 2 hr. 20 min. show that can only be described as magical. Playing from pretty much their entire catalog, the sold-out crowd ate it up from start to finish.

13390,736,2456,Caught Plant and the Sensational Space Shifters on Austin City Limits and head to have their CD... and it did not disappoint. I'm amazed at how strong Robert's voice still is and am hard pressed to remember a better pair of guitarists in a single group.,1532563200,5

Call Me Baby Transformer Exodus El Dorado Hurt these are all amazing songs and the rest of the album is not bad at all, its one of those albums you don't have to skip through you just let it play! I was toooo happy to get the Xiumin Version and getting a D.O photo card made me even happier. You cant go wrong with this CD, EXO is extremely talented and just a pleasure to listen too. The photo book is gorgeous, Xiumin looks amazing! Buy this album so you can appreciate EXO!",1532649600,5
13394,1226,2894,"Good album, every song is strong except ""Kiss It"" is a little too commercial.",1532736000,4
13395,1317,3879,"I admit that I keep an open mind to listening to multiple online, offline and local radio sources for accessing my past, current, and future music interests. Recently, I encountered a situation through my iheartradio app where 2 of the local radio rock stations I enjoy listening to have yet to play and work even though I recently and easily got an outside the metropolitan Washington D.C. area radio station to work. It is a good thing that I at least still have a radio inside my apartment yet I still wanted to way to listen to some classic rock music when outside of my apartment despite the situation. Fortunately, I came across this Amazon music playlist that is Top Prime Songs: Classic Rock that contains a range of classic rock tunes such as; Hotel California by the Eagles, Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles, Dont Fear the Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult, Listen To the Music by the Doobie Brothers,Beast of Burden by the Rollingstones, Lifes Been Good by Joe Walsh, music by Peter Gabriel, Aerosmith, Foghat, Kansas, Heart, ZZTop, and more. The only caveat is that this Top Prime Songs Classic Rock playlist is currently at the time of this writing just a sampler of 25 songs and leaves out a number of other artists groups such as; Bon Jovi, Journey, Billy Idol, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Clash, The Cure, the Styx, The Cars, David Bowie, Tom Petty, Survivor,Van Halen etc. (you get the picture).",1532822400,5

13429,292,3789,"The first major hit song for David Bowie of a long list of many that would follow. The first time I heard of Bowie was when he released this song. The lyrics as well as the overall production of the song as well as the whole ""Space Oddity"" album itself captured my attention and made me a fan. What really makes this all the more enjoyable now to listen to is the remastered 2015 version that has been released. It brings a whole new dimension to the sound and mood of ""Space Oddity"". You got to download and listen for yourself to see what I mean. I highly recommend adding this to your playlist.",1534032000,5

13432,1917,3038,"This is a simple song, best listened to while sitting in the shade, in an Octopus's garden, if at all possible. A little bit of pleasant escapism, imagining an actual time spent pleasantly with friends, away from it all.",1534204800,5
13433,1917,204,"Hard to tell with this one. Easy to understand in the context of the ""Yellow Submarine"" movie, but outside of that? Perhaps a philosophical musing on the working man, so caught up in the daily grind and responsibilities, that he is either afraid of or just putting off his artistic, passionate endeavors until later? When will he realize that he shouldn't wait because ""the world is at [his] command""?",1534204800,5
13434,1917,2956,"This song has always been one of the most singularly heart-breaking and hopeful in all that I have listened to. The tone is sombre, but the lyrics are like a good friend counseling you through the darkest times and showing you the distant, but bright light.",1534204800,5

13442,907,674,"At this point, Justin Bieber can do no wrong. It is strange for me that this very young man is the top male vocalist of the decade. Still, he is a good singer, and he has an even better sense of which songs he adds his vocals to.

Skrillex is a master DJ and composer of dance songs. The beat here is fantastic, and the lyrics have a theme. They are thought out. This is a good song.",1534550400,4

13447,3272,2027,The songs can get pretty hard and lyrically gritty. Faith No More always orig.music to bring to the table. Worth listening. Obviously not their best but its def.not worth overlooking,1534809600,4

Hello, from the other side, I must have called a thousand times

(Courtesy of Amazon Prime)
Five POWERFUL Stars. From the multi-award winning album 25, this is a marvelous, deliberately-building performance by multi-Grammy award winning singer, songwriter Adele performing Hello backed only by a piano and strings: no other instruments needed. Its about a distant love, an old love affair that still haunts her, and a need for closure. She takes the lyric for a memorable, emotional, thrill ride. The song won Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Record of the Year. My Highest Recommendation. Five SOARING Stars. (XL Recordings/Columbia. 1-MP3 track. Time-4:55.)",1535241600,5
