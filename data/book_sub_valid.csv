But will they make it through Culloden and the rising of '45? Only time will tell. If you don't love Scotland before you read this, prepare to fall in love with a country.
Diana Gabaldon is a gifted writer who not only crafts a heart-wrenching story, but also manages to engage all your senses in the reading experience. I am not a fan of science fiction, time travel, or first-person accounts and yet... I literally couldn't put this book down - and the entire Outlander series is now in my top fiction list.

5150,464,1650,"Oh this was fun  and easy to wholly see Lexis impulsive choices leading to difficulties kind of like the first snowball that rolled down the mountain, unaware that it would grow in size and take out several trees and a small village in the valley!  Lexi is the oldest daughter of the coach of the Chinooks, John The Wall Kowalsky, and has been slowly growing an online pet clothing business named after her latest pooch, a Chinese Crested named Yum Yum (or several variations and endearments of the same).  She has signed a lease on a brick and mortar store, and in looking for more publicity and a jump-start to make a splash for her store, she decides to join a reality show Gettin Hitched a bachelor-style story with a decidedly low-brow country theme.  Unfortunately, while her online store saw a large uptick in business, her competitive nature took over and she is the lucky winner of  a wedding to the bachelor chosen as the catch.  Knowing she doesnt love him, and finding that circumstances have snowballed beyond her control  she makes a plan with two childhood friends to escape  in a sea-plane decorated as a tree frog.

Sean Knox has just been traded to the Chinooks, and another of his mothers health emergencies has cropped up, forcing him to leave the team for a few days to head to the tiny British Colombia island where his mother lives.  Hes hired Jimmy to fly him to Sandspit  a cooler of Grey Goose and tonic water and a small overnight bag his only companions.  Until a woman runs down the dock in sparkly heels, veil, tiara and a wedding dress with poof and puff galore.  And the story begins: Lexi becomes headline news on the morning shows with many offering trips and rewards for spotting her, with Seans interest (and moment of omission in not telling her who he is) increasing despite his better judgment.  Of course, nothing in this story can go well, and after her return and struggle to appear sympathetic and not heartless in the press are shot to bits when a photo of she and Sean outside her motel door on Sandspit hit the tabloids.

A fake romance plot takes over here  and while the chemistry between them is obvious to everyone BUT them, the story isn't breaking new ground in any way. But, the moments with these characters, Lexis sharing of her fathers comments about Sean, unwittingly as he hasn't told her his full name, are adorable  and the teams obvious affection for Lexi and oddly sweet protective statements made about her are sure to bring a laugh.  While you see Lexi as a bit flighty  her purpose and intention, if full of stumbles is clear, and even as she frustrates Sean to no end  he cant help but think of her. Always.  Gibsons way of making characters accessible and empathetic no matter how arrogant (Sean) or ditzy (Lexi) appear to be makes it evident, in neon lights evident, that these two are meant to be together.  Lovely snips of moments with friends and family for Lexi, and her ability to understand and even redirect Seans mothers attention-seeking behavior is lovely, and the story leaves everyone with a smile in the end. Perfect for those escape the moment reads to distract and entertain.

5151,182,733,Adam takes our hand through his journey and together we find our release. I loved how the story of the Queen and the faun seemed so apart from the rest of the story until it all came together and made sense at the end. I hope Adam and Linus are okay.,1514505600,5
5152,681,1650,"The Art of Running in Heels was a pretty good read. Okay, this is Lexie Kowalsky all grown up, so those who have read Simply Irresistible get to see this. Now for those who are jumping into the story with out reading about her mother, like me, you I think it's a safe bet you will be okay. All I know is Lexie and her mother have similar tendency, they are both runaway brides.

Now trying to figure out where to beginning with this story. I thought it was a cute read. We have Lexie who has decided that getting married on reality TV is probably not the best thing, but she doesn't man up, oh no she runs. So right there makes the story interesting. She basically crashes Sean Knox's flight, and has no clue who he is. While he recognizes her as the coach's daughter. They basically hit it off. Things get a little complicated and they need to have a fake relationship. By the way, love fake relationships. We all know it's down hill for both of them. Now all they need to figure out is how to make this fake relationship as a real one.

Yes, I thought this story was super cute read. I thought Sean and Lexie were adorable together. I love how she kind of drives him crazy, but deep down he loves it. As I got closer to the end, I was thinking this story could use an epilogue. I thing seeing these two a little down the road would probably helped the story, but then again that's my opinion. However, The Art of Running in Heels was still a cute read. If you are a fan of fake marriage and reality tv, you might consider reading The Art of Running in Heels.

5153,199,1650,"Although I've liked all of er books, her ice hockey series is by far the best of all the books Gibson has written. So imagine how happy I was to find that not only does our hero play for the Chinooks, but the heroine's father was the hero in my favorite hockey story! I still remember that earlier book as though I'd just read it yesterday. One of the things I remember so well is Alexi, the heroine of this story, saying to John Kowalsky, the Chinook's player in the earlier book, ""Give me some sugar, Daddy!"", when she wanted a kiss from him. Was thrilled to catch up with John and Georgie and find out how their lives have turned out. Back to this book. Lots of quirky situations and characters; and even two rescue dogs--one with only 3 legs. What's not to like when a story includes dogs that have been rescued by good people who love them and give them a good home? And by people who do the wrong things for the wrong reasons but are still people you come to love. Happy endings all around.",1514505600,5
5154,355,1371,"Anthony Peardew is the keeper of lost things. When he finds something on his walk - a button, a glove, an earring - he takes it home to his study and writes a note on where he found the item in hopes that he can somehow, someday connect the item with its owner. He is also a famous author who has written stories based on the items that he's found. He is getting old and feeble and decides to turn his house and his quest for the owners of lost things to Laura when he dies. Laura, Sunshine (the girl across the street who has down's syndrome) and Freddy, the gardener, work together to give the lost things back to their owner and to lay the ghost in the house to rest.

The novel tells two main stories - that of Anthony, Laura, Sunshine and Freddy and an earlier story about Bomber and Eunice. The reader gets clues along the way but doesn't know if the two groups of people are connected and how they are connected.

This is an interesting debut novel by an author that I expect to see great books from in the future.",1514505600,4
5155,73,1281,"A short story, 2.5, in the Heartbreaker Bay contemporary romance series and revolving around the friends who live and/or work around the Pacific Pier Building in Cow Hollow in San Francisco. The couple focus is on Rory Andrews and Max Stranton. Oh, and Carl.

My Take
A too-short story, more of a blip in the life and using third person point-of-view. The story was a bit irritating as both characters had this I-wanna-don-wanna attitude going on. The fact that Rory and Max were incredibly decent characters made up for it. What made it great was their individual reactions to Carl, *grinning*.

Its an interesting conflict. Or should I say sets of conflicts? Max wants Rory, but he doesnt want her. And it all has to do with high school. Rory wants Max, but is shut off from him. And p-r-i-c-k-l-yhoo, boy. And it has nothing to do with high school

One thing to take away from the story is to always remember there are two sides to a story. Too often people hear one side and make up their minds from that.

The Story
Hours stuck in a truck on Christmas Eve with the dead sexy Max sounds like a fate worse than death (not), but Rorys out of options. Shes had a crush on Max since high school, and she knows hes attracted to her, too. But they have historyand Max is the only one who knows why it went south.

Theyve done a good job of ignoring their chemistry so far, but a long road trip in a massive blizzard might be just what they need to face their pastand one steamy, snowy night is all it takes to bring Max and Rory together at last.

The Characters
Rory Andrews fled her home in Lake Tahoe when she was seventeen and has been working for Willa for years. Her mother remarried and she has three half-sisters and a disappointed step-dad.

Max Stranton is a lethal weapon who works for Archer. Turns out, he also used to go to school with Rory back in the day. Carl is his big, lovable Doberman, who has been visiting Willas shop quite often. Cass is Maxs older, know-it-all sister.

Kendall is a friend of Cass. Tabby is a friend-with-benefits. Cindy had been a very popular girl at their high school and the daughter of the basketball coach. She was also toxic as hell.

The Pacific Pier Building
Willa owns South Bark Mutt Shop, selling pet supplies as well as providing spa and babysitting services for pets. Old Man Eddie is a homeless man who is a fixture, and everyone does their best to take care of him.

The Cover and Title
The cover is steamy with Rory, wearing a Nordic-style cream sweater with diamond banding across the shoulders in gray, with her back to the steering wheel as she sits on Maxs lap. Hes wearing a deep khaki green sweater with a thin cream stripe with what appears to be a cable knit sweater in gray. Rory has a cat-whos-liked-the-cream expression on her face while Max seems to be storing up the memory. Maxs snow-covered truck is a deep red with the title in a yellow script, each word angled across the door. The series information, in white, is below the title. In the upper third of the cover, the night is lit with old-fashioned streetlamps, casting a light royal blue glow in the background, although the sides are cast in shadow and bare tree branches. An info blurb is at the top in yellow while the authors name is large and in white, centered above the truck roof.

The title is definitely a hazard that forces that confrontation, on this One Snowy Night.",1514505600,4
5156,776,1286,"It begins with a pact made between soldiers facing the battle of the Somme, then switches, several years later, to an attempted murder on the road to Nice. Then a fatal road accident that makes no sense.... Todd has woven a very complex story with mounting casualties and Rutledge as usual crisscrossing the English countryside trying to figure out who the evil person behind the murders and attempted murders is.
I enjoyed this book far more than I have Todds last few Rutledges. First, I found there was more action to it, the dialogue between characters was tighter and more pointed to the actual case. Less fluff. But at the same time Todds excellent descriptions of the Sussex coast, of people drew me in as well. Perhaps it is because I have just returned from several months living on the Irish coast, in a small village. And so I could almost see what Todd is describing about the village, about the people.
Although the mystery is complex /nd I lost track of the reasoning a few times, ultimately I felt very satisfied with its conclusion. And I am hoping that Rutledge may have finally found a romance too.",1514505600,5
5157,460,1480,"Oh, Ms. Chase, how I have missed you! It's been two years since the end of her last series - The Dressmakers - and that is just much too long! I'm so excited for this book and a new series.

I simply love this couple, as individuals and together. Ripley is my favorite type of hero - a fun, good-natured scoundrel who's so much smarter than he lets on - and Olympia is a wicked smart bluestocking who just needs someone to help her see she's not the boring, responsible person everyone says she is.

These two should not have ended up together - she's betrothed to his best friend - so it was fun to see how their HEA would come about. They could have easily come off looking like complete jerks and the reader hating them, but I think LC succeeds in handling this issue well and allows them to remain likable characters.

This was a quick and fun read, filled with quite the comedy of errors, and strong character development - both main and secondary.

5161,87,598,"Ive never watched or heard any of Katy Turs reporting on NBC during the campaign. I was unaware of her involvement in the Trump campaign from the beginning. Im just a political junky and wanted to hear her stories of following the campaign.
She delivered on those and provided some interesting insight of the grueling life of a reporter following a campaign. This campaign was especially brutal but one gets the idea from her stories of the road.
Her style is interesting with little one liners dispersed through the story. At time I felt like the book was a stream of consciousness.
If you are looking to read about the election from a reporters perspective, this is worth your time and a quick read.

A side note that has nothing to do with the writing is the bizarre picture on the front and how that picture of her on the front cover looks nothing like her bio picture on the inside jacket cover. I'm confused as to what the implied meaning of the front cover is??

The author overwhelmed me with way too many hokey, cliche similes and contrived dialogue that kept taking me right out of the story: Eyes twinkling like stardust... / He was...a raven in a flock of white-winged doves. / He carried her to the pinnacle and together they flew, free as eagles. / And when their release came, they soared together...twin phoenixes rising from the ashes of their old selves. During sex, the hero had an entire honky-tonk symphony playing in his head, which was a little off-putting: She tasted like country-and western music... / He heard harmonicas and washboards, cowbells and tambourines. / In her body, he supped the history of song. And Im just not a fan of silly non-swearing: McDang, son, Holy jungle jaguar, motherjamming - this is rarely done well and just comes off juvenile & unrealistic.

She appears to have it all: a loving family, a dream job in one of L.A.s hottest eateries, and a gorgeous boyfriend dying to slip an engagement ring on her finger. So why does she feel so empty, like shes looking for a missing piece she cant find?

  The answer comes when a lawyer tracks down Quinn and reveals a bombshell secret and a mysterious inheritance that only she can claim. This shocking revelation washes over Quinn like a tidal wave. Her whole life has been a lie.

  On impulse, Quinn gives up her job, home, and boyfriend. She heads up the coast to the small hometown of Wildstone, California, which is just a few hours north, but feels worlds apart from Los Angeles. Though she doesnt quite fit in right away, she cant help but be drawn to the towns simple pleasuresand the handsome, dark-haired stranger who offers friendship with no questions asked.

  As Quinn settles into Wildstone, she discovers theres another surprise in store for her. The inheritance isn't a house or money, but rather something earthshattering, something that will make her question everything she thought she knew about herself, about her family. Now with a world of possibilities opening up to Quinn, she must decide if this new life is the one she was always meant to haveand the one that could finally give her the fulfillment shes searched so long for.

My Thoughts: Unsettled by the bombshell news she receives at the beginning of Lost and Found Sisters, Quinn will struggle to accept the secrets of the past and develop connections she had never anticipated.

Wildstone feels like the kind of story book small town, in which news travels quickly from one hour to the next, and the people who live in the town feel friendly and warm. Except for the ones who are not.

Quinn is a likable character, and I had to admire how she dealt with everything, especially the most unexpected aspect of the lawyers news.

But as she begins to feel at home with her new normal, she also has to learn that not everyone in small town life is kind. Not everyone has good intentions. But with the love of her own team of supporters, she finds a way to fill the empty spaces inside. She finds a way to start over. A lovely story of building a family, overcoming the past, and making new connections. 4.5 stars.",1514505600,4

5171,711,1542,"There are many possible ways and means purported to reveal how mankind will be wiped off the earth. Some are realistic and come from the prophecies of literal geniuses like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking. Many emerge from the extremely fertile and occasionally overactive minds of fiction writers.

If you were to name insects as being the primary cause for the demise of mankind, you would be on a very plausible track. After all, insects do greatly outnumber humans --- and make up over 80% of life --- on planet Earth. On this account, bestselling author James Rollins suggests that an ancient breed of insects that have always been on the planet may be our grim reapers. In fact, they have never died out and may very well be immortal.

The latest novel in the terrifically entertaining Sigma Force series, THE DEMON CROWN, speaks to death by insect --- but not in an oversimplified way. Rollins has always been an expert researcher, a fact that is displayed in the Truth or Fiction section he typically adds to the end of his books, and the most frightening thing about his thrillers is that there is more truth than fiction involved in his storytelling.

The Notes from the Historical Record section that opens the book immediately sets the credibility meter on this tale of fiction. We are catapulted back to the year 1903, and the historical figures of note are James Smithson, for whom the Smithsonian Institution is named after, and our telephone creator, Alexander Graham Bell. In fact, it is an alleged criminal act on the part of Bell that is the focus here. He allegedly flew to Genoa, Italy, where he dug up and took the remains of Smithson and brought them back to the U.S. where he buried them underneath the Smithsonian Castle. Why did he do this? You will need to continue reading this terrific thriller for those clues.

Now, as we jump back to the present, the current threat to humanity is allegedly detailed in Smithson's diary and journals. Within those pages, you can find reference to something called the Demon Crown, an ominous phrase that will be explained in the coming early chapters. Bell stated, Be warned, what the Demon Crown holds is very much alive and ready to unleash the very hordes of Hell upon this world.

Literally, the Demon Crown referred to the bones of an ancient insect that came together to form a ghastly halo above the skull bone. This globe-trotting novel takes us to Tokyo, Japan, where a 94-year-old named Takashi Ito has long harbored a plot to put Japan back on top of the world and bring the other nations of the globe to their knees. His revenge is also spurred, in part, as a final tip of the hat to his long-deceased love, Miu.

We then are laid on a private beach on the island Hana, part of Maui, Hawaii. The commander of Sigma Force, Grayson ""Gray"" Pierce, is there with his love, Seichen. After their last adventure, they wanted to take some time for themselves. Instead, they had watched three months go by in their self-imposed isolation and still felt no inkling towards returning to Sigma and that life. That is, however, until a deadly mass of killer wasps came at them, surrounding their island and attacking. Regrettably, Seichen is stung and has no idea what insect did it or how deadly the sting actually was.

Gray gets a message to his boss, Painter Crowe, in Washington D.C., alerting him about this mysterious insect swarm. The rest of Sigma Force are brought up to speed, and they all begin to do what they can to get answers. The challenge is that the team is scattered around the globe, and none of them realize the extremely short window of time they have to understand and prevent a potential life-ending cataclysm from burying the earth in death from above.

Kat and Monk, two other Sigma Force members, hook up with a professor from Cornell University, Ken Matsui, who is an expert on various venomous life on the planet, among other things. Matsui calls the insect swarm, which has now been determined to be wasps, the Odokuro, a term that refers to a Japanese demon named Gashadokuro. He is shrewd enough to know that the Odokuro must be stopped and prevented from mating and multiplying lest they quickly gain enough momentum to threaten all life on the planet in a matter of days. The most frightening fact about these ancient insects is that they are supposedly immortal.

Sigma Force begins to work at breakneck speed to save the world. Gray is especially determined because the stings Seichen received give her just a few days before the poisonous toxins do unspeakable damage to her body and ultimately claim her life. What is even more horrible is that she has revealed to all that she is with child.

Things move quickly here, and Rollins puts his literary foot on readers throats, forcing them to read on no matter how horrific the subject matter is. It's not so much recognizing that the Sigma Force team will probably live to fight another day as it is marveling at what they need to accomplish to defeat this threat, which may be the most daunting of their careers. THE DEMON CROWN is another fine Sigma Force novel that once again will leave readers in awe while giving them the impetus for many future nightmares.

5180,946,1281,"One Snowy Night is a quick little Heartbreaker Bay Christmas themed novella that definitely put me in the Christmas spirit. Jill Shalvis delivered another book that I enjoyed reading because of the characters and storyline. Ive grown fond of this series and definitely want to keep reading it back to back before the next book comes out soon. I only wish One Snowy Night wouldve been a longer story though. I wanted more of Rory, Max, and Maxs dog Carl, especially Carl. 

Rory is trying to make it home for Christmas with her family and Max promised to get her home on time for Christmas. Unfortunately, a snowstorm derails them getting there, but it does get Rory and Max together to share their true feelings with each other. Rory and Max have been dealing with an issue with each other since they were teenagers. They also have a lot of lust towards each other, but are afraid to admit it. Lets just say theres quite a bit of tension between these two and when they finally get close to each other its definitely steamy.

Overall, this novella was great to read, but everything happened so fast at the end between Max and Rory. There also was Rorys family and how their relationship was so rocky, but then all was forgiven. I wouldve liked Rorys and Maxs story to be a full length novel. Im glad though they were both introduced in The Trouble with Mistletoe because I definitely liked to getting to know them a bit before One Snowy Night. Im also glad that at least Ill get more of them in the next books in the series.

I give this book 3.5 stars and highly recommend this novella and the series to Contemporary Romance readers out there. Christmas may be over with, but this novella will definitely get you back in the spirit again and lets not forget the previous book that also is Christmas themed.",1514592000,4

Alderheart even thought his own sister, Sparkpelt, was wrong just because, she didn't agree with him. That and we don't learn RiverClan's opinion due to closed borders, a measure that's unnecessary due to the rogues being gone.

On another note, I was left with a huge question soon after reading. What was the whole point of the aforementioned Super Edition when almost nothing changed? I wanted to see their reactions when Tigerheart returned as a leader. (I guess that'll have to wait.) However, I kept reading and figured that this novel would help answer questions I have.

Of course, those two things weren't the only dumb things I read. There was Twigpaw's question about tails. At least, Finpaw pointed out that they're used for balance. Her response was that only mouse-brains need them. Wait a minute. When did using your instincts equate to low intelligence? Speaking of Twigpaw, I thought that if she liked him, she could've at least shown him some pity. That shouldn't have turned him into a moper because, disabled people don't want that. (Yes, I met a few and none of them had a ""Woe is me!"" attitude.)

Speaking of annoying characters, I thought her sister, Violetpaw, deserved a mention. I thought she was alright and even felt a little bad for her until she met Tree.and called him 'impossible'. Why would she do that? He just didn't believe her right away. She also called him arrogant just because, he was calm around her Clanmates. Why shouldn't have been when even though they weren't trying to hide their hostility, they weren't going to attack him. Also, when did calm and arrogant become synonyms?

Furthermore, I thought it was a case of the pot calling the kettle black. and it showed a case of indoctrination. Yes, I've talked with a few people have underwent that because, they seemed less-than-pleased when I questioned them. Keep in mind that I tried my hardest not to be rude because, they were nice to me-for the most part.

On that note, I felt that Leafpool deserved a mention for telling Alderheart to listen to StarClan. Never mind that their advice is always cryptic. Then again, I felt that's easier than making her own decision.

On another note, SkyClan's latest naming ceremony left me with mixed feelings. First off, Violetshine's one of the dumbest names I've ever read. (That's saying a lot because, I've been keeping up with the series, so I've seen bad and non-traditional ones.) That and Leafstar's overreaction almost made me stop reading. That was until I realized that Twigpaw's decision took a lot of courage. Keep in mind that she was torn from the beginning. That and Finpaw decided to come along with her. I figured that their relationship could grow without anybody trying to keep them apart.

On the contrary, there were a couple of things to like. First off, the Erins avoided the slippery slope of bringing characters back just because a body wasn't found. Also, there's a chance for Needletail to go to StarClan.",1514592000,2

5204,231,1451,"This will be the last book I finish in 2017, and its a doozy.
Set on the fictional Polynesian island named Pala, this is a kind of bookend to Huxleys classic futuristic masterpiece, Brave New World (1932), and was Huxleys final novel. On Pala life is peaceful and happy, with scientific and technological advancements blended with a way of living that is heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy and branches of Buddhism. Peace and harmony, a tropical utopia.

Not the typical novel, there isn't an obvious direct conflict or much physical action. It is more a philosophical journey for the main character, Will Farnaby, a journalist on a secret mission to secure a contract for oil drilling on Pala. Will wants nothing more than to get the contract and a large personal financial bonus for himself. The closest neighboring island, Rendang-Lobo, is ruled by Colonel Dipa, a military dictator who is hellbent on modernizing his kingdom, and threatens Palas peaceful way of life. Will arrives after being washed ashore after a shipwreck, shortly before Palas new ruler will be assuming control. The young heir to the throne, Murugan, is a spoiled young fool, completely under his devious mothers thumb - and Murugan is envious of Rendang-Lobos new modernization and its embracing of ideas from the outside world; he wants to see Pala mimic Colonel Dipas economic and social goals.

Thats the overall thrust of the plot, but theres so much underneath: how can societies exist with consumerism and greed? What responsibility do societys members have to each other? And ideas about ecology, overpopulation and mysticism are a central part of Will Farnaby's growth as a character. There is a lot here, and after reading this, Aldous Huxley instantly became a favorite author for me.

While this novel will probably never get the recognition of Brave New World, I was completely bowled over after reading it. I really favor this novel over Brave New World - no mean feat because that book is superb and Ive loved it for years - but the ideas in Island were quite profound and will have me thinking for a long while. And it is amazing that it was published in 1962. Will Humans ever learn? I doubt it. Excellent book, highest recommendation.",1514678400,5

5216,302,1371,"The Keeper of Lost Things by Ruth Hogan is a highly recommended debut novel that follows the lives of two British assistants and explores connections between people.

Anthony Peardew is an elderly writer and the keeper of lost things. He hired Laura, an unhappy 35-year-old divorce, as an assistant, several years earlier and they have a compatible, understanding working relationship. Peardew lost the love of his life, Therese forty years ago, on the same day he lost a keepsake she had given him. Since that time he has been quietly collecting and cataloguing any lost things he finds, storing them in his study in Padua, the Victorian villa where he lives and works. He also writes stories about these lost items.

In 1970 Eunice finds a job as a publisher's assistant for the charming Bomber. This also marked the start of their life-long friendship. Bomber owns a small publishing house where he only publishes books that he likes, while also studiously avoiding any of the manuscripts sent to him by his sister, Portia, whose work features blatantly plagiarized plots.

When Anthony Peardew dies, he leaves his estate and Padua to Laura. He also instructs her to try and find the owners of the lost things he has so carefully collected. With help from Freddy the gardener, and Sunshine, the young woman with Down syndrome who lives across the street, Laura sets out to follow Anthony's wishes. When the ghost of Therese begins to act up, she knows that she is missing some vital clue.

With alternating chapters, the novel follows the stories of Laura and Eunice. Interspersed among the chapters are some of the short stories that Anthony wrote about the lost things he found. There are parts of this novel that are charming, delightful, and clever. And there are parts that stretch credulity and belief.

The quality of the writing in this debut novel is really quite good. It is humorous, touching, emotional, and clever. The descriptions are wonderful. The two plots/timelines are both equally interesting. The short stories written about the items are compelling and become a part of the whole story. The Keeper of Lost Things truly is a charming story, slow to start but then it quickly picks up and is an enjoyable novel, with some romance and a pleasant plot. There is a lot of tea made and consumed.

The characters are well developed, including the minor characters and the dogs. Freddie is an obvious romantic interest and Sunshine is a compatible, amicable sidekick. Portia is suitably reprehensible. The dogs are all quite brilliant characters who add a special charm to the novel. Of the two, I was actually more interested in and intrigued by Bomber and Eunice's story. I liked them both and was sad to say goodbye to them. My credulity was stretched with the ghost, Laura's romance with Freddy, and Sunshine's psychic ability.

This is an agreeable, light novel that is easy to follow and as cozy as a cup of hot tea on a winter's day. The caliber of the writing elevates it above an average rating for me, but personally I would have enjoyed more Eunice and Bomber.

5218,138,1684,"The Hundreds Years War, a conflict between a French faction supported by England and the House of Valois, was notable for its length, spanning generations, for the scorched earth tactics employed by the Burgundians/English, and for the myth arising around a young child savior, Joan of Arc. In Lidia Yuknavitchs dystopian novel, Joan finds herself resurrected in the person of a girl who rather than deriving her powers from religious visions obtains them as a result of her oneness with dirt, that is the Earth, encompassing all its powers of creation.

In the beginning, Joan misuses her power as she wages a war of total destruction again an evil, insane, charismatic Jean de Men. As the mythic Joan fell into the hands of Burgundians, so Jean de Men captures Joan. Similar to Joan of Arc, de Men puts her on a showy trial and executes her by fire at the stake. The result, of course, is the opposite of his intension and Joan becomes both legend and hope encapsulated in a book engraved by electrocautery on the skin of Christine Pizan. Christine knows a secret, that Joan did not perish, and its Christines mission to defeat de Men and allow Joan to use her powers of fecundity to restore the world, much as it was those supporting Joan of Arc to use her to produce an independent France.

Yuknavitch conjures some pretty striking images, particularly of Jean de Mens domaine, a suborbital city, CIEL, in the sky populated by a class of horribly mutated humans, white hairless beings devoid of sexuality, unable to reproduce themselves, who exit to exit, and who scribe their existence on their skin and skin graphs that hang from them like robes. CIEL hovers above a burned over world, one denuded of vegetation, a ball of brown dirt. Underneath that bare surface, ragtag groups of survivors exist, many of them awaiting a savior they know will return with the power to make things whole again.

Now, to enjoy Yuknavitchs novel, readers have to put logic aside, because her world is quite fantastical. It defies logic, much in the way destroying your own planet by polluting it and ravaging it with wars does, and by restricting, subjugating, and punishing those who give and nurture life does. In this regard, Yuknavitch makes a dramatic point. Unfortunately, if things get too out of hand, too much like she envisions here, there will be no savior at the ready to put things right again, at least not for millions of years.",1514678400,4

5220,251,1474,"I adore the Keeping Up with the Cavendishes series, and this fourth book is a worthy and fulfilling finale. This could probably be read as a decent standalone, but I do not recommend that because to do so would be to miss out on one of the most unique and appealing aspects of this book and series.

There are four Cavendish siblings, specifically James and his three sisters. Each book in this series focuses on one of the siblings, with the twist that the stories occur simultaneously. It is beyond fun to read about events, including a particular ball, from the different perspective of each sibling.

Adding to the fun of this series is that each sibling is a strong and intriguing character, engaged in supremely interesting situations and encountering worthy love matches. As Americans recently transplanted to England after James unexpectedly becomes the Duke of Durham, opportunities abound for clashes of will and the potential for scandal.

This is the most serious book of the quartet, partly due to James's personality and his position as the newly named Duke. He has much to wrestle with, as does his love, Meredith, who is employed as a companion in his household. The affection and relationship among the Cavendish siblings is a strength throughout this series, as is their strong spirit. I was full of anticipation for this story from the first book of the series, and was not disappointed. This tied everything together in a satisfying way.",1514678400,5

5222,937,1281,"One Snowy Night is a Christmas novella story in the Heartbreaker Bay series.  While its not a long story it does pack an emotional punch nonetheless.

Weve been aware of the flirting actions between Rory and Max, well if not true flirting then definitely aware of each other.  Really, how many trips to the groomer does one dog need in a month?  That should have been a giveaway to Rory but shes too busy trying to blend into the woodwork and not be seen as the teenager in trouble that she once was.  She and Max have a history but Rory doesnt know the full story and thats about to change when Willa bulldozed a ride for Rory back to her family with Max.

I liked Rory, shes made mistakes, shes also stood up for herself knowing that she also got someone in trouble back then, but she didn't know who until now.  Shes pulled herself up, with help from new friends, and is building a life for herself.  Her feelings for Max were supposed to be her secret, but that changes when she learns a few truths about the past and the present from Max on their long, dangerous trip home.

One Snowy Night proves that you cant know the whole story until you hear both sides of it.  And letting go of the past can be a very freeing experience that just might lead you to the love of a lifetime.  Id recommend this one for any Romance reader who enjoys a good love story, but can also enjoy the basics of falling in love.

5225,801,16,"I now understand why The Hate U Give is so popular. It is a story that ticks all the right boxes -- it is powerful, engaging and timely. It is well-written with a main character readers will root for and it doesn't shy away from confronting big issues.

Through her story, Thomas educates her readers about issues such as prejudice, police brutality as well as black culture, racism (both intentional and inadvertent), white privilege and cultural appropriation. The discussions of these issues aren't always comfortable to read (nor should they be) but the story is compelling and sadly, these issues continue to be prevalent today.

The story revolves around Starr Carter, a black teenager who witnesses her friend being gunned down by a white police officer. The effects of this tragedy are shown through Starr's eyes but readers also see how the tragedy affects Starr's community and family as well as the disparate views of her classmates in the mainly white private school she attends. These reactions vary from emotionally charged and shocked to apathetic, ignorant and censured. Through these differing viewpoints, Thomas reveals a social and political commentary of these issues.

The writing is strong, and the characters are diverse and well fleshed out. Starr is a resilient young woman and the reader witnesses how she learns to harness her inner strength and find the power of her own voice. The story addresses many of Starr's relationships - some of which are quite complicated. From her family life, to her friends at home and at school, Starr struggles to figure out where she fits in. Her family is a huge source of her strength and their bonds, humour and fierce devotion to each other show where Starr gets much of her strength and tenacity.

The Hate U Give is a book that needs to be read. It educates its readers within a compelling, raw and eye-opening story filled with characters you'll swear are real. It's a book about family, community, friendship and loyalty as much as it's a book about racism, fear and abuse of power.",1514678400,5
5226,946,935,"Im finishing up 2017 with a review of Accidentally on Purpose by Jill Shalvis and Im so glad I finished this book before 2018 began. This by far may be my favorite of the series (so far, I should say). Now I have a couple more books to read before the new book is released in January. Lets see if any other couple can win me over like Elle and Archer did.

I was beyond excited to read Elles and Archers story. These two became a favorite of mine the minute they were introduced in the first book because they definitely had a thing going on between them and I wanted to know more about their back stories. Elle is definitely a woman who is determined to conquer the world on her own, but unfortunately shes got Archer always there helping her. Shes determined to kick his butt if he doesnt let her life. Shes my favorite due to how she handles Archer. She knows how to put him in his place and she also knows how to throw any other guy in a loop with her personality and looks. Every guy is scared of her because of Archer.

The heat between these two was definitely crazy. Archer and Elle in the same room together, lets just say fireworks went off, although they always claimed nothing was going on. The minute Elle starts seeing other guys is when Archer shows his alpha side. Archer was definitely a favorite because he knew how to handle Elle. He also knew how to keep his feelings hidden from Elle, which frustrated everyone and Elle more.

The back stories between these two kept me turning the pages. I couldn't wait, when these two finally hooked up. LOVE! Believe me this book had a lot of drama (some of it family drama), tension, and humor.

I give this book 5 stars and highly recommend it to Contemporary Romance readers out there. Now I need to start reading the next book in this series. I love this series by Jill Shalvis. ",1514678400,5
5227,828,1686,"Having seen the Mont Blancs anchor along North West Arm five miles from the point of detonation Great is not the first word that comes to mind. The author begins his story with the founding of Halifax in 1749 and documents the citys dependence on the military and navy for its prosperity. When war breaks out in 1914 Halifax importance as a rendezvous point for Convoys headed for Europe which anchored in Bedford Bason, a body of water Ive driven by repeatedly, makes it an obvious target for German U-boats and its defence a priority. Ive also visited the installations on McNabs Island that gated the port.

In alternating chapters trench warfare in Europe is brought home to us through the letters of a young soldier from Wolfville. As traffic in Halifax Harbour confined to 10 hours a day increased and the inadvisability of munitions ships making themselves targets by flying red flags, coupled with a limited supply of harbour pilots and failing communications made harbour security tenuous the harbour master informed his superiors that he could not be responsible for possible accidents. His warnings went unheeded.

5229,238,660,"Fantastic book by Becky Albertalli, after reading Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda I became her fan, her writing just goes directly into my heart, the way she is able to make us care for her characters to the level she does is outstanding, and I think is because her stories seem real and her characters also seem real and vulnerable that is easy to find some kind of connection with them.

It has been a long time since I could fully connect with a character the way I connected with Molly, many times I found myself thinking about how often I used to say the things she was saying in the book or feeling the way she was feeling in the book, it was so refreshing to see a character like her, not perfect or trying to be, just real, taking it one day at a time and trying to find connections with people but at the same time being afraid of the world and what life has in store for us.

The relationship between Molly and her twin sister was my favorite and I think that its because that has happened to me in the past, you grow up with someone are best friends but life sometimes pulls you a part or maybe you don't feel as close but you are there for each other no matter what because every relationship has its ups and downs and you have to roll with the punches but also be really aware if the relationship is worth working on or not.

The romantic aspect of the book was super cute! The interactions between them made me smile every time, the flirting was so dorky and the only way I can describe it is with smiley faces and heart emojis.

We also have some cool connection with Simon vs, and a little cameo with Simon himself, maybe its just me that didn't know about this already but I always freaking happy when I made the connection.

To sum up, I LOVED this book and I cant even begin to imagine how amazing her next book is going to be.",1514678400,5

5233,187,76,"What a wonderful novel. What marvelous prose. I likened Amor Towles writing style to the writers of yesteryear. I cant remember when I read a modern novel that matched his artistry as a wordsmith. Add his storytelling ability to the above talents and walah, you have his second New York Times bestseller. The story is well thought out: In 1922, a aristocrat, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, returns to Moscow after a four year stay in Paris. He finds himself now a enemy of the ruling party of Bolsheviks (the Worker's Party) led by Vladimir Lenin. The last Tsar, Nicholas II is dead and so is the conception of royalty and their privileged lifestyle. It seems the Count wrote a poem, Where is it now? in 1913 (four years before the fall of the Tsar). The poem had nothing to do with Lenins revolution, but the Emergency Committee of the Peoples Commissariat for Internal Affairs accused the Count of writing against the Worker Party. The partys prosecutor wants to know if the Count came back with the intention of taking up arms and, if so, whether for or against the Revolution. The Count says, By that point, Im afraid that my days of taking up arms were behind me. The prosecutor wants to know what Rostovs occupation is. Rostov says, It is not the business of gentlemen to have occupations. The Prosecutor then asks, Very well then. How do you spend your time? Rostov says, Dining, discussing. Reading, reflecting. The usual rigmarole. Im only on page five and I was hooked already.

Later on on page five and six, the Committee decides the Counts fate after a twelve minute recess, Alexander Ilyich Rostov, taking into full account your own testimony, we can only assume that the clear-eyed spirit who wrote the poem Where is it now? has succumbed irrevocably to the corruptions of his class-and now poses a threat to the very ideals he once espoused. On that basis, our inclination would be to have you taken from this chamber and put against the wall. But there are those within the senior ranks of the Party who count you among the heroes of the pre-revolutionary cause. Thus, it is the opinion of this committee that you should be returned to the hotel of which you are so fond. But make no mistake: should you ever set foot outside the Metropol again, you will be shot. Next Matter. Its obvious that the Bolsheviks want the remaining royalty silenced. By the way, The Metropol is a real luxury hotel in Moscow. Is this a great idea for a novel or what? Can the Count live in a hotel for the rest of his life with no hope of enjoying his customary stroll around Theatre Square? After his sentencing, he is escorted back to the hotel, but not to his luxury suite. His new living quarters will be a small attic room that will not fit all his stuff (for the lack of a better word). He takes some of his furniture and possessions up stairs...the rest of his belongings are now the property of the people.

 On page 16, the Metropol Hotel employees were bewildered: When he had been carted off that morning, they had all assumed that he would never return. He had emerged from behind the walls of the Kremlin like an aviator from the wreckage of a crash. Since the Count had already resided in the hotel for four years, he knew all the employees by name. My dear friends, said the Count, no doubt you are curious as to the days events. As you may know, I was invited to the Kremlin for a tete-a-tete. There, several duly goateed officers of the current regime determined that for the crime of being born an aristocrat, I should be sentenced to spend the rest of my days...in this hotel. Everybody cheered! So at this point (page 16), the novel starts for real. The author turns the Counts next 30 plus years in the hotel into an exciting and intriguing filled drama. You will become familiar with the hotels restaurants, bars and employees; its famous and not so famous guests, but most of all you will get the flavor of communisms early years. Its almost like the movie, Casablanca, but not played out in Ricks bar (do you remember the bars owner, Humphrey Bogart?), but played out in the Metropol Hotel with the undertones of communism instead of Casablancas Nazi atmosphere. Overall, I was mesmerized by Amor Towles story and extraordinary prose. Get your copy now...you will not be sorry.",1514678400,5

5239,471,1689,"Well, that sure was disappointing. And worst of all, 400 pages of disappointing.

I get the schtick: it's a fantasy story about reading fantasy stories. The first half (which is way better than the second half) is a sendup to the Hero's Journey with Atreyu, while the second half is Bastian exploring our relationship with reading, fantasies, and wishes. Maybe if I was twelve again, I'd appreciate the little jokes and quick transitions between weird scenes. But it's just too looong to be following a thunderously uninteresting and whiny character like Bastian. Everyone interesting --the Childlike Empress, Atreyu, Falkor, Gmork, etc-- just wanders off and left me feeling like I was frittering my time with pointless scenes.

Again, the first half was an interesting setup, and the very beginning of the second half gave me an ""Oh shoot! Is that what they're doing?!"" moment, but then things just...happen. I'm all for celebrating the human imagination and the power of stories, but bless any child or adult that can stay completely interested the whole time (as an older reader, you'll see the ending coming 200 miles/pages away).

To be honest, if I was reading this to a kid? I'd stop at chapter 12. It's a nice, thoughtful, deconstructive moment about books inside books, while leaving enough for the imagination to still chew on. I'll give this three stars and pretend the rest of the book didn't happen.",1514678400,3

5253,258,1364,"This was a very engaging and emotional read. A very easy read... YA for adults, really.  The F-bomb is aggressively dropped multiple times and there are complicated adult issues at play here.  But I've read there is a cleaned up YA edition out there.

This is a story narrated by Christopher Boone, a 15 yr old who is most definitely somewhere on the autism spectrum.  He's also a savant (and intends to get a degree in math or physics someday). But none of these labels or words are ever used in the story.  This is the case even though he is quite sheltered and attends a special education school, works closely with a teacher to manage and cope with his struggles... and even though he displays so many hallmarks of someone on the spectrum.  I guess that's why neighbors and cops and everyone else (including his parents) don't understand him... the word simply doesn't exist in Haddon's world (yes, I'm being sarcastic).

And we've seen this trend in other popular books and TV shows where a character is clearly on the spectrum but the word is never uttered (e.g., Bones, The Rosie Project).  The noble BS emotionally manipulative excuse being that labels are too limiting....

Limiting for who?  Like not uttering the word is somehow going to magically normalize and/or create acceptance for individuals with autism??  What?!  As if this refers to the character. pfft.  LABELS ARE TOO LIMITING FOR WRITERS!!!  Writers who don't wish to take any responsibility or accountability for the characters they create and the ideas they give to the public about people on the autism spectrum.

I believe Christopher is a composite of many things.  I also think we can place him under the Rain Man trope.  Let's face it... it's a very fun one to see play out.  The book is fun to read.  It's even been made into a play.  But make no mistake, most people on the spectrum are not like Christopher.  Not all people with autism are savants. And, not all savants have autism. I've read that approximately 50-75% of savants are some level of autistic. I've also read that maybe 10% of those with autism have some kind of savant abilities.  Just sayin'.... our acceptance or understanding shouldn't be based on these cliches and tropes.

Reading about this author took me down the same road as reading about Graeme Simsion (author of The Rosie Project).  Both guys outright claim the book is not about someone with Asperger's... and then they say it is elsewhere.  Both say they did no research for the main character and then they contradict themselves elsewhere (Haddon's bio states he's worked with special needs individuals).

I think some people get in over their heads and want to avoid pitchfork wielding mobs for their creations.  So leave the diagnosis open-ended and let the public decide... stump the public by making the word invisible.

This is my main issue with the book... and all stories that erase the word.  Sure it's fun...  but it's also kind of irresponsible in a time where autism is becoming more prevalent and people are being fed these magical brain wizard heroic unicorn cliches.  Just sayin'...

I did enjoy the plot.  It wasn't what I thought it was going to be about at all.  It does start out as an odd murder mystery of who killed the neighbor's dog... but that is merely an event that sets Christopher onto a path of discovery about his family and his own capabilities.  It sets him on a journey out into the world.  It's a coming-of-age story.  If anything, the dead dog is more of a symbol of his loss of innocence-- one that haunts his soul (Hello, Hounds of Baskervilles!).  A journey where we are planted in Christopher's mind and can see how he copes with people and life in general... and the fascinating way numbers and colors play a role in his routines and how he copes with his limitations and understanding of the world.  It's also a sensitive and realistic look about how difficult it is for parents to take care of a special needs child.

Fans of Sherlock Holmes get plenty of perks. Christopher loves the stories and identifies with the detective. The title itself is taken from some dialogue in the short story ""The Adventures of Silver Blaze"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  The Hound of the Baskervilles is often alluded to... and I'm sure if I knew the story well I'd find a lot more of it in Haddon's.",1514764800,4

5256,1024,234,"Ive wanted to read this book for quite some time. And with the release of the Hulu series, my desire to read it increased. So when my friend and I were putting together our book club list, we both had it at the top of our choices. I can see why it has taken the world by storm and especially in light of recent political events.

The Handmaids Tale drops you into a world where things have drastically changed. The Constitution is no longer in effect and religion rules. We follow a woman, a Handmaid, named Offred. Although thats not her real name, but women now are called by their owners name. Women are no longer allowed to read, or write, or even form friendships. The Handmaids are even more strict about what women can and cant do because the Handmaids have the important task of procreation.

Its hard not to read this novel and see how the world could come to this point. Margaret Atwood wrote The Handmaids Tale in 1986 and it holds lessons that are true even now. The characters are unique and its quite easy to become attached to our main character. While Atwood does a wonderful job portraying what could be, my one complaint is that the ending is too sudden. Understandably so, but I wish we had more to go on. I wish that at least a good majority of the loose-ends were tied up. While I would have prefered a more solid ending, I cant ignore how timeless this story is.",1514764800,4

5258,466,249,"I am probably the last member of my generation to read this book, but better late than never, as they say. Of course this is a classic and I have no new critical insight to add. I started out listening to the audiobook version and ended up reading it on Kindle. I am not a big fan of it as a story. I found it really hard to relate to the characters and the storytelling just felt stiff to me. What I liked about this book is the look it gives into societal issues that have been with us forever, like discrimination, and the issues that could very soon become a reality, like cloning. Regarding the science portrayed, I think it is important as individuals and as members of a larger society, to consider the potential future implications of the scientific developments that seem to be coming at us fast and furious. In this book, the government has become the parents of every member of society and children are trained to do one thing and one thing only. Is that something we really want? The idea expressed of peace at all costs seems to be too high a price to pay. And yet, I fear that some of our current leaders would take us down just that path. If nothing else, this book provides a jumping off point for some very important discussions. But most importantly, it gives a glimpse of a future that is not so far-fetched in the 21st century as it was when the 1930s.

The discrimination issue also stood out to me very strongly. It seems like we have been talking about this issue forever and yet it never goes away. In my lifetime, Ive seen the employment discrimination laws passed and affirmative action go in and out of favor. I also know that one of the ways that our brains organize our world is by discriminating red from blue, and apple from orange. In my opinion, its not the concept thats wrong but the application. The way it is used in this story, to dictate the path of an individuals life, is blatantly wrong and a violation of what it means to be human. The value of this presentation is that it gives the reader an opportunity, if they take it, to evaluate their own ways of discriminating and determine if they go too far. Because we are individuals, we should always be evaluating each other as individuals, not groups.

I appreciate this book for the issues it addresses, and the thinking that it engenders. I think it is still relevant for readers of today and I encourage anyone who hasn't yet picked it up to do so.",1514764800,4
5259,484,143,"For me, this was a complicated mystery. I don't think I could fully comprehend how this murder played out or the intricacies of all the little clues that eventually led to the murderer. The time, the clock, the real note, the fake note, the murder weapon, the alibis of all the individuals suspected, the series of events it took to make it happen and so on were all things that I found slightly difficult to follow.

I felt the crime itself and the time it took to solve it were overly dragged in some parts. I thought this would be a quick book to read, but it took longer than expected, and yes, I finally got to meet the fabulous Miss Marple. An elderly maid, who lives alone, and has a knack at studying people and their behaviors, which helps her notice and see things that others wouldn't normally pay attention to. She is known as a busybody, who likes to involve herself in everything, making observations everywhere she goes, and more importantly, she is ALWAYS right.

I tried to like this book, I really did. I've always been told how everyone prefers Hercule Poirot to Miss Marple, and I really wanted them to be wrong and end up liking her and enjoy her detective work. I didn't though. Not this one anyway. I'm not sure if it's because it's her first appearance, and so, Agatha Christie, was really just trying to lay down the foundations for future books and just using this story to introduce us to her. She showed up intermittently throughout the story, appearing only in a handful of scenes, so it was difficult to get a good read on her character and her involvement in solving the case. Not being a detective and just a regular by-stander and nosy neighbor snooping around the village, it had a completely different vibe and feel to the Hercule Poirot books, in which he could formally get involved in the crime as a detective, working closely with the police force to solve the case.

I think, were it a different story, with a different plot, and more Miss Marple, I would have enjoyed her detective work a lot more than Poirot's, because she's relatable. She's me and you and every reader out there trying to read the clues and figure out who did it. That's pretty cool, if you think about it - an old lady with nothing better to do than people watching. I definitely haven't given up on Miss Marple yet, and plan to read more of her.

I just found out through another reviewer that Miss Marple's next book comes twelve years after this one, which makes me wonder how different the writing and the style would be. It's almost like Christie waited that long to recreate the character, so I'm looking forward to getting into the next Miss Marple.",1514764800,2

All The Bright Places is one of those books that leaves a mark. It affects your life in a way that some books are incapable of. Jennifer Niven weaves a tale of young love and loss.

Violet is a senior who lost her one and only sister in a car accident. The world is telling her to move on but she cant seem to find the way. She had big plans for her future but after her sisters death shes lost and unsure.

Finch is a boy still trying to find himself without losing his foothold on this world. He gets lost sometimes but always finds a way back. Then one day, he finds Violet. She becomes an anchor for him. Someone he can turn to when he feels himself floating away. In contrast, Finch becomes Violets wings. He takes her to places she never would have dreamed of visiting right in their own state. He teaches her to climb mountains and that its ok to move on without forgetting the ones we lost.

While focusing on the tough subjects of teenagedom, Niven is elegant in her storytelling. She manages to create characters both lovable and personal.

5265,578,1690,"One of the great things about Christopher Moore novels is that you never really know where they're coming from or where they're going.  ""Noir"" is no exception to the rule.  Moore has picked what seems like an obscure period of recent history (1947) and a relatively quiet place at the time (San Francisco) as the setting for the novel.  Seems quirky at first, but there's a plan there as things get whacky and go whackier.  Central characters here are two of the walking wounded of WWII--Sammy the bartender and Stilton (aka The Cheese) a diner waitress, who fall for each other and are both the unlikely heroes and victims of the story's outlandish actions.

If that description isn't enough to whet your whistle, you can also look forward to some great moments with a Chinese sidekick (zoot-suited and slang-addicted), Uncle Ho, who has an unsavory affinity for cats, members of the Bohemian Club, the commander of the USAF Base at Roswell New Mexico, a profane seven-year old kid, the King of SF drag kings, Sammy's Black guardian angel, Thelonious Jones, and first among equals, Petey, the black mamba who is at the center of the action.  Also in the cast is the author's wildcard visitor, who cannot be mentioned in this review as it would take things too close to spoiler territory.

In the real world, Eliza Mirk is the epitome of introverted geek. She'd rather spend her time with her online friends and in her own fantasy world...a fantasy world where she happens to be known as LadyConstellation and has her own webcomic fanbase.

When Wallace Warland, Monstrous Seas biggest fanfiction writer, transfers to her school he's equally as introverted and socially awkward. As they bond over their love of Monstrous Sea, Wallace is slowly able to bring Eliza out of her shell...until Eliza's identity is accidentally shared with the world, and everythingher story, her relationship with Wallace, and even her sanitybegins to fall apart.

Excuse me while I go into fangirl mode here.

Eliza and Her Monsters is perfect for anyone that's ever been obsessed with a movie or show, the introverted, the socially awkward, and those that suffer from social anxiety. It deals with the conundrum that is online vs offline life and how sometimes people that aren't our people just don't get that. Also geeks. Webcomics. Fandoms. Cosplay. Dealing with our inner monsters. It sprinkles the story with art, character background inserts, forum profiles, and all manner of other super awesome things (and I'm not talking one or two)! I JUST...THIS BOOK. I CAN'T EVEN.

I ship Eliza+Wallace so hard.
""I found you in a constellation.""

Their friendship to relationship develops gradually and is so well done. They both have lots of anxiety issues but, while that's present, their relationship concentrates more on art, fanfiction, and learning to trust another enough to become friends who share the same passion. For the both of themand likely for a lot of readers that would love this bookthe internet is the safe haven that brought them together.

The internet and online friendship love is strong.
""I do have friends. Maybe they live hundreds of miles away from me, and maybe I can only talk to them through a screen, but they're still my friends. They don't just hold Monstrous Sea together. They hold me together.

Max and Emmy are the reason any of this exists.""

When I was younger, I used to spend countless hours on the computer...to the point where my parents were frustrated that I didn't spend enough time in the ""real world."" What they don't getand Eliza's parents don't getis that the internet was a place to explore, where I could be as invisible or not as I wanted, and where I could find others like me. Eliza and Her Monsters really highlights how great, healthy, and varied these relationships can be. This here is a book that actually gets me.

It isn't all unicorns and rainbows.
""There is a small monster in my brain that controls my doubt.
The doubt itself is a stupid thing, without sense or feeling, blind and straining at the end of a long chain. The monster, though, is smart. Its always watching, and when I am completely sure of myself, it unchains the doubt and lets it run wild. Even when I know its coming, I cant stop it.""

When Eliza's identity becomes known, her whole world is turned inside out. Her anonymity and her webcomicher safe havenget stripped away. Her parents don't understand her, Wallace feels betrayed, and the pressure from her fan base becomes overwhelming.

It adds an emotional depth to an otherwise light-hearted book. It was thought-provoking and lent a more serious edge befitting the issues instead of glossing overor even skippingthem entirely.

Recommended for everyone. Absolutely everyone.",1514764800,5

5275,798,657,"She wept because she did not know what she wanted, and because she wanted everything.

Hunted is a beautifully haunting retelling of Beauty and the Beast that follows the bones of the story while spinning a tale that is completely new and fresh as snow. I think this easily tops my favorite retelling for this particular tale.

Rating: 4.5/5 stars.

Yeva is the youngest of three sisters (nicknamed ""Beauty"") and grew up hunting with her father, listening to tales of fantastical creatures that reside in their wood. She lives and breathes the forest and, if forced to marry, longs for a husband that will admire her for her skills. When tragedy strikes, and the family loses their fortune, they're forced to sell their belongings and move back into the hunting cabin from their youth.

When their father doesn't return from a hunting trip, Yeva fears the worst and leaves her beloved sisters to track him. What she finds is more than she bargained for...a beast unlike any other and a whole world full of creatures she believed only fairytale. Yeva is determined to kill the beast and return to her family but her quest to kill the seemingly unkillable creature unveils secrets that leaves her struggling to understand what to believe and what world she really belongs to.

Backdropped in a rural, Russian-esque universe, the cold, snow, and ice provide the perfect stage for the duality prevalent throughout the book. The winter forest is both merciless and unyielding, yet surreal and magical.

The song wanted. It wanted in the way Yeva had always wanted, wanted not so much a thing as everything, something beyond naming, something more than, different, deeper. It was the want that kept her from saying yes to Solmir, though he offered her everything she could have named aloud; it was the want that brought her to the woods each day, the want that filled her dreams of some other life, something beyond what others desired; it was the want that screamed to the sky that shed give everything, all of herself and all shed ever be, to live one moment of that other life, the one she could not explain, not even to herself.

Yeva is a wonderfully complex, flawed, and capable main character. She's torn between duty and caring for her family versus seeking the life she wants. The Beast, for once, is not a man transformed beastly but two warring souls cursed to be one. As such, the slow burn romance is more of a gradual awakening to a depth of feeling neither realized as Beast's human soul gradually strengths over the wolf. While told in Beauty's POV, you get snapshots of Beast's evolving mindset interspersed every couple of chapters and it is alien, wonderful, and super effective.

I loved how close Yeva was to her sisters. I loved that Yeva was a strong, capable heroine but still humanly flawed. I loved the Beast and his evolution. I loved that the book didn't sidestep major issues like possible Stockholm Syndrome. I loved the fairytales within a fairytale. Most of all, I love that the moral of the story is so different from the usual: that life isn't a fairytale at all.

There's no such thing as living happily ever after  there's only living. We make the choice to do it happily.

Recommended for everyone. Especially those who like fairytale retellings, complex characters, and well-written stories.",1514764800,4
5276,1024,1055,"I had never had the pleasure of reading any of John Irvings books. Little did I know how much of a prolific writer he is. When I was younger, Id watched the movie Cider House Rules, but being that young I couldn't really appreciate it. Id like to go back and watch it again some day.

As part of the book club I take part in, A Prayer for Owen Meany was chosen. I was a bit dubious as to whether I would enjoy this story or not. I know they say never judge a book by its cover but I still tend to do so. And I was definitely not impressed with this one. Written in 1989 about two boys growing up in a small town of New Hampshire, I wasn't inspired to devour this book as quickly as I usually would.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. We are introduced to the two young characters, John Wheelwright and Owen Meany, as their friendship grows and the adventures they encounter through their years. The town of Gravesend is the setting for these youngsters as they learn to grow up through whatever life may throw at them. Tragedy strikes early and sometimes the boys seek out trouble of their own, but through it all they stick together.

Owen Meany, a strange little boy, is even stranger when it is revealed he thinks that he is Gods gift and that he was put here for a purpose. How many times have we wondered what our purpose is? And here is this young boy who already seems to know. Owens knowledge makes their escapades even more interesting.

Parts of Irvings book were a bit dry, and the story was a tad difficult to get into, but after a few pages, it was hard to put down. The ending is a bit predictable but A Prayer for Owen Meany certainly is thought provoking and entertaining.",1514764800,4
5277,508,1652,"Kasie West books are so addicting, every time I read her new one I wish 5 of them were published at the same time so I binge them. I have probably said this in a review for one of her books before, but her books are PERFECT for when I am in a reading slump, and this one did not fail me.
I definitely am not the biggest fan of books where there is unrequited love at the beginning, even if I know it is most likely going to end happy, so that would probably be my one complaint.
Other than getting angry at Cooper for not realizing what was right in front of him for 300 pages, I did seriously love this book. I loved how sarcastic Abby was, and her emails between her and her dad had me cracking up at some points.
I lied, there is another complaint, and that is I WANTED MORE. I feel like that is always how it is with contemporary books, I need more of the side characters, and I need more of the happy ending.",1514764800,5
5278,1024,1165,"I picked up A Study in Charlotte a while back and have been looking forward to reading for quite some time. Im a huge Sherlock fan and this book lived up to the legend, but don't be confused. It can easily stand on its own as a whole new take on the Holmes-Watson relationship.

Brittany Cavallaro brings her own spin on the history of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson with all new characters to love. Even though its a retake on a classic, Cavallaro doesnt leave out the wit and mystery that were so fond of from previous Holmes stories.

A Study in Charlotte brings to life Charlotte Holmes, the great-great-great-granddaughter of the famous Sherlock Holmes. Studying in Connecticut at a boarding school, she meets her counterpart James Watson (yes, that Watson). It isn't long before the two have found themselves in the midst of a murder case and they are the key suspects. In true Holmes fashion, Charlotte takes the lead in trying to get to the bottom of things while James becomes her sidekick. While Cavallaro borrows some stories from the original adventures, she manages to write her own version and the twist of a possible romance between Watson and Holmes adds a whole other layer to this novel.

Lovers of the original Holmes stories would do well to pick this one up! A Study in Charlotte is the first of a planned trilogy. I cant wait to pick up the second installment to see what Cavallaro has planned for our tag team.",1514764800,5
5279,493,1323,"If you are a fan of Jill Shalviss Heartbreaker Bay series, then youve been waiting for Sean ORileys story and Holiday Wishes. We have seen Sean grow over the first four books. He has always been the hearthrob that girls throw their panties at, but in this book we see a more mature Sean. He is in charge of throwing a co-ed bachelor weekend at a B&B in wine country for his brother and is determined that everything is going to be perfect. Of course, there are a couple of wrenches thrown into his plans. When they arrive at the B&B hes surprised to see Lottie, a girl he liked in high school.  After losing their virginity to each other as teenagers she moved away and Sean, being a typical young doofus, didn't keep in touch as he said he would. When Lottie sets eyes on Sean her first reaction is why now? Shes had a tough time of it lately and isn't about to risk her heart again to someone whos already disappointed her.

Sometimes a novella isn't long enough to do the characters justice. This is definitely not one of those times. The reason why this story works is because we knew Sean. Weve watched him change and mature over four books. Weve loved his relationship with his brother Finn, and that same warmth is given to Lottie. Its no wonder she didn't stand a chance against him!

You MUST read the other novels in this series before reading Holiday Wishes. I wish I could say it wouldnt matter if you didnt, but as I said above, the reason why it works is because we already have a relationship with Sean. We only needed to love him with Lottie, which was an easy thing to do.",1514764800,4
5280,567,1650,"The Chinooks Hockey Team is back! Yesssssss :)

I was so excited to see that there was going to be a new book to this series--I didn't even read the blurb before jumping at the chance to read it. When I started it and found out that the heroine was Lexie, John and Georgie's daughter from Simply Irresistible ? My excitement level doubled...and I am happy to report The Art of Running in Heels did not at all disappoint!

Sean and Lexie were cute together--I loved all of her lists and memos, and the fact that he actually read and remembered at least parts of them gets him some points as well. I also appreciated that the book wasn't one big sex scene after another, like so many contemporary romances--their first time wasn't on the night they met, and they went for a decent stretch of their fake relationship without sleeping together. I laughed out loud more than once while reading--Sean's attempted grand gesture was one of the times--and loved seeing John and Georgie again, twenty years later and still happily married. Fingers crossed that Ms. Gibson will be continuing the series. Surely Sean has plenty of single teammates? ;)

If you're new to the series, The Art of Running in Heels would work just fine as a standalone. There's more than a few references to John and Georgie's story--just enough to fill you in with what you need to know and tempt you to add it to your TBR before you're finished with this one.

5281,280,1654,"This is the first novel I've read by Cathy Maxwell. If this story is representative of her work, I intend to read more. I expected a romp. Ha! This was not that!

A rape, a murder and a coverup! The hero and heroine have a scandalous shared secret. Wow! I sat up and took notice. Maxwell has taken a subject matter that is usually cloaked in secrecy and shame and dumped it right out in the open forcing her characters and readers to deal with it.

Roman Gilchrist has inherited a title, a bankrupt, ramshackle estate along with debts of honor and no funds to satisfy them. His only option - a marriage of convenience with an heiress. The last thing he'd ever been raised to contemplate. His godfather presents him with several options. One young lady immediately captures his attention. They share a past and a devastating secret. If he must marry an heiress, then she is it, whether she likes it or not. She owes him after all.

Leonie wants to remain unmarried. She never wants to find herself at the mercy of a man. Her father has other ideas and goals. He has provided an immense dowry for the sole purpose of gaining a title for his progeny. She has no choice save obedience.

Leonie, as you will find fellow readers, is unlike any heroine I've encountered to date. She's real. She may have beautiful features and lovely ballroom manners, but underneath it all, Maxwell has created a woman who has experienced the ultimate horror and has coped with it in a manner that is oh so familiar.

Maxwell takes us on a journey here that creates empathy for this lovely couple and hope that they will continue to work together to make their home a happy one.

If you're looking for a romp, this is not it. If you're looking for a well-written and very nuanced story that challenges your preconceptions, you've come to the right place. I wonder what lies ahead for the next two spinster heiresses? I cannot wait!",1514764800,5

5283,1024,628,"I admit, I haven't read much Gaiman. The Graveyard Book and Good Omens are all Ive ever known of Gaimans work. And while I thoroughly enjoyed both books, I was never quite prone to picking up another one of his works. That has since changed.

American Gods has been on my reading list for a while and after getting annoyed with myself for not reading it sooner, a friend of mine put it on our book clubs reading list. I was so thankful to finally have a reason to crack this one open. Do you ever have a book that just feels good in your hands? Well, my copy of American Gods was exactly like that. I loved just flipping through the pages and feeling its weight.

That being said, this book was difficult for me to get through. Gaimans writing style is at its best. His proficient use in descriptions and alluring paragraphs does nothing but amplify the classic this book will become. However, I found the book exhausting to complete. Gaiman weaves in story after story that tell of the Gods of old. And while they do give a nice background to the characters involved, they mostly seem unnecessary and tiring. Gaiman did everything correctly in creating American Gods and his ultimate lesson in all of it is strong. But the ending left something to be desired. All in all, a decent read albeit long. I cant wait to see what they do with it in the TV remake.",1514764800,5
5284,1024,748,"Every now and then, I like to enjoy a romance novel. Usually I pick one of the historical ones simply because I like the setting as well as the chivalry that soaks every page. But this time, thanks to my book club, I picked up a rom-com that I probably wouldnt have chosen if left to my own devices.

The Hating Game by Sally Thorne was a whirlwind novel. Thrown into an office battlefield where two colleagues are trying to have the upperhand, Thorne introduces us to characters that are easy to love, or in this case, hate. Lucinda Hutton, assistant to one co-CEO of a publishing house, has dreamed of working for a publishing company since she was a young girl. Joshua Templeman, also assistant to another co-CEO of the same publishing house, disappointed his father years ago when he didn't follow in the family footsteps. Both clash desperately as they vie for a new position opening up, one in which they would be the boss of the other.

Thorne creates a wonderful hate-love relationship between these two characters that eventually culminates in a breath-taking ending. While there are some steamy scenes here and there, the comedy throughout prevents The Hating Game to become just another romance novel. I found it incredibly hard to put down and enjoyed the flirtation Thorne creates between the reader and the characters she has developed.",1514764800,4
5285,864,1371,"This book intrigued me from my initial read of the synopsis. It was a little delayed in getting to me but I was excited when it finally arrived. I opened it up to read and I knew from the first paragraph that I was going to love this book.

And I did.

Now, this is the type of book that one is either going to love or going to hate. I sincerely doubt there is going to be a middle ground. For me it was a bit of magical delight with a cast of characters that I enjoyed spending my time with. None of them was entirely likable and some of them were utterly unpleasant but taken all together I didn't want to leave them. This is what makes a book like life. People are full of contradictions and no one is completely perfect being.

Anthony Peardew is a man living rather half a life as he lost his love before they could be married. He collects lost things he finds on his daily walks about town. He keeps them in his office, well sorted and cataloged as to where and when they were found. Hes hired an assistant, Laura to help keep the house neat and do what needs doing but she is not aware of his..collection.

Anthony leaves the house and its contents to Laura after his death with the proviso that she try and return the lost things. But Laura is, truth be told, as lost as some of the items in the study. As she works with the gardener  for whom she has feelings  and the young neighbor Sunshine who has come to be her new friend, they find a way to start returning the lost things. But all is not quiet in the house as the spirit of Anthonys fiance needs one lost thing to be found.

This was a book full of happenstance and spirits. At the same time Anthony and Lauras story is unfolding another tale is happening almost simultaneously. They intersect at minute points but those intersections show how intertwined we all are.

Ms. Hogan has a magical way of writing. The only complaint American readers might have would be the British references. It wasn't problematic for me due to all of the reading that I do but someone unfamiliar with some of the words/phrases/products might find themselves at a bit of a loss. I was enchanted from the start as I noted. Its not always a happy tale but it is certainly one to engage the emotions. So I say sit down with the lovely cup of tea and settle in for a truly enjoyable read.

What a novel though! I was previously unfamiliar with Ann Patchett's work, but will be seeking more out as this really knocked me out. The construction, the plot, and the characters all work so harmoniously. Comparing it with something like Jonathan Franzen - this multi-decade profile of two broken families is far more engrossing in that the vast majority of the characters aren't horrible people or doing stupid things. You actually LIKE most of the characters as you see the reverberations of crucial life events of their collective pasts.

I also enjoyed how well the structure was used to examine family ""lore"" - how stories of the past - especially shared experiences - can be felt and thought-of and seen differently among various family members.

Nora, the daughter of the Earl of Stratton, has arranged the entire scenario so her father will be forced to see her wed to the man she loves, alas, her planned backfired and she was sent to New York to stay with her affable aunt and uncle, the Cortlands.

Nora is adamant to return to England post-haste. She devised a plan to find the most scandalous man in New York to agree into a fabricated betrothal with her.  Her father would not allow such scandal, she will be summoned home and she hopes she will be able to convince the earl to consent to her marrying Robert

Financier Julius Hatcher, utterly gorgeous, debauched, wealthy and ostentatious. High society is highly amused by his antics but deemed him unacceptable in their esteemed hallowed halls. Nora struck a bargain with the dissolute maths genius, he to pose as her betrothed and she to gain him access to high society functions he covets.

There's more to Julius Hatchard, that the gossip rags painted him to be. He's a self-made successful man in his business ventures. He's also desperate to find the men responsible for his father's business failure and demise. Nora provides him a means of entry to the high society where his prime suspects are. In return, he will assist Nora to be with her Mr Landon. Daring arrangement but they both think they could pull it off.

Joanna Shupe wrote another beautiful novel. Julius and Nora's slow-burn romance was fabulous. There were few stupefying moments. The secondary characters were remarkable. Julius and Nora's witty repartees were marvellous and their undeniable chemistry were palpable. If not for their audacious plans, they would not have realised they suit each other to a T. Ms Shupe made New York in 1890's dramatic and stimulating and put her indelible stamp in the forefront as the most credible Gilded Age romances author.

5296,778,1248,"Heart-Shaped Box sat on my Kindle, unread for far too long. Ive taken a bit of a shining to Joe Hills writing; he writes old school in a newfangled way. His books, the ones that I have read, are all a good length (no one hundred page novellas), complete standalones (there is no book 15 in the series) and definitely unique.

As I read Heart-Shaped Box one thing kept popping up in my head over and over again, onions. Now, stay with me here and let me explain. This book had layers, so many layers. Just as one part of Judas Coynes life was revealed, there was more of him revealed: his history, his hobbies, his little idiosyncrasies. Judas Coyne became, not just a character in a book, but a complete human being. Joe Hill not only brought his protagonist to life, but each and every single character. He took the time he needed to give his characters layers.

Beyond the characters, the story itself is layered with plots, subplots and comic relief that is so far down in the core that I have to give kudos to the planning and orchestration of the story.

In my humble opinion, if you love horror and you want to know the direction that its going, read Joe Hill. You won't be disappointed.",1514851200,5

5298,575,503,"I first read ""Outlander"" over ten years ago. Amazon will probably mark this review as ""not a verified purchase"" although I have purchased Outlander in hard cover, paperback, audio, and now the television DVD season series. Oh, and digital version for my kindle. I feel compelled to own Outlander in every version. The Outlander series has stood the test of time for me as my favorite series, my favorite author, the story that still gives me thrills no matter how many times I read it. Jamie is my book boyfriend and no other hero will ever take his place in my heart. Claire is a brave, smart role model for strong women and I admire her greatly. When I think of Outlander I think of the first three books grouped together, Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, and Voyager. For me it is all one story that just can not be broken up. No one can read to the end of Dragonfly in Amber and not rush to read Voyager, the story is that good.

Five stars is not enough. Over the years I have given plenty of books five stars. It is so wrong that I haven't written a review for Outlander before this - I never felt I could write a review for Outlander that would do it justice. If I did an honest comparison to other books, taking into account that my love for Outlander does not fade over time, then surely Outlander is twenty-five stars or more. You see, Outlander changed my life. Yes, it did. I won't bore you with the details but my life was changed after reading Outlander in a profound way.

I met Diana Gabaldon at a book signing in Traverse City, Michigan, when ""Written in My Own Heart's Blood"" was newly released and at the top of the New York Times best seller list. I was so nervous meeting her because to me she is bigger than a rock star. And she was so nice and personable, so very pretty. I think I stammered. I gave her a card and told her she changed my life. And the next day she tweeted to me. True story.

5304,674,51,"Despite what people may have heard or read this book doesnt encourage teenage suicide nor does it romanticise the idea of suicide. I cant speak for the popular Netflix series inspired by this book, simply because I haven't watched it.
Its important to bear in mind that teenage brains aren't fully developed until they reach a certain age in adulthood. Adults think with the prefrontal cortex, the rational part of the brain, which isn't fully developed until the age of 25. This is why a teen is more likely to make rash, illogical, dangerous and impulsive decisions. Everything is overly dramatic and every slight is the end of the world as we know it.
In the mind of  teenager every insult, imagined or real, is a reason to make a decision you cant just undo.
The reader meets Hannah after she has made the decision to end her life. After she has convinced herself that there is no other way out of her situation other than killing herself.
Ultimately in the midst of all the drama and overhyped teenage interactions Asher is trying to deliver an important message. When someone reaches the end of their tether, and leans towards jumping off the nearest cliff, they will send out subconscious signals. The signals are there for us to see, hear and read, we just need to acknowledge them. Instead of ignoring the changes in behaviour, appearance or the almost indiscernible cries for help, we need to open our eyes and try to help.
The story starts with Clay Jensen receiving a box full of tapes, a spoken testimonial from a dead girl. A girl he knew, a girl he kissed, and a young girl who somehow thinks he belongs on a list of people who pushed her towards suicide. He has to deal with the emotional upheaval caused by this unexpected accusation and the experiences Hannah has been through. Clay also has to deal with the fact he will eventually come face to face with the other people on the list. The people who ignored her, turned her away, ridiculed and assaulted her.
Suicide brings an element of desperation with it, but also one of selfishness. Suicidal thoughts are all encompassing, especially when depression is part and parcel of the equation. There is no room for thoughts of what those left behind will have to deal with. The why, the who and the fact they didn't see it coming and couldn't stop it. Even when there is light at the end of the tunnel Hannah is already so enveloped by her own darkness that she chooses self destructive behaviour instead of choosing a path other than death.
I could go on and on about this book. It isn't just a straightforward everyone was mean to Hannah and thats why she is dead scenario. Hannah isn't exempt from criticism. She makes mistakes and some dodgy choices, especially in regards to Jessica and Bryce.
Hopefully this read will make someone reconsider their actions and behaviour towards their fellow humans. Teens really need to take on board that actions have consequences, rumours ruin lives, bullying is destructive and suicide is a one-way ticket with no return.

5305,778,366,"Do you remember the first years of American Idol? When one of the contestants would give a particularly good, unique performance of a classic, Randy Jackson would say, You made it your own, dawg! Well, Dean Koontz certainly has made Frankenstein his own.

There is a certain wow factor that an author like Dean Koontz brings to his stories. He goes well beyond the basic storyline, with multilayered storylines, complex characters and well developed comic relief. It is with good reason that Koontz occupies so much space on the horror shelf of my local bookstore.

Prodigal Son has two storylines that are intertwined. Koontz has woven them together like a master. There is the arc of this book, and above and beyond that is that of the series as a whole. The two flow seamlessly together and it all makes perfect sense.

In my mind there are two sets of characters. Detectives OConnor and Maddison carry the story. They are well developed, interesting characters that I felt a connection to and want to know more about. But beyond them is Deucalion and his nemesis. These two are darker characters with secrets that only time can fully reveal.

Balancing everything are the comic elements; Koontz has chapters dedicated to banter between OConnor and Maddison over who should drive the car, and paragraphs about Cheez-Its. These are the factors that make a book more enjoyable.

I have found a new series that I want to continue and a classic that I feel I need to read. What more could a reader want from a book?",1514851200,5

5307,367,819,"The Woman In The Window is the first novel by American author, A.J.Finn. Doctor Anna Fox is a shut-in. Shes a child psychologist, shes thirty-eight years old, but shes also agoraphobic, and has not set foot outside in ten months. She lives alone; her husband, Ed and eight-year-old daughter, Olivia are in regular contact but away somewhere, for reasons that are only gradually revealed. A tenant in the basement maisonette looks after tasks like groceries and minor repairs, but keeps to himself otherwise. Her only other human interactions are weekly visits from her therapists (mental, physical). Oh, and theres Punch, the bad-tempered cat.

When not busy online (chess, French lessons, or consulting on Agora, a help forum for agoraphobics), Anna spends her days watching old black-and-white movies from her extensive DVD library, or documenting the lives of her near neighbours with her Nikon D5500 camera and its powerful Opteka zoom lens. She notes the arrival of the Russell family (dad, mom and lanky teenaged boy) as they move into the vacant house across the park. Young Ethan drops in a gift from his mom. Nice boy. And his mom, Jane comes to Annas assistance when some local teens vandalise her house. She likes them both immediately.

When Anna looks out one evening and sees Jane apparently stabbed and bleeding in the Russells parlor, she calls 911. But things go badly awry with her attempted rescue, and by the time her claims are investigated, there is no body and Anna is not believed. But she knows what she saw! Except that it is soon apparent that Annas eyewitness account may be less than reliable: shes depressed, on a bunch of medications and also drinking quite a lot more wine than she admits to her therapist. And many of those movies she immerses herself in are of the Hitchcock genre. Could she have imagined it all?

Finn fashions his tale with splendid skill. The clues are carefully dropped into the story, as are the red herrings. As some of the twists are revealed, they confirm niggling doubts the reader has formed about certain aspects, but this page-turner is so cleverly constructed that even the most astute reader is kept guessing right up to the heart-thumping climax. The characters are easily believable, and Annas doubt and confusion is well portrayed. This is a truly impressive debut novel, and it will be interesting to see what this talented author does next.

Unable to leave her house due to her phobia she spends her days spying on her neighbors and discovering their dark secrets. This book has been compared to The Girl on the Train. It is true that both books are similar but I found The Woman in the Window a lot more engrossing. The characters are more complex, the plot is more interesting and the pacing is better. I was never bored while reading The Woman in the Window, I was bored a lot while reading The Girl on the Train.

5310,778,819,"It looks like The Woman in the Window will be the last book that I read in 2017. What a fantastic way to end my year of reading. I always hate to compare a book to another, I feel obliged to make an exception in this case; The Woman in the Window is The Girl on the Train meets Rear Window. It would make an incredible movie, and yes, I will be dragging my wife there, although once she gets her hands on this book shell be there with bells on.

A.J. Finn has created a captivating character in Dr. Anna Fox. With all of the classic movie references, the contrast to Rear Window is inevitable. Unlike L.B. Jeff Jefferies, Anna Fox is trapped in her house due to a mental issue instead of a physical issue. Finn made the debilitating effects of Annas condition tangible, real and terrifying: Its swelling against the door, bulging its muscles, battering the wood; I hear its breath, its nostrils steaming, its teeth grinding. It will trample me; it will tear me; it will devour me. He has created a sympathetic character that the readers immediately feel for. We want Anna to get better and reconnect with her old life.

Finn had Anna lead me down the hallway, slowly revealing the cause of Annas condition. Then he pulled the carpet right out from under my feet, not once, but on several occasions. Thank you! That is exactly what I want from a story.

If you love a book that is patient and slowly reveals itself to you before smacking you across the face, The Woman in the Window will be a fabulous book for you.

Im a sucker for the fake relationship trope, so I was pretty excited for this one.

Lexie and Sean are okay characters. I wanted to like them both so much, but she comes across as flighty and hes really cocky {and not in a good way}. Seans inner monologue mainly alternated between thoughts of Lexies boobs and thinking about how there were several other women out there.

Plot wise, it was what I expected. There was a bit of drama, due to the reality show aspect, but my main complaint is that I just didn't see the relationship progress between Lexie and Sean. Sure, she tried a little, yet he only wanted to hook up. The chemistry was there, but I didn't see anything else.

Overall, it was a quick read with a lot of promise, but I just couldn't connect to the MCs enough.

This is a good winter season contemporary, but I only really connected with one half of the couple, so the entire story fell a bit flat for me. I love the meeting and sense of serendipitous adventure that Ammy and Noah find themselves in - even with the many snags, their journey is nice to see. And I did think the romance was sweet and fluffy, with a healthy dose of snarky and angst. Unfortunately, I wasn't the biggest fan of Ammy. I just didn't really connect with her, and our personalities didn't mesh well. Plus, I found her to be annoyingly indignant at times, and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

5326,134,1699,"But home isn't just a memory, Ive decided: its knowledge, knowing where you belong and where you fit in.

This was a solid sci-fi story that combined all the things I want to see in my science fiction reads: compelling research, characters I connect with, and an intriguing mystery. A Conspiracy of Stars follows aspiring scientist Octavia, whos desperate to follow in the steps of her parents and discover the secrets of Faloiv. But Octavia soon realises the planet isn't the only thing hiding secrets, and the ruling Council of NTerra might have a few of their own.

Thing I Liked
The cover is absolutely stunning and is on my list for covers of the year.

I thought it was really cool that all the research was animal-based. Learning how the animals interact with their surroundings and other animals, and using that to make advancements was cool.

I really appreciate that we get a large cast of diverse characters.  Octavia, her parents, Alma, Rondo, and Yaya are all black. And I loved that we get to see so many black scientists represented in the story.

Things I Didnt Like
I needed to know more about Faloiv and the Faloii people. I know a big part of this story is Octavia discovering the Council's secrets herself, but I felt a disconnect to what was happening because I largely had no clue how or why things were happening. I like the world building  of the legacy of the compounds and the Council, I just needed more from the other side.

This was such a quick read and I was so invested I didn't want to put the book down. Im definitely looking forward to getting some answers in book too, and I cant wait to pick it up.

5327,220,468,"Andy Weir writes about life on the moon with such authority and enthusiasm that the first lunar colonists will just have to use this book as a primer. (Unless hes just making everything up about how support systems and architecture and so on might be constructed, of course.) I mean, the guy has some sweet vision and creates the world of his story as fully and carefully as any of the most successful fantasy worlds. Really impressive work - so successful that it may go largely unnoticed by many readers unless they're looking for it. So look for it!
The plot in Artemis sizzles, too.

When you throw out things that no longer serve a purpose in your life this present moment, do it intensely and completely, once and for all. Do not spread it out over a long period of time. Give yourself 1-3 days to clear the whole house in one go. This makes all the difference.

The methods suggested for organizing clothes are very useful as well. Once you start folding them up, that is the only way to do it!

5331,436,1239,"Title: Hiddensee: A Tale of the Once and Future Nutcracker

Author: Gregory Maguire

Age Group: Adult

Genre: Fantasy/Historical Fiction

Series: Standalone

Star Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

Gregory Maguire won my heart back in college when I began his Wicked Years series; I caught sight of its green tinted pages and it was over after that. I have all but one book of the series sitting on my bookshelf to this day, and Ive never seen The Wizard of Oz the same way again. So, when I heard that he was writing a new book in October, this one revolving around The Nutcracker and his mysterious maker, Drosselmeier, I was so excited. One of my first field trips with my school as a child was to the ballet, and ever since then, Ive been utterly enchanted by the tale of The Nutcracker and Klara, the Sugar Plum Fairy, and the wintry land that they all inhabit, for however brief a time. Gregory Maguire spins a familiar tale with new, charming flair, complete with gorgeous writing, charming characters, elements of Greek mythology and Grimms fairy tales, as well as strong historical components. If Wicked weren't my favorite Gregory Maguire book, Hiddensee would have high chances of taking its place. What an enchanting, thought-provoking novel!

Once there was a boy in a cottage in the woods, whose parents were an old woman and an old man. Then one day, they gave him to the forest itself, perhaps hoping that he will die inside of it. But his life changes forever when two beings, a beautiful wise woman, and a cantankerous, angry dwarf that may or may not be able to conceal himself in a knife, imploring him to find a new place for them to rest. After a near-fatal encounter in the forest, the boy flees, traveling through the various cities in Bavaria. He drifts across the country, becoming a guardian for a well to do family, then he begins to travel across the continent, using toymaking to occupy his restless hands. He finally comes to a halt when he meets his best friends family, and comes to be known as the mysterious, almost cloistered old toymaker who lovingly watches over little Klara and gives her The Nutcracker he is so famous for crafting. Beautifully written, lovingly wrought, and finely executed, Hiddensee pairs two origin tales, painting a darker, more mythical creation story for a character I thought I knew: The Nutcracker and Drosselmeier!

I really, really liked this book! I was really excited for a new spin on one of my favorite stories that inspired one of my favorite ballets, and no one does fairy tale or classic retellings like Gregory Maguire. The prose was lovely, almost hypnotic, and I was absolutely spellbound; I also really loved the way that Maguire took elements from both fairy tales and history itself to tell the story of the boy who would go on to become the old, grizzled Drosselmeier; to be honest, before this book came out, it never even occurred to me to wonder where the toymaker came from, or how he came to be with Klara and her family. The pacing of the book took a little while to get going, but I was enchanted once it really started picking up. I loved following Dirks journey, and I loved the way that Greek mythology elements were peppered throughout the narrative. It all combined to create an intoxicating, beautiful origin story, and I loved the way that The Nutcracker itself helped steer the narrative. The characters were really relatable though there were a few that I didn't really care for. I loved the ending, though honestly it made me cry! The language and the stuttered pacing made it difficult to keep up with sometimes, hence the four star rating. Nonetheless, this new offering from a literary darling was exciting, finely wrought, tender, and thoughtfulI really enjoyed the food for thought that it gave me! The bottom line: Twinning origin stories for The Nutcracker and the man whom lovingly crafts him, Hiddensee: A Tale of the Once and Future Nutcracker was a beautiful, gorgeous and thoughtful fairy tale retelling that had me laughing, crying, and thinking deeplyI loved it! Another wonderful entry in Gregory Maguires repertoire! Next on deck: Stalking Jack The Ripper by Kerri Maniscalco!",1514851200,4

Hate to love + Sophie Jordan = something I had to read. Sadly I was pretty disappointed.

I really liked Piper and Hale. Shes strong and has a great work ethic and desperately wants to provide a safe life for her sister. Hale is loyal and has a lot of good intentions. Together there is chemistry, but there needed to be some actual conversation.

Plot wise is where I struggled. I didn't see the relationship between Piper and Hale progress to love, it just seemed like a whole lot of lust. And there was an entire thread of plot about Pipers brother (and Piper getting drugged with the intent to be raped) that felt clunky. I get the need for conflict, but it was rushed and underdeveloped.

Overall, it had something that kept me reading, but I wish there would have been more. I doubt Ill be reading any other books in the series.

5334,134,1697,"Fox, said Snake, curling slowly around her friends heart. Its time we face the truth.

This book was so fantastic and just absolutely perfect for a winter-y read. Theres this kinda desperate tone and  eerie calmness that just fits. Everless is a truly unique and captivating magical world where time is bound to blood and metal, and used as currency. Jules Ember is running from a mysterious past she doesnt understand, but she starts to seek answers as she returns to her childhood home to work as a servant in the Everless Manor, of the ruling Gerling family. Jules begins to uncovers secrets and faces more dangers than she could have ever expected.

Things I Liked
I just really loved the tone of this story. Theres a that  desperation is clearly established early on and creates a lot of tension and suspense throughout the story. There was also this overwhelming sense of dread that made me want to keep reading. I couldn't get enough.

This fantastic tone also setup quite a few surprises that I did not see coming, but they all really worked and felt natural in the story. The tone and the twists really kept me engaged.

I loved getting all of the worldbuilding about the history of the Sorceress and the Alchemist. I liked getting the different local legends from the servants, and getting more scholarly information from books and other characters. It was nice to see how different classes interpret and pass on the information. The magic system was another highpoint. Its so unique and creative - and I lived the inclusion of alchemy in the story.

Jules Ember was a strong main character and I really liked her. She gets to be mad, scared, vengeful, and hopeful. She really felt like a full character facing hard challenges and trying her best. I could also really feel her history at Everless. It gave her some nice backstory and set the tone for a few relationships.

Things I Didnt Like
I felt like some things in the story were a little muddled. There were really only two instances where I noticed it, but I did have to reread a few paragraphs and really focus.

This story was just so great and I loved getting back into fantasy. The characters, the relationships, the worldbuilding all captivated me and made me want to read. Everless is a fast-paced and thrilling story of secrets, truths, and power all wrapped in a desperate setting. I cannot wait for book 2!

  As she slowly gets to know Frank, Alice becomes consumed with finding out who Franks father is, how his gorgeous piano teacher and itinerant male role model Xander fits into the Banning family equationand whether Mimi will ever finish that book.

The blurb obviously grabbed my attention enough for me to buy the book. So why did I wait so long?

Whatever my reluctance, I was immediately captivated by the nine-year-old boy Frank. A brilliant child with a head full of random facts, he also seemed to capture the affection of Alice, the new assistant. His strange behavior and odd costumes did not endear him to other children, but some of the staff at school found him lovable and tried to protect him from the others. However, the principal who arrived at the school late in the book was so smug and off-putting that he set off a chain of disastrous events that would change everything.

I had issues with the inappropriate and unreliable Xander, who also had his likable characteristics. His tendency to pop in and out of Franks life made me very curious about how he came to be part of this dysfunctional group.

Alice, as our narrator, offered her own theories as she, too, questioned Xanders role. Was he a former lover of Mimis? Was he Franks father?

Mimi was self-absorbed, unreliable, and definitely unlikable most of the time. But then she would do something wonderful and make you question everything you thought you knew about her and her family.

Plot: The idea of time being currency is fascinating and I'm sure it's what caught many readers' eye, it's what caught my eye! The idea is genius and I loved the many layers that Holland presented. From the start, Jules was a bit more than met the eye, she had a close relationship with two young aristocratic boys but had to flee one night with the fear of being killed. I loved the many layers of this world and how it all related to Jules Ember, the servant girl. There came a point around the 70% mark where Jules started piecing strange happenings together and came to a realization quickly - it wasn't a natural process and disappointed me that Holland elected to resolve everything so hastily. The ending was fairly open-ended and has me curious about the sequel.

Characters: Jules intrigued me from the start, she was selfless and had a good head on her shoulders; however, as the book progressed, Jules became the Chosen One and I started losing interest in her. Luckily, there were other characters who seem to hold the keys to unraveling several mysteries of the world. It was the secondary characters that helped move the mystery and build the world, and I hope that they get the same growth opportunities as Jules had.

Worldbuilding: I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit shaky on how the time/blood coin/currency worked. Time was connected to blood that was turned into metal coins, and those coins could be digested to add more years; it was a very complex system. Besides that, I loved the world. There was a clear contrast between the aristocratic castle and slums of Crofton and I thought that Holland did a great job of defining the priorities for each class of people.

Short N Sweet: Everless was unique and full of mystery, I only wish that the ending didn't feel as rushed.",1514851200,4

5338,274,1697,"Everless, a debut fantasy novel by Sara Holland, is set in the kingdom of Sempera where time has been bound to blood and iron and its inhabitants must sell it to survive. Jules Ember and her father have been expelled from Everless, the estate owned by the powerful Gerling family and now live in poverty in the village of Crofton. When Jules suspects her father is dying, she must do whatever she can to buy him more time, even if it means returning to the home of the Gerlings whom she holds intense hatred for.

Jules is fiercely loyal and brave. She loves her father and is concerned for him as she soon discovers he is selling his blood iron to support them. She is willing to take enormous risks to save him and anyone else she cares about. Danger and intrigue await her at every turn, as not everyone she meets is who they appear or claim to be.

The story has a unique and unusual premise  a world where time is taken away or added to through the blood. There is a description of villagers waiting in line to have their time extracted from them which made me shudder, as being bled brings them closer to death. The rich live for centuries in opulence, while the poor, having to sell their time to survive, live in squalor and fear.

Everless is a compulsively readable, beautifully written novel with gorgeous imagery, lush settings and strong characters that kept me mesmerised. The details revealed of the history of the Semperans and their Queen are fascinating. I highly recommend this book and am anxiously awaiting the sequel!",1514851200,5
5339,407,1697,"In the kingdom of Sempera time is used as currency, bound to blood, and adhered to iron. When consumed it can extend life for those who imbibe. The Gerlings are a family of the aristocracy, and they tax the poor as much as possible forcing people to give their life force as payment, and in turn the Gerlings use it to extend their own lives. To say this causes a bit of resentment is an understatement.

No one feels that resentment more than Jules Ember. Ten years ago, an incident forced Jules and her father to flee from Everless, the Gerlings family estate. Now, Jules is forced to go back to keep her father from giving all his blood in order to make payments on their homestead. Jules knows that she left under questionable circumstances; she just hopes enough time has elapsed that no one remembers her. Jules returns on the heels of a visit to the estate by the Queen of Sempera, and with that visit comes warnings of things best left in the past. But now that the question is out there, Jules cant let the past lie.

Everless gets the honor of being a truly unique and unassuming book. I love books and love reading, naturally, so I think its fair to say that its easy to feel like youve read the same plot devices or storylines repeatedly. I had thought Everless would fulfill this same expectation, but by the end I realized how wrong I was. We all know the saying about those who assume right?

I loved the unexpected places that Everless takes Jules Ember, and by extension the reader, as Jules tries to acclimate what she remembers of her past with the new discoveries of the present, and what really happened that day ten years ago at Everless. Unfortunately, this was also a bit of the downfall while reading for me as well. Jules goes back to Everless with the need to earn more time for her ailing father. She doesnt go back with the intention to blow the doors open on long-held secrets, but thats exactly what ends up happening to her. This causes her to kind of stumble through the story a bit too much for me, she doesnt have a clear path leading her to answers, shes not specifically following clues, a lot of what she discovers, and how, is due to chance. Im hoping, however, with where things leave us, that this aspect will be different in the next book.

I loved, despite the book blurb, that the romantic aspect of the story wasn't as exaggerated up as I thought it would be. When Jules returns to Everless, she remembers her childhood friend, and Gerling, Roan with much affection, and she remembers his older brother Liam with much less affection. Who the brothers are, and who Jules remembers them as, is just another piece to the mysterious puzzle readers and Jules are tasked with figuring out. While we get a pretty good idea by the end, not everything is explicitly worked out for us, and I cant wait to find out more answers.

Everless starts the year on a good note. Its a twisting and often unpredictable mystery that, despite the precarious situation our characters find themselves in, leaves me eager to see what Sara Holland has up her sleeve next.",1514851200,4

I didn't read the blurb properly before I swan-dived in but anyway,

I see why people love it. The first person POV jarred on me a bit because I don't generally like first person POVs in romance, but after I got used to Nevada's voice the rest went smoothly. I spent my alternately laughing at and being scared of but 1/15 attracted to Mad Rogan, and I definitely look forward to seeing him bicker with Nevada like an old married couple. The Baylor family is a riot and I love them, and I even have a soft spot for Augustine.

5341,747,271,"I labored through 30% of this book and couldn't stomach gullibility and passivity of the 2 main protagonists. They had no foresight, no plan, IQ of an ameba and were being played by all evil characters. They had no game of their
 Own and it boring to read about clueless folks since there is so many of them around. Annoying and boring - could see the moves from the bad guys from a mile and couldn't believe the other folks were caught unprepared with their pants down. I cant believe all of the glowing reviews this book had.",1514851200,2
5342,902,819,"When a book is optioned to be a movie before its release you just know its going to be good and Im so pleased to say that this is worth all of the hype and I can absolutely understand why Ive been seeing it everywhere. There is something very cinematic about the way this is written, it really is begging to be a movie and Ill be anxiously awaiting its eventual release.

The best psychological thrillers keep you guessing and there is much back and forth here. Anna is a woman on the brink, shes unraveling at the seams but she isn't your standard, is she reliable or isn't she narrator. I was fascinated by the insight into Annas mind and loved not knowing exactly what she would do next, that sense of unease is a must for me in a psychological thriller. Not only is she incredibly well drawn the entire book is multifaceted and well accomplished, you can tell that Finn knows exactly what hes doing and every element of the plot has a purpose, a reasoning behind it and I was blown away several times while reading this.

This starts off slower but the pacing gradually increases throughout the book all the way up until a breathless, tense ending. There was something menacing about the style of this book, an unnerving feeling that made me anxious but also totally engaged. Its on the longer side, especially in my experience of a thriller, but at no point did it feel drawn out or just too much. You know how sometimes it seems like authors are trying to hard, whether its with crazy, unbelievable plot twists or overdone writing that drags on? There was not a hint of that here and the fact that this is a debut is all the more impressive, Ill be following Finns career closely.",1514851200,5
5343,282,1697,"Sara Holland's Everless was one of my most anticipated releases of 2018. Not only was the cover exquisite but also the premise sounded unique and fresh. Time as currency? I was definitely intrigued. As the praise and rave reviews began pouring in, the larger the hype grew and the more excited I became. Thankfully, Everless was everything I had hoped it would be, and much, much more. Everless is intoxicating as well as spellbinding. It was so incredibly easy to lose myself within its pages - ten more minutes would become an hour and an hour would quickly become several and before I knew it I was at the end.

World building can make or break a fantasy, in my opinion, and thankfully, it made the book in this case. Sara Holland has created such a lush world within the pages of Everless. It was incredibly easy to picture the kingdom of Sempera, and I also enjoyed the detail she put into the Gerlings and their aristocracy as well as the alchemist and sorceress. Actually, the story of alchemist and the sorceress was one of my favorite parts of the book, and I especially enjoyed the way in which Sara Holland presented it through whispers and long passed down stories. It added a questioning, suspenseful edge to the novel- Were the stories correct? How much was fact and how much was fiction? Were there hidden clues to be found within?

Additionally, I found the characters to be well developed and likable. Jules is a woman on a mission, and nothing - not even the cunning, tricky Gerlings - can get in her way. Jules is headstrong, determined, and dauntless. She'd do anything to save her family, especially when it comes to the father she loves so dearly. Over the course of the book, Jules deals with a fair amount of change - scenery, family dynamic, friends, etc; however, never once did Jules falter in the sight of the unknown. She embraced it, and I appreciated that about her. It was fun to see her on her journey and it was even better to see her pull in wins. In addition to Jules, I also liked her father. He was incredibly caring, the type of person who'd give his last shirt up to keep someone else warm. Seeing him and in turn seeing his relationship with Jules made it crystal clear why Jules would risk everything for him. He was her world and she was his. I also enjoyed the power players encountered in the castle. The queen was twisty and chilling. The princess was reckless and easy to trust as well as love. The two princes were like day and night. Roan was warm and welcoming while Liam was foreboding and staunch. While Roan should have been the easy favorite, Liam was the one I was drawn to. He had a twisty, dark past, but I had a sneaky suspicion there was more good to him than met the eye.

The plot of Everless best described in one word? Thrilling! Once the story got going and the adventure and thrills started churning out in rapid speed, I was one hundred percent hooked. I loved the court drama, the sabotage that kept peeking up, the bad that came with the Queen's arrival, and the feeling that something incredibly sinister was at play. I read this book way faster than I would've liked, but I couldn't help it. I also appreciated that while there's romance, it isn't a huge part of the book. There's a slight touch here and there, which ended up being plenty. Additionally, I liked that the romance wasn't what I had expected - the ending of the novel truly managed to surprise me!

In all, Sara Holland's Everless is a stellar debut. Blending together romance, suspense, and royal intrigue, Everless will most likely end up on many Best of 2018 lists and rightfully so.",1514851200,5
5344,646,1700,"The Handmaids Tale is an apt comparison for An Excess Male, a dystopic sci-fi novel that extrapolates the results of Chinas One Child Policy.

An Excess Male centers around one family and Wei-guo, an excess male who hopes to join that family. In the future imagined by King, China has turned to polyandry to deal with their skewed sex ratios. Legally, a marriage is allowed to have one wife and up to three husbands. Wei-guo, a forty-something bachelor dreams of having a family, but even entering a marriage as a third husband, his chances at marriage are still slim. But hope is in sight: the family of May-Ling, an attractive young woman with two husbands, is interested in taking him on. But the family has secrets of their own, secrets that could destroy their household if ever revealed

I initially thought that, given the premise of the book, women would have more power and equality. Turns out thats not true. The future imagined by An Excess Male is just as patriarchal as our present. Women are placed on a pedestal. They might be more valuable objects, but they're still objectified and denied equality. In the society of An Excess Male, women are confined to the home and the roles of wives and mothers. In fact, having multiple husbands makes their lives worse, if anything, as their marriage contracts stipulate that a wife owes each of her husbands a child and outlines bedroom schedules shes obliged to follow. See why I said The Handmaids Tale comparison was appropriate?

Its the elite, married men who have the power, especially those wealthy enough that they have a wife all to themselves. Its sort of like the people already in power find ways to keep their power and keep their bigotries in place, no matter how illogical it may be. For instance, in An Excess Male, gay men are basically second-class citizens. They have to register with the government as a Willfully Sterile and are then surgically sterilized. Despite that, even registered gay men are at risk of getting swept up by the police, and those who aren't registered can have their entire lives destroyed if discovered, being prevented from ever seeing or speaking to their children again.

In addition to being super sexist and homophobic, the society of An Excess Male is also super ableist. Like gay men, the neuroatypical are at risk of forced sterilization and, in their case, forcible commitment to an institution. The government deems all neuroatypical men Lost Boys and calls them a plight upon society, one they are determined to root out.

Thus the problems of the family our story centers around. Wei-guo is an excess male, which the government sees as practically disposable. May-Ling is terribly unsuited to the role of a housewife and primary caregiver for her rambunctious toddler. Her first husband, Hanh, is a closeted gay man who keeps his sexuality a secret because of how much he wants a child. If discovered, their family unit will be dissolved and he will never see his son again. XX, Hanhs brother and May-Lings second husband, is most likely somewhere on the autistic spectrum, and he also would face dire consequences for failing to pass.

The narrative of the book alternates perspectives between the four characters. Interestingly, Wei-guo and May-Lings chapters are in first person while Hanh and XXs are in third. I don't know why the decision was made, but it worked out well enough. I enjoyed all of the characters chapters, and I never found myself wanting to skip one to reach another. An Excess Male is mostly a family drama, centered around these four people and their lives under a dystopic, authoritarian regime, although some other elements come in to play during the second half. From the very first chapter I was hooked and had trouble putting An Excess Male down. I ended up reading all of it in under twenty-four hours.

Forewarning, theres some problematic/ambiguous consent stuff in An Excess Male, although I did get the feeling that the narrative was aware it was problematic. Again, Handmaids Tale comparison. May-Ling is sixteen when her family basically sells her in marriage to Hanh and XX, who are both substantially older (in their 50s or 60s, I think). If you're thinking, yikes, I am too. Theres a lot of really uncomfortable sex scenes in this book. May-Ling knows Hanh is gay, but she continues to make sexual advances, and sometimes hes too tired to fend them off. Also, XX doesnt want to be married at all, but hes basically stuck with the situation since divorce is extremely difficult and would cause all kinds of exposure to the family.

Probably my biggest issues with An Excess Male relate to how it handles queer issues. In short, not very well. The notions of sexuality presented are very binary  gay or straight. At one point in the story (when May-Ling is saying she and XX could divorce, she could then marry a straight man and Hanh a gay one), it would have made a ton or sense for it to acknowledge bi or pan people exist, but alas. Even if the society in the book thinks of sexuality as binary, I expect a novel dealing with these themes to recognize greater complexity. For a story with a major subplot about homophobia, it just doesnt make any sense to only mention gay men as existing. Does the government similarly recognize lesbians? Theyre never mentioned. My guess is that they aren't recognized the same way and are forced to get married, because thats what benefits the straight men who rule everything. The final straw for this book doesnt handle queer issues well is the ending Hanh receives relative to the straight characters in the book. I won't get into spoilers, but I was raising my eyebrow.

I would have liked more female characters as well (Im not sure this book passes the Bechdel Test), but I can see why they were absent, since that is the basic premise of the novel. I still would have liked to see more relationships between women, but I guess that would be a whole different book. Maybe King will write another story set in the same world? I think theres plenty of room for it, and Id love to read it.

An Excess Male is a very complex story, dealing with issues of sexism, homophobia, and ableism. I think it actually works as a literary fiction/science fiction cross-over that could appeal to other groups. Although judging by other reviews, theres some conflicts there. Some readers found it too genre while others found it too literary. Although I don't think it handled the issue of homophobia super well, An Excess Male is still worth reading. Its a story Id recommend (maybe with a few caveats attached), and Id love to see it get more attention from the sci-fi community.",1514851200,4

5346,652,819,"Separated from her husband and daughter, agoraphobic, psychiatrist, neighbor watcher, photo taker.

Anna Fox was all of those, but mostly agoraphobic. Anna hadnt left her home for ten months and even rented her basement to a young man who could do errands for her so she wouldn't have to leave the house.

To pass the time, Anna would sleep, drink wine, take her meds that were not to be taken with alcohol, spy on the neighbors, wonder what they did, and pray that no one ever saw her looking at them through her camera lens.  You do have to feel sorry for her because agoraphobia is a crippling disease.

Anna saw things she shouldnt see and heard things she shouldnt hear, but she said it isn't any of my business so she left it.  One night, though, she saw something she shouldnt have seen and reported it to the police anyway.

THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW dragged on talking about Annas days and her chats with people on the computer about their shared disease.

The dragging immediately ceased and the tension immediately mounted when Anna saw her neighbor get stabbed, when she called 911, when no one believed her, when she started to investigate, and when she became more paranoid when out-of-the-ordinary things started happening to her.

THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW kept my interest, but it wasn't edge-of-your-seat or gripping until the last half of the book. The ending had enough gripping action to make up for the slow start.

I think the oddity of Anna and her situation kept things going in the first half of the book along with the wondering about the reason for the separation from her family.

All in all, if you can get past the beginning, you are in for a marvelous psychological thriller and lots of surprises. 4/5

This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and Edelweiss in return for an honest review.",1514851200,4
5347,625,819,"5++ stars

The Woman in the Window is a phenomenal read - while 2018 has just begun I can safely say it will be one of my favorite books of the year.  There are so many unpredictable twists and turns, and I do not want to include any spoilers, so I will mention very little about the plot.  However, I will state that the pacing is absolutely perfect, the characters fabulously written, and the ending simply outstanding.  The book is perfect - The Woman in the Window is the best psychological thriller that I have read in years.  The book is written in small chapters, and as I reached the end of each one I kept saying to myself just one more.  I ended up staying up until 1 a.m. to finish the book (less than 10 hours after I started it).

My favorite parts of the book were the pacing, the fabulous writing, and the ending.  As I have mentioned in countless reviews, this genre tends to frustrate me more often than not because I find that the story is super predictable, the ending is ridiculous or the characters are so frustrating and make such poor decisions that I want to throttle them.  Thankfully, none of that occurs here; a few times I puzzled out small details as they developed but usually close in time to the unveiling of that particular surprise.  More often than not, I was amazed at the direction the story was taking.  As the book progressed, I started worrying that the ending was going to be a letdown because the buildup was so fabulous, and I just couldn't puzzle out the solution to the mystery.  Thankfully, Finn crafted a superb and realistic ending that made the book a 5++ star read.

I highly, highly recommend The Woman in the Window.  If you don't read another psychological thriller all year, read this one and block out time to read it because once you start it you will not be able to put it down.  I am already looking forward to the movie even though it is still in early developmental stages, and I hope Finn is working on his next novel.  I received this book to read and review; all opinions are my own.",1514851200,5
5348,69,819,"The central character of A. J. Finn's novel, ""The Woman in the Window,"" is thirty-eight year old Anna Fox, who narrates her story in a series of brief chapters.  Fox is a former child psychologist who, after a traumatic event left her emotionally crippled, became agoraphobic.  Her once attractive skin is now a mass of ""dimples, stipples, stubble, and wrinkles."" She pays a psychiatrist, Dr. Fielding, and a physical therapist, Bina, to tend to her at home, but even with their assistance, Anna has made limited progress.  Dr. Fielding has convinced her to take a few steps into her rear garden, but when panic ensues, as it always does, she retreats to the safety of her four walls. She drinks wine to excess, takes pills prescribed by Fielding that are delivered to her door, has a tenuous grasp on reality, and regularly scrutinizes her neighbors with a Nikon camera that has a powerful lens. She admits, ""My mind is a swamp, deep and brackish, the true and the false mixing and mingling."" In addition, she uses the Internet to glean more information about the men and women whose privacy she invades.

Anna is no saint, but she is smart, funny, and when sober, remarkably self-aware. She plays online chess skillfully, studies French with her tutor via Skype, and counsels fellow agoraphobics who log onto an Internet discussion board. What she needs, but does not yet have, is the courage to face down her powerful demons. One day, while keeping an eye on her neighbors through her closed window (""Here I am, utterly, literally locked indoors locked, windows shut, while I shy and shrink from the light""), Anna is shocked to witness a murder (shades of Jimmy Stewart). She dutifully reports the crime, but no one believes her.  In fact, the local detective, Conrad Little, believes that she is an unstable attention-seeker. The murder, if it did occur, took place in the home of Anna's new neighbors, Alistair Russell, his wife Jane, and their sixteen-year-old son, Ethan.  .

Finn's prose is bitingly satirical, colorful, and frequently hilarious. Anna is obsessive movie-watcher (she loves old black and white films), and selects the DVD ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (Jimmy Stewart again) to enjoy one night. She subsequently puns at her own expense: ""I am the woman who viewed too much."" The plot thickens when she strikes up a friendship with the aforementioned Ethan, who hints that he is afraid of his father.  ""The Woman in the Window"" moves along briskly, but falters when Finn throws in an over-the-top and wildly melodramatic conclusion. Belatedly, Anna realizes that she may pay a high price for her flawed judgment and unwarranted assumptions. This homage to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" may not be perfect, but Finn's suspenseful, entertaining, and compelling page-turner is destined to become a big bestseller.",1514851200,5
5349,844,819,"From the publisher:  Anna Fox lives alone - - a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her days drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.  Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son.  The perfect family.  But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldnt, her world begins to crumble - - and its shocking secrets are laid bare. What is real?  What is imagined?  Who is in danger?  Who is in control?  In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one - - and nothing - - is what it seems.  Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving.

Before I begin my review, I must state that every one of those adjectives is absolutely accurate.
The novel spans a period of less than two months, with the first chapter beginning on Sunday, October 24th, and the penultimate chapter on Monday, November 15th, with each chapter (sometimes only a single page) describing events within that single day, the final chapter taking place six weeks thereafter, or just about at the end of the year.  There is a lot that happens in that relatively short time.

Anna lives alone  her husband has left her, taking their teenage daughter with him.  Anna  or Dr. Fox, as she prefers to be called - is agoraphobic, somewhat ironic, as many of her patients in her private practice suffer from the same malady.  She herself sees a therapist on a weekly basis, whose visits are conducted at her home.  So her ventures outside of the front door are minimal, to say the least.  Which works out well, as she can barely open the front door at all, except to admit visitors, such as her physical therapist/yoga instructor and her therapist.

Her doctor has added some powerful psychotropics to her meds, warning her that she must not take them with alcohol, a warning which Anna ignores, to say the least, if anything increasing her use of alcohol, resulting in hangovers that are nearly disabling.  (Her consumption of Merlot, e.g., becomes prodigious.)  But when Annas constant voyeurism when it comes to her neighbors suddenly reaches a near crisis, and the woman in the window of the title describes not only Anna, but also the woman whose house is across the way, when Anna sees things that are, to say the least, very disturbing.

This novel was hard to tear myself away from, the poetic writing almost hypnotic.  This is a book that stays with the reader long after the final page has been finished.

5351,282,1701,"Jennifer Castle won me over with her debut novel The Beginning of After way back when. So when the chance arose to read and review her latest YA, Together At Midnight, I jumped at the opportunity. The cover was gorgeous, the storyline sounded interesting, and it took place during the holiday season - the week between Christmas and New Years to be exact. Simply put, I couldn't wait to dive in! Thankfully, Together at Midnight is another must read by Jennifer .

When Max and Kendall witness a terrible, tragic accident, they're at a loss. They don't know how to move on from such a quick yet monumental moment, and to make matters worse: they feel as if they could have prevented it. Thus begins their random acts of kindness across New York City, and from that moment starts an incredible journey  one that changes Max and Kendalls lives for the better.

When it comes down to it Kendall and Max are in an incredibly similar place: they're at a crossroads in life, not sure of what to do next. Kendall has recently returned from a semester abroad, and she's feeling incredibly unsure in her skin. How she can she return to normalcy after being so happy with her adventures? Max, on the other hand, has chosen to put off college for a year. On the surface, he says he did it for his ex-girlfriend - she needed him around - but deep down he knows he did because he's afraid, afraid of the future and what it might meant for him.

I loved them both equally. They were so incredibly easy to relate to it. I admired Kendall for his kindness as well as loyalty. She's the kind of person you'd be lucky to have as a friend. What I loved even more was the fact that Kendall was her own person. She didn't always do or say the right thing - sometimes she would stop randomly to write something important for her future novel down - but she so completely embraced it. She was more fearless than she gave herself credit for. Max, on the other hand, I feel was the more cynical out of the two, and I think most of it had to do with being afraid. I could relate to that - change is scary, especially when you're in that weird time between high school and college.

Together Max and Kendall were a dynamic duo. I loved watching them explore New York City together and perform random acts of kindness. Better yet, I loved the changes that resulted from their adventures. Both became more confident and daring as well as helped each other find comfort in the unknown.

Another aspect of Together at Midnight I enjoyed was the multiple POVs used. Jennifer included perspectives from Max, Kendall, and all the people they helped or tried to help on their journey. All the POVs flew perfectly together, and I especially loved seeing the viewpoints of the strangers. It added such a personal touch to the novel, and I especially liked when it gave more clarification to a situation, i.e. why wouldn't that woman accept help?

I also enjoyed the slow-burn feel of the romance. When the novel begins, Kendall has been flirting via email with a guy she previously knew and Max is somewhat still tied up with his ex-girlfriend. Over the course of the book, however, Kendall and Max begin to see something in each other, something that begins to change their feelings towards their other relationships. Honestly, at times I really wondered if they would or wouldn't, but in the end, I was so incredibly happy with the conclusion.

In all, Together at Midnight is another stellar release from Jennifer Castle. I said this when I first finished this book and it still rings true: my heart is so incredibly full from this novel. Seriously, it's beautifully written, thought provoking, and hopefully...it's actually inspired me to start my own random acts of kindness in 2018.",1514851200,5
5352,277,819,"The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn is a psychological thriller.  The story focuses on our heroine, Anna Fox, who lives alone in a 5 story house in a nice neighborhood.  Anna suffers from agoraphobia, and has not left her house in 10 months.  What is agoraphobia?  It is the fear of being outside, with panic attacks if they leave the house. Anna spends her days drinking wine;  watching her neighbors through a camera;  goes to various internet chat sites to talk to other people with their own problems (she is a psychologist, though she cant help herself); watches old movies, and talks to her husband and daughter on the phone daily.

One day, one of those neighbors, saw Anna through the window and came to visit her.  The neighbor, Jane Russell, just moved in, and Anna was able to enjoy the conversation.  A second visit also introduced her to the womans son, Ethan.  A few days later, Anna heard a scream, and when she looked through her camera, she sees Jane pressing her hand to her bloodied chest and falling.  Anna calls the police, and even tries to leave the house to help Jane.  The detectives come to interview her, as there is no body, and the family, including the wife, are all there healthy.  They question her sanity, especially since she drinks a lot,mixing it with her pills.  What did Anna see? Was it real or was she having hallucinations?

I do not want to give any spoilers, as in any psychological thrillers, and The Woman in the Window is no different, there are many surprising twists and turns.  What follows is an intense and exciting storyline that follows Anna, as she continues to try to find the truth, even if she thinks maybe they are right and she is seeing things.  I will say that the story in the first half of the book was a bit slow, as we got to meet the main characters, as well as learn more about Anna.  The second half of the book was very good, that I was unable to put the book down,  especially with a couple of shocking revelations that I did not see coming and threw me for a loop. Though she was severely mentally challenged with her phobia, I wasn't totally crazy about Anna early on, even if she seemed very normal chatting and helping others on the internet; but later on I did like her better, especially after learning more secrets.

The Woman in the Window was a tense dark thriller that other than the slow start, it was very well written by A.J. Finn.  I do recommend you to read this book, especially if you enjoy psychological thrillers.",1514851200,4
5353,847,1493,"What is it about?

First of all, I had no idea until just a few minutes ago that Sir Terry Pratchett passed away in 2015. In 2009 he was knighted by the Queen. I guess she liked his stories, too.

This collection of short stories was published in 2016, but most of these stories were written (according to other reviewers) in the 60's and 70's and remain largely unaltered (according to the publisher/narrator).

The stories have a bit of variety of them. Some of them are about crime in a small 2 bicycle town. Some of them involve some form of time travel, or time unraveling in a way that takes you back a few generations. Others involve gnomes or people of even smaller stature. They are all interesting in subject matter.

Was it good?

I've read and listened to a lot of the Discworld books, and now I have certain expectations of Pratchett's writing and style. Since these stories were written before Discworld, I don't think they quite lived up to his literary reputation. The subject matter is interesting, but they just aren't as funny as Pratchett usually is.

The narrator has pretty smooth and deep voice and I found myself thinking several times that I would love to be tucked into bed right now and just close my eyes and listen until I fall asleep.",1514851200,3
5354,608,496,"He travels through the countryside reading the news, collecting ten-cents a head to those who gather and listen to it.  The year is 1870 and on one of his stops, he is asked to take a 10-year-old white girl to her relatives, as they feel he would have better luck seeing her to her destination, as he too is white.  During this 400-mile journey, as the distance becomes shorter, their relationship deepens.

Captain Kidd had the girl stripped and cleaned up before he left town with her.  Joanna had been living with the Kiowa Indians for the past four years after they had captured her, and now free from that lifestyle, she needs to make some lifestyle changes and she has some learning to do.  Captain bought a wagon to make traveling easier and after he loaded up their gear, they were gone.  Captain tried to teach Johanna various skills and techniques that he thought she should know and she was a quick learner.  Johanna taught the Captain a few skills that she had learned from the Indians as she was growing up and the Captain soon realized that she wasn't as helpless as he thought.  Soon Johanna was jumping in to help before Captain had to ask.  Needing money, they would spend the night in a town where the Captain could do one of his readings.  The Captain would find someone to sit with Joanna as he wasn't sure if she would stay while he was gone.  The Captain would try to find an adult to supervise her which didn't always work out.  Many times, he would have to hunt her down as these adults were not always competent enough to watch her.  Captain had a job to do but he soon began to wonder if all this hassle was worth it.

I found myself drawn into the relationship of these two.  Johanna is still attached to her Indian lifestyle and she wants to go back to them. She is used to the outdoors, the countryside and natures way of doing thing.  Captain thinks of Joannas future: living under a roof, cooking on a stove, wearing dresses and being a proper lady and he doesnt know how she will manage these changes or if she will.  I liked how Captain was determined only to read what he thought was proper during his readings. He did not want fights or arguments to occur them and he stood up to others when they questioned him about what he read.

When I read the synopsis of this novel, I was skeptical whether this novel would be something I would enjoy.  This novel surprised me as once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  Im glad the book club choose this novel as it is something I would have never picked up on my own.",1514937600,4
5355,419,1697,"I really enjoyed EVERLESS. I found it to be imaginative, compelling, and enjoyable. The characters were interesting and the storyline was spellbinding.

EVERLESS was original and I think that was what drew me in the most. Jules character was well rounded and developed. I had no issues falling into the rhythms of her story and rooting for her to get all she was seeking.

I was surprised many times during the book. From the situations to the bad guys, things happened when I least expected. Although I thought I knew things about characters, I was proved wrong multiple times.

I loved the world. It was hard to imagine when I started reading, but the author did a fantastic job of bringing it to life. I did find a few things a little confusing, but I still very much enjoyed it.

EVERLESS took me by surprise. It was more than I thought it would be and I was left wanting more. I'm sad I have to wait a year to find out what happens next, but EVERMORE is already on my wishlist.

5356,277,1697,"Everless by Sara Holland is her debut novel, and I am happy to say it was slam bang of a beginning.  Everless is a fantasy novel, with a different world building that I have never encountered before.  It is a world where time is currency, and people can pay from their life time (years) in blood for money.  In the kingdom of Sempera, the rich Gerlings and the Queen have the most time, which allows them to live indefinitely.  Their servants are paid through coins of life, and any punishment is loss of time through bleed outs.

Jules Ember, our heroine, used to live in Everless with her father years before.  10 years later, with her father close to dying, Jules is forced to return to Everless as a servant to help her father.  She has not forgotten her friendship with her childhood crush on Roan Gerling, the now Prince, as well as his brother, Liam, whom she hates for having driven her father from Everless.

Once Jules begins to work on the estate, where she will meet new friends, and discover many secrets.  Jules will come face to face with both Roan, who is betrothed to the future Queen; and  Liam, who recognizes Jules right away, and despite his attempts to make her leave Everless, and stay away from those above her, she continues to try and find out the truth about her childhood past.  Jules has always had nightmares, and also hides that she is able to stop time for a short period; something which she has no idea why, but knows she needs to keep this a secret.

Jules was an amazing heroine, and as she learns more and more about herself and her magic, she becomes stronger, but also finds her life in danger.  Rather than tell too much more would become spoilers.  There are so many twists and turns, with a few surprises that were totally unexpected. Who could Jules really trust? Who was real and who was the evil betrayer?  I have to say towards the end, I was a bit shocked as we raced to the finish, and had me breathless with each mind blowing reveal.

Everless is an exciting & different fantasy story line, which had a great heroine, and some excellent secondary characters.  Sara Holland has done a fantastic job writing this story, especially being her first novel.  I am not a fan of cliffhangers, but this one was a doozy.  Well done, Sara Holland, for your super start in what I imagine will be a great career.",1514937600,5
5357,1029,833,"It is a truth universally known that a book that requires the reader to immediately go request the rest of the series from the library must be rated 5 stars.

I'm pretty sure Colbie is my spirit animal (except my mom and brother aren't awful, thanks very much). I love that she's a YA author (and come on, what book blogger doesn't love a good book about a writer who is passionate about her writing?) and that she can laugh at herself. Colbie and Spence both have a self-deprecating sense of humor that I really like, and the development of their relationship was fun to read. There is a part with Spence's female friends taking Colbie to girls' night that make me cry for her, but I won't say more than that because I don't want to spoil it. Suffice it to say that Chasing Christmas Even made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me smile like a total goofball hard enough that my husband asked me what on earth I was reading that put that doofy look on my face!

Chasing Christmas Eve is the 4th book in the Heartbreaker Bay series. I didn't know that going into reading this book, but it became obvious partway through by the sheer number of supporting characters in Spence's life. I even correctly guess that it was the 4th book, based on the information that was tossed out that of Spence's Tribe there are three couples. (Take that, Sherlock!) While this is the 4th in a series, it can absolutely be read at a stand alone. There might be some minor spoilers for the earlier books, but nothing you wouldn't already know from reading the back cover blurbs. It was a little confusing trying to keep all of the side characters straight, so I pretty much just let it go and stopped caring who Elle was in relation to Archer in relation to Joe (though as I type this, I think I actually DO know that relationships, so yay?) and just focused on the main storyline and the fact that Spence has a lot of friends who care about him. I did go request books 1 and 3 from my local library to read them as well, so I suppose if I'm wrong I'll update my review to warn you of any spoilers. :) I have read the second book in the series (The Trouble With Mistletoe) and it was every bit as enjoyable as this book. :)",1514937600,5
5358,121,1697,"Reminiscent of the movie In Time, in the world of Everless, time is, literally, currency. And much like In Time, the system works to keep the poor poorer and with short lifespans while the rich can live for centuries. Only this is fantasy and the time is in their blood, which means a bloody business to sell and make money for yourself. (Youd think its only about replenishing blood, but the magic ties to your lifeline  you can only see how many years you have left to live)

Jules, our main character, has to go work for Everless estate to save her father from death. Being back there after a decade (when she and her father were chased off) means she is stepping back into a world she hates, but the thought of her childhood friend Roan consoles her. However, soon the Queen visits the estate and Jules gets caught up in their business  and her plan to get vengeance on the estate have a significant role in the ladder she climbs. Jules is a bit naive and sometimes I really wanted to shake her. She goes into a plan half-prepared and only her ability flaring up to protect her saves her skin most of the time. On a plot standpoint, she is trying to uncover a mystery and that mystery has a slightly Gothic feel to it  theres this manor and there is a lot of secrecy involved and a vault that is not to be entered.

Time and an age-old story play a part in directing the actions around Jules. The story of the Alchemist and the Sorceress gives most of the details and connects all the weird events in the book, but there are some things which are still left unexplained, like the source of the magic (apparently even hedge witches can wield time) and Jules ability to alter the flow of time. Also, first the Alchemist is designated as male in the stories but the names of the Alchemist are all female-sounding? Also, why do the young nobles consume blood iron if they don't need it (assuming they already know how much time they have in their veins). And more importantly, I don't think weve explored the possibilities of a world where you literally know how much time you have left?!

So, on a plot level, the story is good. But the world building needs more work  it wasn't until like the last quarter than the economy of blood iron even made sense. And I still don't get why they had to start to use that as currency, though, if they already had a system in place (presumably) prior to it. As for characters, I think it couldve been better in explaining the ties between the female characters? Ina feels important in the start and then she is practically out of the picture. As for romance, well, it has little to no romance element. She is interested in Roan but well, he is not the right person for her. Liam felt like another character I want to shake  dude, like how about NOT being so emo and moody? A little communication wouldve done both him and Jules some good.

Overall, its an interesting story, and Im interested in how the events of the epilogue work out. It was certainly entertaining, but also a bit predictable. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the sequel.

Lots of humor, fighting and sexual tension in this book. I have to be honest, about half way in the book for some strange reason I pictured Bernadette from the Big Bang theory in the episode where they are at a conference and she met up with her very tall ex-boyfriend.  After that I couldn't shake the thought so the sexy scenes were not so sexy for me. I did enjoy the book though and would recommend to everyone who loves a little contemporary romance in their life.",1514937600,4
5362,1029,309,"Let me first lead by saying I read a LOT of historical romance set in the Georgian/Regency era. Let me then follow that with - holy anachronisms, Batman!! (The most painful: ""Hey there, my foxy lady."")

This is definitely YA/NA by the tone. unread plenty of adult Regency romance featuring 18 year old leads and the immaturity of Henry ""Monty"" Montague is much more like an 18 year old in this day and age than one in the 1700s.

I wanted to slap Monty several times, and he's very much one of those people who manage to take two steps forward then one step back. He's got a major case of the poor-pitiful-me's as a titled, white non-cis man in the 1700s. Meanwhile his best friend is half-black and an orphan beinf raised by his English aunt and uncle in a soceity thay is very unwlecoming to people of color, and his sister is a scientifically minded woman interested in medicine in an age when women aren't allowed an education and are technically owned by their fathers and then their husbands. So yeah, Monty, things are tough all over. But then I also hurt for him and wanted to see him have a happy ending.

Though I had to throw this book to the side several times and read something ELSE for a while, it did grow on me (rather like a fungus). And darling Monty did manage to have some personal growth so I suppose I felt slightly less like slapping him by the end of the book. I look forward to learning more about Felicity and her adventures in the next book - now there is a strong woman!!",1514937600,3

5364,1030,51,"Where to begin...?

I wanted to like this. I have a high interest/sympathy in and for mental illness and things of that nature so this story intrigued me at first. I started reading, and then as it went on I found myself skimming, and finally skipping to the end to see how it all turned out. I don't know all of the ""13 reasons"" Hannah killed herself, I only read a few. I don't understand why this book has been turned into a TV series or why it has such a high positive rating. It doesn't deserve either.

Honestly I think this could have been a good story. Maybe even an eye opening one. But this author ended up sending a terrible message to kids struggling with depression/bullying IMO. The reason being is that the main character, the one who kills herself, is not in the least a likable person. It is hard to feel sympathy for her. And that's because these tapes that she leaves behind - which she basically blackmails the recipients into listening to and passing on - seem to be for more than just ""so everyone knows."" The contents of the tapes don't only tell them why she died. They will also destroy the lives of those she's selected. Including the life of the boy who WANTED to be her friend. (Maybe not destroy his life, in a sense, but it certainly does mess it up) So what does this tell kids contemplating suicide? That you can kill yourself and use a letter, a diary, a series of social media posts or self-made videos to get revenge after you're gone? What kind of example is that?

The next thing I had a problem with is the way Hannah expected all of these people to know what she was struggling with, and how bad she was hurting, when she apparently never told them. She pushed people - including the boy who wanted to help her - away. Then at the end of her tapes claims: ""You all cared, just not enough."" That is extremely unfair. Her parents loved her. Clay (the boy) loved her. And yet she didn't give them a chance to ""care"" when she really needed it. Again, what is this going to tell kids? That they will never get help and no one will understand them and caring from others only goes so far, so the only option is to die?

Thirdly, Hannah witnesses a drunken assault and does.....nothing. (That is one of her reasons for dying, but even still) And, at the end of her tapes, tells us that she allowed one of the boys at school to assault her so she had one more reason to push herself off the deep end, towards suicide. And then went to the school councilor as the final test. To see if he would really do something to help. This is just not acceptable on any level.

Now maybe people could take all of this and say it can be used to show some kind of lesson, like how sometimes when we hurt our expectations of other people are not always realistic, or that we need to realize just because someone seems ok doesn't mean they actually are. But the above issues stood out far too much for me to read the entire book to try to find much eye opening positivity. It all seems like this could harm young people more than help, and the idea of it now being a TV show makes me cringe. The only thing I will say in it's favor is that this entire thing begins with a rumor. One tiny rumor that spreads like wildfire and becomes something else, and that does show everyone needs to keep their mouth shut if they don't have all the facts and if they are incapable of saying anything nice. But it is probably the only good lesson or example to be taken from this tale.",1514937600,1

5366,567,1648,"I really liked the first book in the series, A Most Unlikely Duke and was looking forward to the sisters'--Amelia and Juliette's--stories. The Duke of Her Desire, Amelia's book, was readable, but it just didn't quite have the zing that Raphe's story did.

I liked the older brother's best friend element of the story, and Amelia's feeling like a fish out of water made her easy to identify with. It felt believable that Amelia would fall for Thomas first, and that he'd take a little bit more effort to bring around. Their chemistry was decent, but not off-the-charts amazing. I did like that once again Ms. Barnes had the two wait to finally sleep together--a refreshing change!

The suspense part of the plot, tied to the charitable endeavor Amelia is working on, felt a bit tacked on at times--and wasn't really resolved entirely satisfactorily in the end. I suspect that individual might play a part in Juliette's book, maybe? Overall, I liked this book, but didn't love it--you can still sign me up for book three, though ( The Illegitimate Duke ) because I do want to see what's in store for the youngest sibling.

Having just read of the Halifax Explosion that rendered 20,000 homeless in an instant martial law was declared as a precaution and sailors petrolled but there was virtually no looting. If youve been to London as I have youve witnessed the phenomenon of queuing--Londoners do it with no word or any form of organization imposed. The principle of common decency, lets get it done calmly pervades.

Such is the story of over 400,000 men trapped between the German troops and the beach at Dunkirk when the call went out and a flotilla of over 600 private boats crossed the channel despite U-boats, German gunboats, mines, and dangerous waters and shoals plus the Luftwaffe to bring the boys home. The sheer audacity of the enterprise stretches belief. Well might Churchill have feared a reverse invasion by Hitlers troops.

The miracle is that it actually happened. In the panic to destroy everything left behind that would give comfort to the enemy paper supplies were burned leaving commanders nothing upon which to write their orders. Typical of the snafus was a garbled message was delivered the anti-aircraft battery that seemed to order their evacuation. With the port and the beaches being bombed and strafed by the Luftwaffe the men spiked their guns before they left.

The book drags on with interminable detail. Moving 10,000 men when there are half a million chased by the German Army doesnt seem much of an accomplishment. Time and again the swamping of small craft by panicked men eager to escape comes up. The writer obviously had access to many diaries and journals as moving men was more important than record keeping. Military training is all too effective. Without someone to give direction troops quickly become a mob. To restore order one need not be an officer, only look and act the part.

The miracle is that for nine days the normally choppy Channel remained millpond calm, Hitler made inexplicable decisions, and a few good men made it happen.",1514937600,4

Popularized by films like The Conjuring, the truth of what they do is much more terrifying than any fiction.  Eds encyclopedic knowledge of demonology and Lorraines clairvoyance make them a force to be reckoned regarding any paranormal activity.  They offer a few specific case examples theyve encountered over the years, but they are somewhat reticent to provide too many details in fear of glorifying the negative forces that they encounter.  They also cite the difference between the ghosts of former humans and the inhuman and diabolical spirits (aka demons, aka fallen angels) that are the true threat to individuals.  Outlining the different phases of infestation, oppression, and possession (sometimes redundant), they emphasize that many people passively conjure these spirits with Ouiji boards, and others do so actively with conjuring or black rituals. Most importantly, negativity in general attracts these otherworldly spirits to manifest themselves.  Though this edition is a reissue and covers the Warrens activity during their heyday in the 70s (some aspects are a bit dated), the overall theme is timeless and downright freaky.",1514937600,4

5373,429,925,"Last Christmas in Paris by writing duo Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb was a novel I stumbled across during a bookstore outing and was just drawn to instantly. I hadnt read anything by either of these authors before, but I was thrilled with how much I enjoyed my time with Paris.

Consisting entirely of letters and telegrams, this story depicts life in areas of England, France, and other areas of Europe during World War I. While it is described as an epic romance, I found that to be secondary to the larger plot. Evie and Thomas have been friends since they were quite young and now that Thomas and Evies brother, Will jade left for the front, she can do nothing but pray for them and keep writing. The inseparable trio thought their time apart would be brief and theyd all be together again by Christmas, but they were sorely wrong.

Weeks turn into days that turn into months and then years. Letters among Thomas, Evie, and some of their friends and family fly throughout the pages sharing with us, the audience, their hopes, dreams, and fears for what lies ahead during such difficult and trying times.

Without giving too much away, all I can say is that this book is an emotional rollercoaster. I felt like I was one of the gang reading such personal correspondence and feeling their good times and bad coursing through me as if I were hearing from close friends. Their sadness as well as their triumphs felt like my own.

If youve followed this blog a bit, you know how rare it is that I actually shed tears when Im reading. In the last five years, I think theres three books that have left me wiping my face as I left the characters behind. Last Christmas in Paris was one of those books for me. What can I say? Years spent with Thomas and Evie and their heartfelt lines to one another throughout such a bleak period in World History left me more than a little emotional.

The holidays may be escaping us, but this is still a solid read any time of year, or if youd rather wait to cozy up with this one on a snow day or Christmas 2018, do that too. Itll leave your heart full of complex feelings. Itll give you the sparkly tingles of the yuletide season, the magic and allure of Paris, the sadness of distance and battle, and the fulfillment of love that transcends all the obstacles.",1514937600,5

Someone recently asked me my favorite books and I realized the Bronze Horseman was in my top five, which is saying something because I am a very avid reader. I realized I must leave a review.

To other reviewers who said this book starts slow, I say this: Be patient. This is an epic romance. The story builds and builds until you're on the edge of your seat. I'm quite sure I bit off some fingernails while I was reading it. I know I lost some sleep. I couldn't stop turning the pages, reading all night and all day, completely enthralled. This is a great love story, and yes, it is long, and I love that it is long. It isn't formula romance, it is life and death situations, struggling to survive in times of great historic proportions, a hero who is truly a hero in every sense of the word, a very young heroine who grows and becomes of woman of great courage and strength.

I think there should be a special rating on Amazon for books of this caliber. Five stars does not do it justice. This book stands out as one of the greats that endures the tests of time.",1514937600,5

5379,398,1107,"Servant is the 7th entry in Silvas popular spy thriller series about Israeli intelligence uber-agent and art restoration expert Gabriel Allon, numbering 17 novels to date, appearing annually. This one, about a Egypt-based Muslim terrorist group, was published in 2007  and assuming its discussion of the Muslim penetration into Europe is accurate (likely, given all the citations provided) paints a troublesome view of the future in such notable countries as Holland and Britain, setting for most of the tale.

The plot centers around a terrorist attack on Britains subway stops, a murderous diversion to facilitate the capture of the US Ambassadors adult daughter. Allon learns advanced knowledge of the caper but fails to convince British Intelligence of the real threat, but almost personally stops the kidnapping in progress. The rest of the plot centers on her possible rescue and inevitable ransom situation.

Several reviewers complain about the perceived, and possibly tiresome, superiority of the Israeli involvement and Allons personal role in most of the action. Hey  its a spy thriller, not a documentary, although this reader was disturbed by much of the information about terrorist infiltration throughout the old countries. That said, the novel was for sure a suspenseful page-turner, virtually exactly what we expect from Silvas word processor! {3.5}",1514937600,3
5380,542,1705,"I'm rounding up almost one star.

This book blends two genres, only one of which its title and blurb suggest. It does a good job of it, but I was a bit taken aback to encounter the second.

The first three lines will go into my (mental) collection of good openings:

""When I learned of Aunt Dimity's death, I was stunned. Not because she was dead, but because I had never known she'd been alive.

""Maybe I should explain.""

I enjoyed all the characters, especially Aunt Dimity and the role she played in the narrator's childhood. As for the paranormal manifestations in the book, they seem rather sweeping in their scope and effectiveness, but I'm no expert either in paranormal fiction or in alleged paranormal manifestations.

The plot chugged along reasonably well, and the resolution, while not necessarily brilliant, wasn't unsatisfying or a cheat.

I'm moving on to the next book. (BTW, the first two Aunt Dimity Mysteries are collected in the paperback I'm actually reading, Introducing Aunt Dimity, Paranormal Detective: The First Two Books in the Beloved Series.)",1514937600,5

Thomas More wrote Utopia originally in Latin back in 1516, and in it he reveals some both very interesting and puzzling ideas on what the ideal society would look like. I can't say I agree with everything he said, but every aspect of the Utopian society is well elaborated and shows exactly how things would work for the inhabitants of Utopia. The beginning ofUtopia reads a bit slow, but as soon as the story starts elaborating the different aspects of Utopian life the pace picks up considerably.

5389,286,14,"Why do people act the way they do? It's a question that has been debated by societies for what we can only assume is basically the entirety of human existence. Astrology has been used to try to explain it, as has the balances of humors in the blood. In modern times, there's an entire scientific field that studies human behavior and what causes it. Psychology, though, tends to focus on the bigger, more 40,000 foot view of why people behave in particular ways. It doesn't answer, for example, why crack dealers often live with their mothers. In Freakonomics, economist Steven D. Levitt (with co-writer Stephen J. Dubner) attempt to answer that and various other questions about human quirks. Some of these are relatively light-hearted (tracking how baby names move down through social classes over time), and some have much more serious implications (tying Roe v. Wade/more widespread access to abortion with decreasing crime rates).

Levitt and Dubner put all their faith into a field usually called behavioral economics. It posits that humans are rational actors, and when they appear not to be, it's because the incentives that drive their choices aren't obvious. How much you go along with their theories depends on how much stock you put into behavioral economics, and for me, it's honestly a mixed bag. The most interesting portion of the book, in my eyes, was the chapter on abortion and crime. It's more of a purely statistical dive, and the underlying assumption that he uses, that women are good judges of when they shouldn't bring children into the world because they won't be able to devote sufficient resources (money, of course, but time and energy too) to their raising, is one that makes sense to me. The children that might otherwise have been brought into the kind of poor home environments that correlate with (but don't necessarily cause) criminality simply weren't born and therefore can't be in the world, committing crimes. It's a bold hypothesis, and unsurprisingly turned out to be one of the most controversial. Since I had the revised/expanded edition of the book, they actually included an appendix chapter doing a deep dive into their statistical analysis. I've got some very basic grounding in statistics, but it was beyond my ability to actually comprehend, so I just have to trust that they did their homework correctly.

There are some other interesting tidbits, including one about charter/magnet schools and their effect on student achievement, but I found myself often skeptical of their breezy assurance of their own correctness and faith in their data. After the massive statistical analysis failure of the 2016 election, it's more obvious than ever that data isn't always all-knowing...it needs careful parsing and tweaking to accurately reflect reality.",1514937600,3

5391,186,1707,"Terry Pratchett has written a classic tale of heroes on a quest to save the world. Just kidding! Its Terry Pratchett and Discworld and there is nothing traditional about any of it. The pace is mad cap, the language is full of puns, the heroes are unlikely, the settings and sidekicks are even more unlikely, and the fun is nonstop. It should be impossible to write such pure nonsense that ends up making great sense. Once again, Terry Pratchett demonstrates how he is the master of a fantasy sub-genre that probably belongs to him alone. Clever, witty, rapid-fire. The Discworld novels fall into different categories: Tiffany Aching, Rincewind, the three witches, Sam Vines and the guards, and Death.  This book is a novel of Rincewind. Each book focuses on one of them, although they cross over and pop up in each others' books all the time.  It is best if you start from the beginning of a grouping and work your way through, otherwise you'll miss a lot of inside jokes, references, etc. There are charts on the internet that will show you the groupings. Having said that, I read Wee Free Men first, and it made me a fan. You can trust Terry Pratchett to not be too linear and to not be very predictable. Terry Pratchett does a wonderful job of maintaining the integrity of his absurd world and his characters while keeping everything fresh and creative. The humor is wrapped around serious themes. The characters have fantasy aspects, but they illustrate many universal truths of human nature. I cannot read too many of them in a row, but when I need something different, a Discworld novel is the perfect metaphorical palate refresher.  Life on Discworld is threatened and extraordinary efforts by an eccentric unmatched team is required to restore balance. Rincewind is an extraordinarily inept wizard whose greatest talent is saving his own skin. He is assisted by the traveler Twoflower, the Luggage, Cohen the Barbarian, Bethan the Sacrificial Virgin, and others along the way.  Like all the Discworld books, the tone is satirical and clever. This book did not make me laugh aloud as frequently as Wee Free Men, but it had its moments. Had to love the throw-away line about the luters! These books do not contain any scenes, language, or images that would rate even a PG-13 rating at the movies. If a reader does not have sufficient maturity, much of the book will be wasted, because you won't get the jokes or understand the satire. I count myself lucky to still have so many novels of Discworld ahead of me.",1514937600,5

5404,117,1186,"Im a huge fan of F.S. Fitzgerald and having just re-read this first novel of his that has brought him success and recognition, I certainly know why. His language is pure magic, which breathes metaphors, allegories and the most inconceivable expressions that simply take your breath away, making the most ordinary events into something truly outstanding and magnificent. Sometimes I felt like I had to slow down my reading just to enjoy the melodic flow of the narration, and in my personal opinion, any novel that makes you feel in such a way fully deserves the right to be called timeless.
The subject of rapidly changing life and the disillusionment of the protagonist in his own generation and its values and views is delivered superbly, just like Amorys character development, who grows and gradually transforms in front of the readers eyes from a careless and even shallow egotist (as Fitzgerald himself calls him) into a thinker and even somewhat of a disillusioned philosopher who searches for the meaning of life and completely reevaluates his own in the very end of the novel. That uncertainty in which hes left, that somewhat of an open ending is an excellent tool in delivering the idea that maybe nothing is lost yet for this new generation, and that maybe with more young men like Amory it will find itself and reinvent itself once again, abandoning its old, traditional and rotten materialistic form.
A truly magnificent literary work that everyone needs to read at least once in their life. Highly, highly recommended.",1515024000,5

5407,122,819,"The Woman in the Window is a psychological thriller.

The narrator is Dr. Anna Fox (she is in her late 30s, story told in first person POV).

Anna has been unable to leave her home for the last 10 months. She is a child psychologist who now suffers from agoraphobia.

Since she cannot leave her home she spends her time on the internet, watching black & white films, and playing chess. However her most interesting pastime is spying on her neighbors.

The spying part of the story is what interested me the most. I was completely obsessed with the idea of Anna watching her neighbors.

Anna lives alone, although she has a tenant (David) who lives in the basement of her house. Her husband Ed and daughter Olivia have moved out. Anna has a therapist, Dr Fielding who visits her home every week. And she has a physical therapist, Bina, who does the same.

Anna is touted as being an unreliable narrator. She drinks a lot of wine and takes a lot of pills for her issues. But I actually did not find her unreliable and believed everything she said.

The book is about a new family, the Russells, that move into the house across the park (father Alistair, mother Jane and teen son Ethan). Anna sort of becomes obsessed with this family and something that she saw.

There were definitely a lot of questions that were only answered as the story progressed.

I loved the beginning of this book so much. I absolutely loved the idea of Anna spying on her neighbors. But I was hoping that would be the main focus of the story. The beginning gave me the impression that Anna would be more of a snoop. And I was a bit disappointed that the author ended up only focusing on the Russells.

I think that this book is 4 stars for me. It had so much potential. It was a good book and I enjoyed it. But I feel like it could have been so much better. I did find the reveals to be surprising and interesting. And I liked learning about Anna's story. But I just wanted more of the story that I thought it was going to be (with her spying on all of her neighbors).",1515024000,4

5409,923,819,"I read that this novel had purportedly set a record for a debut novel that was pursued by numerous production companies for a film treatment.  Fox films (now Disney) won that race and THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW will hopefully be adapted into an above-average thriller.

As for the novel, it had some unique elements but borrowed heavily on Hitchcock films.  The cool thing is the lead character, agoraphobe Anna Fox, is obsessed with old thrillers and there are many references to Hitchcock classics like ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", ""Rope"" and ""Rear Window"".

Anna has a dark secret which is revealed slowly throughout the novel but one that I picked up on almost immediately.  Regardless of that, we get to watch Anna as a total shut-in residing in the newly gentrified part of Harlem, NYC.  She lives vicariously through a fantasy world she creates for the people and neighbors she watches from her window.  When a new family moves in across the way she invests time and energy in learning all she can about them.  She witnesses (imagines?) a resident of that new household being brutally murdered.  The problem is the police find no evidence and the new neighbors claim Anna to be a menace.

The rest of the novel reads like a page-turning thriller should with some surprises and many characters to suspect of no good.  The final act was a bit of a letdown for me but THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, overall, sets the tone for 2018 as a year I hope will provide many new and old thriller writers coming up with something original to seek my literary teeth into.",1515024000,4
5410,122,1701,"Together at Midnight is a standalone YA contemporary novel. This is my first book by this author.

I loved that this book was set in New York City. I loved that this book was set around the holidays. It made this the perfect book to read right now.

This book has a bunch of 1st person narrators. But the main two narrators are Kendall and Max. Kendall (17/18) is a senior in high school. And Max (18) has just graduated high school.

Kendall has just returned home from a few months in Europe. Max has decided to take a year off before going to university. They happen to witness a tragic accident that shakes them up. This leads them to wanting to perform random acts of kindness.

This book takes place over a week (from December 26th-January 2nd).

There is some romance in this story. But it isn't the key element. Although there is a bit of a love quadrangle.

I really liked this book. But I was not expecting the story to be told the way it was. There were many narrators. Normally I do not really like the idea of too many narrators. But in this case it worked. And it was so different. The extra narrators were people that they helped. These were interesting perspectives. Because when you do something nice for a stranger, you never really know what their circumstances might be.

Kendall was an interesting girl. She has ADHD. She is constantly writing in her notebook and making up histories for people she sees.

Max was interesting as well. I really liked his grandfather and that whole storyline.

My only real issue would be with the ending. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure that it was satisfying to me. But overall this was a really moving and wonderful story. I loved the idea of the random acts of kindness. It made it the perfect story to read around the holidays.",1515024000,4

5412,142,1709,"Initial Thoughts

After reading (and really liking) P.S. I Like You by Kasie West, a lot of people recommended The Fill-In Boyfriend, claiming it was West's best book. I went into this book expecting a fun, light, fuzzy read that would leave me feeling good.

In reality, there was a lot about this book that really annoyed me. I ended up really not enjoying it at all.

What I Liked

The synopsis. It was really interesting, and I have never read or heard about a book that is very similar.

The plot. Again, it was very original, and if I ignore all of the stuff that really annoyed me, this book was actually pretty great. I loved the plot and how the book ended.

The romance. It was cute. What can I say, I'm a sucker for cute romance.

What I Didn't Like

JULES. AND THE REST OF GIA'S FRIENDS. I cannot tell you how middle-school-drama their whole relationship felt. It was quite frankly just ridiculous. It was so forced, and it was literally ""my friends brought in a new girl to the friend group who thinks I'm the leader and now hates me for some unknown reason and wants to turn my friends against me."" GAHHHHHHH. And going off of that...

How immature all of the characters were. I have this problem with a lot of YA contemporaries, but it was particularly bad in this one. The characters literally acted like they were 12 half of the time, and they were supposed to be seniors in high school.

How the parents were portrayed. Gia's parents were very one-dimensional and frustrating. I understand what West was going for with their characters, but they didn't come off as human at all. They were more like forced stereotypes. Also ""fill-in Bradley's"" (not gonna spoil his name!) mom was the ""artsy-mom"" stereotype and that annoyed me to no end as well. Also fill-in Bradley's dad? Did I miss something? Because I don't think he is mentioned at all.

All of the side characters... no, all of the characters. They were so one-dimensional it actually hurt. And don't even get me started on Gia. She made me want to scream half of the time.

Overall

I can't say I hated this book, but it was pretty bad. But bad more in the ""stop being so moronic and act your age"" way rather than ""this book is literal trash"" way.

I'm going to give The Fill-In Boyfriend 2 out of 5 hearts.",1515024000,2
5413,455,819,"In A.J. Finn's spine-tingling debut psychological thriller The Women in The Window, Anna Fox sits in the window of her Harlem townhouse watching her neighbors. We learn that she is an agoraphobic and hasn't left her home in ten months. Her husband Ed and eight-year-old daughter Olivia no longer live with her after an incident that has been hinted at, but Anna remains in contact with them.

She rents out the basement of her home to David, a young man who helps around the house in exchange for reduced rent, and Anna gets her groceries delivered by Fresh Direct, and her many medications delivered by the pharmacy. As long as they keep bringing her meds and cases of Merlot, Anna can make it through the day (usually drunk).

She plays chess online (and usually wins) and dispenses advice on an agoraphobic message board. For entertainment, Anna watches old black and white movies, heavy on the Hitchcock thrillers.

Anna has little physical contact with the outside world until the day a new family moves into the neighborhood- a husband, wife and teenage son. Anna can see inside their home and becomes fascinated by them, even more so when the son and mother stop by separately to see her.

Like Jimmy Stewart in Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", Anna witnesses something amiss at the new neighbors and is drawn into a situation she is unequipped to handle.

The Woman in the Window is a pulse-pounding, heart-stopper of a book. Like blockbusters Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, our protagonist is unreliable. Anna is drunk much of the time, and so what she tells the reader cannot be trusted. The addition of her agoraphobia heightens the tension of the story, and Finn does such a great job making the reader feel the anxiety of her illness.

Finn also unspools important information about Anna a little bit at a time, so that reading The Woman in the Window is like putting together pieces of a puzzle. We learn how Anna got to be where she is, and although the reader may guess a few of the mysteries, the last few chapters of this fast-paced story surprised me, and at one point I actually gasped aloud.

The Woman in the Window is sure to be a bestseller, and fans of both Alfred Hitchcock movies and Agatha Christie novels will be love it.  I liked it better than Gone Girl and The Girl On The Train. I heard all about this book last spring at the Book Expo, and you'll be hearing a lot about it in 2018. It definitely lives up to the hype, and I read it in one sitting, unwilling to put it down.",1515024000,5
5414,275,819,"The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn is a compulsively readable novel that is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcocks brilliant classic, Rear Window.

Dr. Anna Fox is a child psychologist who has been unable to leave her house due to severe agoraphobia.  She whiles away her days drinking copious amounts of wine, popping a cocktail of prescription drugs and spying on her neighbors in between watching old movies and indulging in a variety of activities on the web. When a new family moves in across from her, she is quite intrigued by the  Russell family, whom she gleans as much info about as possible from on line research.  With little in person interaction with the outside world other than her physical therapist Bina, clinical therapist Dr. Fielding and her tenant David, Anna is surprised but delighted when sixteen year old Ethan Russell pays her a visit. She is even more thrilled when his mom, Jane, spends a fun afternoon with her. However, Anna is a bit alarmed when Alistair Russell stops by and asks a few vaguely threatening  and rather demanding questions about her recent visitors. Anna continues spying on her neighbors and after she witnesses something incredibly shocking, will anyone believe her rather outlandish story?

Anna has not always suffered from agoraphobia.  At one time, she was happily married and raising daughter Olivia with her beloved husband Ed while also working in a thriving practice with another psychologist. Despite her intense interest in what is happening inside her neighbors homes, Anna leads a solitary existence where she self-medicates with alcohol and escapes real life by immersing herself in black and white movies.

After her encounters with the Russell family, Anna is even more fascinated by her new neighbors. She is somewhat concerned about Ethan who reveals a few details about himself that are vaguely worrisome. Her afternoon with Jane is the most fun Anna has experienced in a long time and Jane confides just enough information about Alistair that raises a few concerns about the state of her marriage. She continues to watch the Russells from the security of her home and once she is convinced something horrible has occurred, Anna contacts the police with an alarming tale. However, once they know the truth about Annas past, will they believe her?

The Woman in the Window is an engrossing mystery that will initially keep readers glued to the pages as they try to find out why Annas life has completely unraveled. A.J. Finns clever twists and turns keep the tension high as Anna tries to figure out whether or not she can trust herself. A series of misdirects and clever red herrings throw readers off track as the novel thunders to an exciting, twist-filled conclusion.

Humor in one sentence leads to poignancy in the next, and on to wisdom in the following paragraph. The mundane becomes meaningful when reflected upon by a good writer with great skill, and that describes Perry to a tee. Philosophy is a worthy pursuit and in this effort it is carried out close to the ground and not in the clouds. Readers looking for a chance to smile, nod and reflect will find plenty of reasons to do each of those while reading this book.

If you have discovered these books, you're fortunate, and if you havent, you can still jump in. Heres the first in a series of swashbuckling tales of a British captain on a fighting warship in olden times, starring the characters Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, a kind of Napoleanic-era Kirk and Spock (and I ruined the movie version for a friend with that comparison). Except that Captain Jack is even less self-aware and more prone to jump into suicidal situations than Captain Kirk, while Stephen is a doctor and sometime secret agent as well as a world class scientist. The book details their exploits, and the author is a meticulous researcher, giving us a complete flavor of the times and the details of everyday life.

5439,828,1715,"Tom Ryan was the one-man publisher of an op-ed small-town journal, If you consider 17,000 people small. This book is a self-indulgent memoir with a lengthy prologue in which we learn the author is youngest of nine children of equally self-absorbed parents. Via the grapevine he learns that an aging miniature schnauzer is headed for euthanasia if he doesnt acquire a new home. Despite living in a no-pets apartment he takes on the dog. Its not so much that he now owns a dog as the dog has moved in as his assistant reporter. The pair bond instantly as canine and partner become a news gathering team.

When his instant side-kick needs to be put down 18 months later Tom goes on an immediate search to find a new team member and lands upon an equally eccentric dog breeder who pairs him with an independent-minded schnauzer puppy. If you know the breed youll understand the quirkiness. You don't so much own a Schnauzer as take on a relationship. This book is the story of the accommodation the pair arrive at, the ongoing relationship the author has with the breeder as she aids in allowing the dog to train his owner, and the transformations that take place in the life of the human half of this team.

5444,973,1716,"After being a little disappointed with The Wide Window, the third book in A Series of Unfortunate Events, I am pleased that The Miserable Mill by Lemony Snicket picked up the pace! The plot of this book revolves around our favorite Baudelaire orphans being sent to live at a wood mill, where they're expected to serve as employees, despite obviously being children, to earn their keep. Their caretaker intends for them to work there until Violet, the eldest, turns 18 and inherits her family's fortune and will have enough wealth to take care of herself and her siblings. Klaus gets mucked around the most in this novel, as there's a major plot line regarding his glasses being broken and repaired several times. This book features a bit more physical/emotional/verbal abuse than either books 2 or 3 because the primary caretaker in this book does not care for the Baudelaire orphans at all, so there are no pleasant moments like those that sometimes occurred with Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine.

These are the perfect books to pick up when I feel like I'm in a reading rut -- there's so quick and familiar that they can add a little fun to my reading routine if it's been lacking. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the fifth book, The Austere Academy, at a resale shop quite yet, so I'll have to put off counting on this series to be my reading pick me up until I can get my hands on a good condition version of the book that matches the style of my other books in this collection.

And here is my favorite quote from Book the Fourth:

""As Im sure you know, whenever there is a mirror around, it is almost impossible not to take a look at yourself. Even though we all know what we look like, we all like just to look at our reflections, if only to see how were doing. (p. 45)",1515110400,4

This book though reminds me so much of my own journey through my teen years and the trepidation from the idea of starting my adult life away from the safety of home. Being ""there"" with Laura as she reached and triumphed over life's speed bumps, gave me the courage to face my own. It's why I think all young people should read these books.",1515110400,5

It's clear that these characters' paths will intersect (or in some cases already have), and Wonder Valley weaves between their separate yet connected storylines.

Stories like this can be so hit or miss, and Wonder Valley falls into the latter category. It tries so hard to be smart and layered and profound, but it never transcends its own shallow banality.

Pochoda's prose is fine, yet it often feels manufactured. The connections between the characters are forced and lack the nuance that would make a story like this successful.

5450,937,935,"Weve run into Archer and Elle before in the Heartbreaker Bay series.  Two among several friends who are as close as family, yet these two have always had a certain spark between then a spark that both would put down to annoyance before theyd admit to attraction.  In Accidentally on Purpose we get a better understanding of their history, and perhaps why one is such a silent guardian and the others is in complete denial about feelings that have always been there, simply ignored.

Sometimes in a series with a lot of tight characters with individual and group friendships its easy to pick out in advance who you think will end up together eventually in spite of all their nonsense fighting.  It was obvious that Archer and Elle would make up one of the couples as early as the first story, Sweet Little Lies,  Love hate relationship much?  Yeah, indeed.  Elle is a strong woman who has built her life from scratch herself.  Self-reliant, stubborn as a woman can get she has no need for a relationship or a man to define her place in this world.  Yet Archer pushes buttons that shes constantly discovering about herself.  On one hand she wants him like crazy, on the other shes scared.  But shell never admit to that.  Archer saved her on one of the most awful nights of her life.  And while he says theres no payback necessary shes always felt that there could be nothing between them simply because Archer is the billboard for the strong, silent type of man.  She offered once, and when he refused well she was done.  Trouble is, Elle didn't understand why he refused and its taken a lot of years to finally really hear his answer.  When her sister, Morgan, gets in touch again bringing trouble with her again, Elle shuts her out and it will take one strong, silent and stubborn man to get her to open up to either her sister or the man who loves her.

Im enjoying getting to know all of the cast of characters in this series a little bit better with each book.  Accidentally on Purpose is full of sass and heat, tenderness and lust, friendship and that special something that happens between the right man and the right woman.  I enjoyed every moment of my time in this world  and now Im looking forward to seeing how Elle and Archer are as an established couple in the rest of the series.  Yeah, those extra bits of the lives of all of these friends is what makes this series special to me.  Id recommend Accidentally on Purpose, or any story in this series to Romance readers who enjoy a solid story line, believable characters and those extra touches that make a story a community of friends.  Because relationships are formed and the group dynamic changes because of this I would recommend reading this series in order for the best flow and enjoyment.

Musing on her never-aired talk show for Disney, she writes, ""To make a long story short, I was basically incapable of asking other people about their lives without going on and on and on about my own."" Fortunately, this trait is ideal for a memoirist--Lewis's tales are acerbic, entertaining and brutally honest.

Born in Missouri, the youngest of seven children, Lewis always knew she'd be a star. Her career took off immediately. One day after graduating from college, she moved to New York City, and 10 days later made her debut on Broadway in Eubie! with Gregory Hines. She played Effie in the workshop production of the musical Dreamgirls, but lost the role to Jennifer Holliday when it moved to Broadway. Touring as a backup singer to Bette Midler, she forged a friendship but realized she couldn't sing in anyone's shadow.

Her manic behavior, spending binges, crying jags and the reliance on alcohol and sex to numb her feelings were later diagnosed as bipolar disorder. The second half of Lewis's memoir delves deeply into her therapy, a troubled relationship with her mother and her fear that mood-stabilizing drugs might dilute her persona. This outstanding, no-holds-barred memoir is captivating, thoughtful, disarmingly frank and unforgettable. The book, like its author, is a treasure.

Brash and outrageous singer/actress Jenifer Lewis defies expectations with a brilliantly funny memoir that also deals frankly with her bipolar disorder, addiction and recovery.",1515110400,5

I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, especially anything set during one of the war periods. In the past, my exposure to WWI and WWII have been mostly from an American viewpoint, so I found the Europe an setting and perspective to be especially interesting.

This book was well-written, the characters and plot were well-developed, and I found myself lost in its pages from the first chapter.

I appreciated the history lesson alongside the fictional plot, and I found myself enjoying the book as well as learning a lot about the spy networks in WWI.

I definitely recommend adding this book to your reading queue!

The old guard (including George Smiley) have been retired or shuffled off to unimportant corners of the institutionbut it looks like someone in the new leadership is a Karla-trained Soviet mole; a mole who may have been in place for decades. The main plot follows George Smiley and his few trusted allies on their methodical mole hunt.

The story can be a bit fragmented and confusing (e.g. it takes quite a while to see the relevance of the opening story line), but this is part of the brilliance as Smiley slowly pulls all the pieces into place to make a coherent picture. Some of the action and leaps of reason toward the end were almost too elliptical to follow, but its obvious why this is a classic of realistic spy fiction.",1515110400,4

Combing through the damage done by the mole, George Smiley (now the interim head of the much reduced intelligence agency) discovers an opportunity to interfere with and profit from Karlas intelligence apparatus in the far East. Much of the story is based in Hong Kong and branches out through various conflict zones in the waning days of the Vietnam War. It focuses mostly on an unreliable, womanizing British field agent who uses his cover as a reporter to travel around and pry into all kinds of sordid corners.

To me the book seemed meandering and overlong. LeCarr seems more interested in describing the horrors and corruption of Southeast Asian politics, warfare, opium smuggling, etc. than he does in really advancing the Smiley vs. Karla storyline. Many of the George Smiley bits felt more like maneuvering characters into place for the next book than anything directly related to the plot.

I've been curious about the TV show for ages though and several friends have raved about the show and begged me to watch it so I decided it was about time I gave the book a try (I can't possibly watch the show without reading the book first!). Anyway, I'm very happy that I fell into the ""love it"" camp, I can totally understand why some of my friends didn't enjoy it - there were some disturbing things about Claire and Jamie's relationship (particularly in the beginning) and there were a lot of references to rape and an actual rape towards the end of the book (although it was surprisingly a male character who was the victim which I wasn't expecting) - but in spite of the issues I was totally immersed in this world and couldn't put it down.

Outlander is one of those books that pulled me in from pretty much the first page and didn't let me go until the end. Considering it's quite a long book (865 pages for my copy) I finished it in just three days which should tell you something about how much I enjoyed it! I loved meeting these characters, I loved taking a trip back in time and most of all I fell hard for Jamie even though I wanted to slap him a couple of times! There are already thousands of reviews for this book out there so there's probably nothing I can say that hasn't been said hundreds of times before so I'm just tell you that I'm now even more excited about watching the TV series and I can't wait to dive into the next book.

Ive been wanting to read this author seems like forever!  I finally took the plunge and decided to read out of order, which is mostly what has kept me from trying her in the past.  THE ART OF RUNNING IN HEELS was a fun hockey romance and a great sampler for me of Ms. Gibsons style.  It has left me wanting to read more for sure.

Lexie is the daughter of the Seattle Chinooks coach.  Shes also a business owner trying to get some exposure for her doggie clothing line who decided the best way to get free advertising was to go on a reality TV dating show.  Except she didn't expect too actually win and end up about to get married to the eligible bachelor.  So she does what any sane young woman would do in her situation.  She ends up running away the day of the wedding, dress and all.  And thats what lands her right on Seans lap.  Sean, who plays for the Chinooks and is one of the players her father dislikes.

The great thing about this book is that I feel like its very light-hearted and even if some things cant be taken too seriously, it brought a smile to my face.  Which is exactly what I like my cute contemporaries to do.  It felt very reminiscent of Susan Elizabeth Phillips.  Not too steamy, not too complicated, light-hearted fun with a sexy hero.

I cant say Lexie was my kind of heroine which is probably one of the things that kept me from giving this a higher rating.  Not quite TSTL but she was a bit immature in some respects and that detracted from her other accomplishments in my eyes.

If you are looking for some light-hearted, angst-free, cute hockey romance then I think this is the series for you.",1515110400,4
5464,686,1650,"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.

Reality TV meets hockey and what a whirlwind it is. Sean Knox is new to the Chinooks but he knows who Lexie Kowalsky is, even she doesn't recognize him. Hard to believe since her dad is is the coach.

But since she's now playing the role of a runaway bride, he doesn't think she's got her mind on anything other than her problems. Lexie decided to be a contestant on Gettin Hitched as a way to promote her doggie clothing company. Only thinking of winning, she doesn't realize that getting married is not something that she wants to until five minutes before she's due to walk down the aisle. Running off to Canada seems like a good idea, anything to get away from the media circus that has become her life.

Sean has had enough drama to last a lifetime and he doesn't need anymore. However, something draws him toward Lexie and he's unable to stay away from her. One night with her is more than he imagined he would ever have.

When he finds that the drama surrounding her is now pulling him into her orbit once again, he can't help but offer his help. He can't do it on her terms exactly, but if he can save her reputation he will do anything in power to help her.

This is a wonderfully written take on how trials and travails of falling in love/lust on reality TV and what happens when the cameras stop rolling.

I'm an AHS fan, so weird is good. If you are less comfortable with a supernatural, mysterious plotline with multiple characters and intermingled stories, this might not be a story for you.

5470,237,380,"Maybe you, like me, have read so many World War II novels you're feeling oversaturated (did I make up that word?) with them. SONS AND SOLDIERS is different. First, its fact, not a novel. Second, it should make you want to turn its pages like it is your first World War II book because this is probably a story you haven't heard before.

This is a true story about the Ritchie Boys, six of them in particular. They were Jews who grew up in 1930s Germany when it was being changed by the Nazi party. SONS AND SOLDIERS follows these six from then to their escaping Germany for the United States to their eventual service in the U.S. Army. At Camp Ritchie in Maryland, each of them learned to interrogate German POWs (and French people in some cases).  In this way, these men become heroes for the valuable information they extracted that helped us win World War II.

SONS AND SOLDIERS is not just a book about war and its not even just a book about the injustices the Nazi party imposed on Jews. This book is also full of real incidences in the lives of each of the six Ritchie Boys from the time they entered the army to the end of the war with Germany.

The writing style of this story annoyed me for sooooo many reasons. Namely, the CONSTANT interjections by the dang narrator! Throughout the entire book there are these comments from the narrator (in parentheses) that yank me out of the story, are annoying beyond reason, and have no purpose other than to take away all suspense and interest from the reader! Its beyond annoying! Its infuriating!

The second reason this book was so annoying because of the god-awful lightheartedness with which it was written! This is about conspiracies of the royal court, but it has the tonality of an adorable, fluffy, (gag-worthy) contemporary. The gravity of the situations the characters are in are completely lacking in tension because of the way this was written in. What a waste.

Unoriginal
God. Where do I even start with this particular comment other than to say: I hope they got full rights from the original creators of the material they used in this book because otherwise its referred to as stealing. And from whom did they use material, you ask? Let me start a list: Shakespeare, Monty Pythons Holy Grail, The Princess Bride, Alice in Wonderland. Are you serious? You have three authors working on this book and you cant even come up with your OWN lines? And you have to use someone elses very easily recognizable lines, at that?! Not only did they steal lines, but they also stole fundamental aspects from them and other movies, like Tangled. For crimeny sakes, this is just pathetic. (And also very infuriating.)

Wait What are we doing now?
At some point in the book, I wasn't sure if I was reading a historical fantasy piece written by three authors or an awful piece of fanfiction written by a high school student. Why? Because of the randomness with which the plot would suddenly turn. OH! And the inaccuracies of travel time. Yes, yes. I get that this was an embellishment of the original history, but does that also mean its allowed to forego all common, accepted believability of story telling? I don't think so.

What is pacing?
This book is definitely one of those where the authors had no idea what pacing was and just tried to cram as much in as possible. Why? Because thats literally how it reads. Everything happens SUPER fast with hardly any breathing room and yet the characters manage to progress and develop over the span of like two weeks or some unlikely short amount of time. And the rushing got even worse towards the end. For being such a long book, I would have expected some semblance of pacing or realism.",1515196800,1
5473,767,224,"I must have been living under a rock when Molly Blooms story came out because it wasn't until I saw the movie Mollys Game that I heard about her. Then I came straight home and read her book MOLLYS GAME: THE TRUE STORY OF THE 26-YEAR OLD WOMAN BEHIND THE MOST EXCLUSIVE, HIGH-STAKES UNDERGROUND POKER GAME IN THE WORLD like my life depended on it. Ok, wow. Mollys got game and then some. Here is what I can tell you because, no spoilers. Plus, Molly is the storyteller here.

Molly comes from a family of high achievers. She is no slouch. A champion skier, brains to match, fresh out of college with plans to attend law school. She has been on the go since she was a little girl and wants a break in between. Her parents don't agree. She heads to LA, on her own, and lands jobs to pay the bills that lead to her first poker game with the big boys and she likes what she sees. Molly is not a gambler, nor does she have any interest in the game. It is all about the connections and she knows an opportunity for a legitimate business is looking right at her.

With equal parts passion and drive, Molly achieves more than she imagined. Then things came to a crashing halt. Find out what happens after that. I have much respect for her. She is protective of people, to a fault, and most likely you will come away from the book, with a very, very bad taste for some people, who are named. As Molly tells her story, you will be turning pages as fast as a dealer pitches cards in the air.",1515196800,5
5474,181,1697,"Arent we all hesitant to pick up a new YA Fantasy novel? Arent we all afraid that itll be more of the same?

You neednt worry with this one.

If Im being completely honest, I had little interest in reading Everless, but I scored an advance copy so I said, why not? HOLY CRAP THIS BOOK HOOKED ME FROM THE FIRST PAGE AND THE ONLY REASON I DIDNT READ IT IN A DAY WAS BECAUSE I HAD TO WORK.

This book had all the things I want in a fantasy. And yes, theres some trope-y things, but lets be honest, you cant really escape tropes at this point. However, these tropes don't feel like tropes because they feel new and interesting and are so subtle that they're hardly there.

I don't think I can explain how fully I enjoyed reading Everless, because everything about this book made me love it even more. The characters, the plot, the narration. Every sentence got me more hooked, and to be honest-made me understand what was going on even less and I adored it for that.

Normally, I can figure out the ending of a book easily, but this one had me guessing until the very end. I couldn't figure out if this was a lost princess story, a chosen one story, or just something else, until it was literally revealed in a magical kind of way for me. This book will keep you on your toes, trying to figure out what direction it wants to take, in the best way possible.

Theres subtle romance that I cannot wait to see more of, theres plot twists, and conviving characters, and theres family ties and frustrations, and loss and sorrow, and strength and fight.

Everless is original and engaging, fun and interesting, and leaves you wanting to keep on reading until the last page. I stayed up until 12am to finish this, not caring that I had to work the next day.

Theres so much packed into this book. Even the little details are beautiful and mesmerizing. I loved every second of it, and cannot wait to see where it continues.

Everless is a strong, unique addition to the YA Fantasy world-and it will not hide in the shadows.",1515196800,5

This book is amazing. I love Adam's writing and it just keeps getting better. I had serious emotions the entire book. How do you live when you know you're going to die at any second? How do you not live when you know you're going to die at any second?

It has been a long time since I've cried during a read, I actually look forward to those books. Goodbyes are hard especially with people you care about and boy do I care about these characters. I love Mateo and Rufus. I love that they found each other for this day. I wish they found each other sooner. The Plutos and Lidia are serious friendship goals.

5478,555,1654,"I read my first Cathy Maxwell book ""You and No Other"" in 1996 and have been a fan ever since.

I especially loved this book and the heroine, Leonie Charnock.  She has been alone her whole life, she has a mother and a father who only care about themselves.  Her mother takes numerous lovers and her father cares for nothing but his drink and his money.  So she has never had anyone to love or love her.  When she was 17 she had two handsome gentlemen vying for her attention, she chose the wrong one and has paid for it for the past ten years.  She has no idea that the traumatic assault that she experienced years ago is responsible for her behavior.  Her mother and father glossed over the incident and she never truly examined how she was responsible and how it has affected her whole life.  Until she sees the gentleman who rescued her and kept her secrets.

Roman Gilchrist is now an Earl with an estate mired in debt.  He must marry an heiress and he knows exactly who he wants.  She owes him.  He is determined to marry Leonie, after all, he has always wanted her and now he has the chance to have her.  Her dowry of 50,000 pounds will restore his estate and allow him to take care of the people who depend on him.

When they married, Roman had no idea that Leonie was hiding a secret vice that could destroy everything that he had worked for.  Can Leonie put her past behind her and become the wife and lover that Roman loves or will the live separate lives.

What I loved about this novel is that Leonie is the damaged soul in this story.  Roman is not perfect but it is Leonie who is the tortured heroine.  I do not give away spoilers in my reviews so you will have to find out for yourself if Leonie and Roman will get their happily ever after.

5480,767,819,"I have been waiting for a book to hook me once again to the drama that only a mix of unstable people thrown together can bring and the gripping road that they take you on. Our protagonist Anna, has agoraphobia, and keeps herself occupied by looking at life through her window, consuming enough wine each day for a party of 10 all while mixing with meds like they're chasers, and watching classic films, which have now replaced real conversations. She does have visitors  her therapist (yes, he makes house calls) and her physical therapist who acts as more of a therapist.

You might be thinking where is the thrill if this woman doesnt even leave her house. Oh, but there is her view and her mind, which is a powerful thing. I had a few hunches and definitely some chills. You will be scared, creeped out, and maybe even doing that thing where you talk out loud to the character urging her to do something. If you do that sort of thing.

This book is very character-driven and friendship is a big theme in it. I don't mind that in particular, I enjoyed it in fact, but A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet at least had an overall arc throughout the book and this one just hasn't. The pace was, moreover, a bit too slow for my liking and then the end wrapped up too nicely and fast. The characters are the heart of the story, though, and I loved them dearly. Becky Chambers is a pro in characterization.

5483,280,1480,"I didn't want the story to end! This book proceeded at a snail's pace in two dimensions. First, I read it as slowly as humanly possible. I savored it. Second, because I was reading so slowly, I realized I had only progressed a few hours in book time.

Loretta Chase dragged out the action and basically slowed everything down. It felt like a real time journey. Olympia Hightower is the original runaway bride. She pulls a bolt on her wedding day. The Duke of Ripley has been charged as the groom's best friend to ensure that his wedding proceeds with no complications. Alas, a drunken bride absconding from a window may just be a complication. Ripley gives chase and hilarity ensues.

I loved everything about this book. I can't wait to watch this series unfold. So many questions arose, but especially I would love to know what is going on with the Duke and Duchess of Blackwood. His Grace with the Angel Face as well was quite an interesting character.

5491,519,75,"When a mysterious notice appears in the Chipping Cleghorn Gazette, the villagers don't take it very seriously.

A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks at 6.30 p.m. Friends please accept this, the only intimation.

The prevailing feeling is that this is a rather odd invitation from Miss Letitia Blacklock, owner of Little Paddocks, perhaps to some kind of murder mystery evening. So all her friends decide to show up at the appointed time. Miss Blacklock knows nothing about it but, being a sensible woman, she realises the villagers are likely to descend on her and makes preparations for a little drinks party anyway. Once everyone is assembled, a shocking event occurs and the end result is that a man lies dead. It's up to the police, ably assisted by Miss Marple, to find out who he was and why he died...

This has always been one of my favourite Christies, mainly because I thinks she excels herself in both plotting and characterisation. It also has one of the best beginnings, as Christie ranges round the village introducing us to all the characters by means of telling us which newspapers they routinely have delivered. Newspapers in Britain have always been such an indicator of class, social position, education, political standpoint; and Christie uses this brilliantly to very quickly telegraph (no pun intended) the social mix of the village.

Published in 1950, this is post-war Britain, and the first chapter gives us a little microcosm of British middle-class society of the time  old soldiers, the traditionally rich fading into genteel poverty, the new business classes taking over as the wealthy ones, women beginning to find their place in the workforce, people displaced from their original homes forming a mobile and fluctuating population, so that even in villages neighbours no longer know all the long histories of their neighbours  now people have to be judged on what they choose to reveal of themselves. Anyone who thinks Golden Age crime fiction has nothing much to say about society should read this chapter and think again. Christie, of course, understood totally that crime fiction is first and foremost an entertainment though, so all this information is transmitted with warmth and humour, and all in the space of a few hundred words. Many modern crime writers would probably take 150 pages, bore us all to death, and still not produce anything half as insightful...

There is one aspect of the book I don't enjoy and that's the treatment of Mitzi, Miss Blacklock's foreign maid. A war refugee from Eastern Europe, she is portrayed with a kind of cruel casualness  her anxiety dismissed as hysteria, her horror stories of her life in the war dismissed as either exaggeration or with an attitude of contempt for her not having the British stiff upper lip. It's odd, because this book also has some of Christie's kindest and most moving characterisations  poor old Bunny, Miss Blacklock's companion, who shows us all the tragedy of the genteel poor at that time, and the Misses Hinchcliffe and Murgatroyd, never openly described as lesbian, but portrayed with great sympathy and warmth.

I'm not going to give any details of the plot for fear of spoilers. However, this is entirely fair play  not only are all the clues in there, but Miss Marple kindly summarises them all towards the end to give us one last chance to solve it for ourselves. I've read this one so often over the years that I know whodunit and why and now I can more or less anticipate the clues before we get to them, but I think I was suitably baffled first time I read it. Even knowing how it all works out, I still find it an immensely enjoyable read, allowing me to admire Christie's skill at its remarkable height.

This time around I listened to the wonderful Joan Hickson narrating it. She really is perfect for the Miss Marple books. Her old-fashioned accent is just right, and she completely gets the tone of the books  the mixture of tragedy and humour, the sympathy for human foibles and weaknesses, the little romantic interludes. In this one she made me laugh with the younger characters and moved me to tears with Bunny's story (I've always had a huge soft spot for Bunny  she's one of my favourite Christie characters). Marvellous stuff  the ideal partnership of author and narrator. Highly recommended.",1515196800,5

5510,920,914,"This is a snappy and highly entertaining memoir of life on the road with the seminal rock band Van Halen, from its earliest salad days in the late 1970s to the breakup of its original lineup in 1985, as told by its former manager, Noel Monk. Monk tells a story of sensational debauchery, immaturity, egotism and dysfunction, balanced by legendary talent (in Eddie Van Halen) and equally legendary ambition (in David Lee Roth). Many of the antics he describes -- drugs, alcohol, groupies, fights, arrests, pranks, publicity stunts -- is are so cliched as to be familiar in advance, but Monk doesn't leave it at the tawdry surface details. He takes the reader on a journey through the music industry of the late 1970s - early-mid 1980s, when it was at the height of its power and influence, and explains the complex and often Byzantine world of rock management, including ""payola"" (illegal pay-for-play deals), the never-ending war between labels and bootleggers (often violent), various contract shenanigans, and of course the incredible logistical feat of touring all over the world with four drunken, drug-addled juvenile delinquents who couldn't get along, but who brought a level of passion, genius and give-it-their-all intensity to the stage and studio that had just plain never been seen before.

A year or two ago I fulfilled a lifelong dream by getting to see Van Halen -- with David Lee Roth at the microphone -- play at the Hollywood Bowl, but as I stood there, chanting the lyrics to ""Jump"" and ""Drop Dead Legs"" and all the other classics, I couldn't help but wonder: Why did it take so long for me to be able to fulfill an ambition I'd had since high school, i.e. the late 1980s? Why do these guys always find ways to shoot themselves in the foot and frustrate their fans? Why wasn't original bassist Michael Anthony -- universally acknowledged as one of the nicest guys in the rock business -- missing from the lineup? Why does every appearance of on-stage brotherhood immediately get sabotaged and contradicted by bitter, caustic interviews with rock magazines a week later? Why, in short, is Van Halen its own worst enemy? Noel Monk has the answers, and sad as they are, they make fascinating reading.

To be sure, Monk presents himself in the most flattering possible light at all times, often at the expense of everyone else, but any gloss he places over his memories does little to obscure the picture of Van Halen as a band with unlimited musical potential, which destroyed itself at the precise moment it was poised to rule the rock world. And indeed, there is something fitting in that. Who wants, or even respects, a rock band that faces down all of its demons, kicks drugs and booze, settles into monogamous relationships, learns to sign contracts intelligently and spend its money shrewdly, and generally behaves like a smooth-running corporation? What we want is chaos, immaturity, vandalism, irresponsibility, debauchery and spectacle. And with Van Halen during the Roth years, we got all of that, plus some of the best rock 'n roll ever recorded. Monk may have lost when he was fired from the band in 1985, but we, the listeners, won. I can't recommend this book highly enough for fans of Van Halen, but I'd also endorse it to anyone interested in the brutal mechanics of the music business.",1515283200,4
5511,220,19,"So much revealed here in Book Two, including much of what I was working to figure out as I finished Book One. The Invasion of the Tearling picks up exactly where The Queen of the Tearling left off - no years going by in a twinkle, nothing solved or shoved aside. Queen Kelsea remains on the throne, but its a precarious perch, to be sure: the invasion of the Tearling by the Mortmesne Army is close at hand. As war beckons and breaks, however, the Glynn Queens own power grows. Her transformation from child to Queen dominates the books narrative arc, of course. But other important stories swell alongside Kelseas own, and more than a few characters - some already well established, others new - become essential, lively, complicated. This book offers a much darker vision than the first, but don't let that scare you away, because theres still room for wonder, and second chances abound.
Erika Johansen is a marvelous talent. I thought Id made good time reading through Book One - I couldn't put it down - but I *blazed* through Book Two.

5518,284,372,"This is a lovely murder mystery that gives a great treatment of King Richard the Third of England. For the setup, a police detective, laid up for recovery, is bored out of his mind and needs a puzzle. Looking at old portraits, he sees one of Richard, and starts to unravel the secrets behind one of the villains of Shakespeare.
The trouble is, Richard might not have been such a villain as painted by the greatest playwright.

Look, I see a lot of differing reviews on this book. I think if you are able to listen to the Audible version you would like it better. The many actors bring this far-fetched story alive. The narrators: Ron McLarty, Daniel Oreskes, and full cast (whatever that means) make you see gods, goddesses and dead people and other characters. They help you feel the cold, the pain, smell rot or smoke.

I don't know if I would have liked the book had I just read it without the Audible narration. I think it might have been more meandering and possibly boring. What kept me going was wanting to see what would happen to the main character. And having a bit of interest in other religions and cultures I wanted to see how Neil Gaiman would portray them and the war between them as they were fading into the obscurity of disbelief.

This wasn't my favorite book. It is very male-heavy. Goddesses and women were given little time or depth. BUT I doubt I will forget it and may want to read it again in a few years and see how it affects me then.

5521,352,1250,"When I read the Winter King I spent a long time just loving the fact it was a romance with a high fantasy setting. It was the first Romantasy book I ever found so it is really special to me and I spent years waiting for the sequel to come out. I wish I could say it exceeded my expectations but it fell a little short of its predecessor still I have very high hopes for the overall series.

Dilys is really everything you can hope for in a suitor. He is smart, charming, fun, devoted and is practically a merman. He doesnt have a tail or anything but he does carry some magic over the water and gills while he is in it. He needs a wife and goes to the Winter court to woo one of the seasons. Accept the only season his people told him not to pick is of course the one he finds irresistible from the beginning.

Summer has been hiding the strength of her gifts for years. She is stronger and more deadly than anyone realizes. Most of the world considers her the weakest Season and so kind and soft that she would never be a good match for the strong willed and warring Calbernans that have come courting and she wants to keep it that way. That is until she sees Dilys and something in her wakes up and demands she fight for the man that calls to all the power inside of her.

  What in Heloss name had just happened? The Calbernan had turned unexpectedly and caught her gaze upon him and then
  She dragged in a breath, then another. Ragged. Shaken. She couldn't even begin to describe what had happened. It was as if, with one look, hed dived into the deepest, most secret parts of her soul, places no one  not even she  had ever been.

Overall this is a solid story. It was more courting and trying to convince Summer that she is the girl for him once they figure some stuff out but it was interesting to see all the Calbernanas in Wintercraig to court widows and other single women from the war. They are quite charming and do woo well.

  If a woman was unattached and in possession of a pulse, she would not long remain unwilling in the face of a determined Calbernans courtship.

This is the first book though in a look time that I had to put down and walk away from after a few chapters. There are about 4-5 chapters that deal with human trafficking in a very personal way. While it is well written it was also extremely disturbing to me and emotionally I needed some time away to recover. This hit on a few of my hot buttons and so I struggled a little.

I think like the Winter King this ended up being a little longer than it needed to be. At 608 pages it is on the hefty side for straight up romance. But there is also the rich fantasy world of magic and unknown forces at play. There might even be a god or two in the mix. Im extremely interested in what direction the story will take in the Jaguar King and which Season will get to tame the beast. Im thinking that will be in Autumns skill set but we will see. Hopefully there won't be three years between books this time around.",1515283200,3

Its long, over 800 pages long. Reading it was tedious at times, especially all the details with war strategy and military plans, which doesnt interest me much at all. However, Im so glad that I stuck with it. Its not great literature, but the story and portrayal of characters are what made it for me. I especially loved the patriarch of the family, Victor Pug Henry  strong, upright, old school, my type of man. I look forward to reading the sequel.

It is better to keep your mouth shut and let people think you're a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt.

This one refers to the relief that Victor Henry felt after being in Berlin for a while. I can relate to this, since I feel that Americans are more genuine than most. I always say that you know where you stand with them. I know that others reading this may not appreciate my generalization, but oh well.
Victor Henry loved being back among American faces, American talk, offhand open manners, laughter from the diaphragm and not from the face muscles, not a bow or a clicked pair of heels, not a womans European smile, gleaming on and off like an electric sign.

5532,187,1688,"Rudyard Kiplings Kim (published in 1901) was rather educational to read, although somewhat trying in deciphering the English/Indian language of the late 1800s British controlled India. Kim Ohara was a orphaned white boy running around India thinking and acting like he was a Hindu Indian when he meets an aged and possibly mad Tibetan lama, who is on a pilgrimage. I didn't read Miguel de Cervantes novel, Don Quixote (1605), but I am familiar with the novel and the story of Kim reminded me of that classic tale. In Kim, a Tibetan lama was on a pilgrimage to find a holy River while Don Quixote was on a  knight-errant search for chivalrous adventures...a perfect match. Both seemed mad as a hatter (were they really?). Kim became the lamas chela (disciple), while Sancho became Don Quixotes squire. Like Sancho, Kim is forced to deceive his master (?) at times. Anyway, both novels are not an easy read. I keep reading the classics, because I believe it makes me a better reviewer who can then authoritatively compare modern novels with the distinguished novels of yesteryear. Does that make sense? So whats Kim all about? Im glad you asked...or did you?

Kim is a poor orphaned white boy who wears Hindu garb and is loosely watched over by a half caste woman. His father, a British soldier, and mother are both dead. Around Kims neck is a amulet that explains who he is. He gets his meals where he can and does odd jobs for the local merchants of Lahore City, including the horse trader, Mahbub Ali. One day Kim meets a lama from Tibet in front of the Wonder House Museum, who says that he is on a pilgrimage to Benares to find a holy river that absolves one of all sins. The lama tells the Curator of the Wonder House of Lahore about his quest on page 13, Listen to a true thing. When our gracious Lord (Buddha), being as yet a youth, sought a mate, men said, in his fathers Court, that He was too tender for marriage. Thou knowest? The Curator nodded, wondering what would come next. So they made the triple trial of strength against all comers. And at the test of the bow, our Lord first breaking that which they gave Him, called for such a bow as none might bend. Thou knowest? It is written. I have read. And, overshooting all other marks, the arrow passed far and far beyond sight. At the last it fell; and, where it touched earth, there broke out a stream which presently became a River, whose nature, by our Lords beneficence, and that merit He acquired ere He freed himself, is that whoso bathes in it washes away all taint and speckle of sin. So it is written, said the Curator sadly. Now you might think that I made a lot of mistakes in the above text in punctuation and capitalization, but sorry...I only put it  down exactly the same way Rudyard Kipling wrote it. And who can question his writing ability?

Since the lama was on a holy quest, he only brought his begging bowl with him. It was up to Kim, now the lamas chela, to find food and shelter each night after their days walk. At the end of the first days walk, they end up at a large courtyard for overnight caravans. Kim has had previous dealings with the local horse trader, Mahbub Ali. Kim ask for money for food from Mahbub on page 23. And Mahbub says to Kim, And if thou wilt carry a message for me as far as Umballa, I will give thee money. It concerns a horse-a white stallion which I have sold to an officer upon the last time I returned from the Passes. But then-stand nearer and hold up hands as begging-the pedigree of the white stallion was not fully established, and that officer, who is now at Umballa, bade me make it clear. The message will prove the pedigree of the white stallion. Kim agrees to take the message, but He knew he had rendered a service to Mahbub Ali, and not for one little minute did he believe the tale of the stallions pedigree. Who really is Mahbub Ali? After a short sleep, Kim said to the lama, Come. It is time-time to go to Benares The lama rose obediently, and they passed out of the serai (caravansary) like shadows. I hope my 23 page recap whet your appetite for the rest of the novel. There is a lot of adventure ahead if you can fist fight your way through the tough vernacular of late 1800s India. This novel is not for everyone. It will test your mettle, but make you feel like you accomplished something noteworthy...and you did.",1515283200,5

Abby is a pretty typical seventeen-year-oldshe thinks she has her life pretty much figured out in a lot of ways but then something happens that shakes her belief in herself and her insecurities come rushing in. Im sure that a lot of YA readers will be able to relate to this. Family ties are incredibly important in the story. Abbys relationship with her mom (who struggles with agoraphobia) and her dad (who is stationed overseas, but we still get to see him via email and Skype) are central to the story. And her grandfather is also a huge part of her life (and hes utterly lovable!). My only issue with the book was that I was a bit unsure of where it was all going and how things were going to end with the romancethis was one of those cases where I truly wasn't sure the main characters were going to get togetheror if they should. I felt like Cooper was possibly leading Abby on a bit sometimes and I wasn't sure if she was going to end up with him or Elliott in the end.

5534,711,1548,"The cover of this book promises a biography of Robert de La Rochefoucauld, the Saboteur of the title, that is as fast-paced and emotionally intuitive as the very best spy thrillers --- and it delivers just that. Paul Kixs debut nonfiction account is based on La Rochefoucaulds own memoir, but he has supplemented it with careful research to broaden the focus and provide context for his subjects remarkable story. In so doing, he also has made it accessible to readers who may not be totally familiar with how World War II was fought beyond the trenches.

Born into one of the oldest and most aristocratic French families, La Rochefoucauld was a teenager when the Nazis invaded France in 1939. By lying about his age, he set out the following year to join Charles de Gaulles Free French, which was operating out of London. He made his way to Spain, but was caught and imprisoned --- before making the first of three amazing escapes from captivity.

After La Rochefoucauld made his way to London, a chance encounter resulted in an offer to join the fledgling Special Operations Executive, Winston Churchills brainchild. He agreed to do so, but only if de Gaulle supported the decision. When he was ushered into the Generals presence and posed the question, de Gaulles response was typical: Its still for France, even if its allied with the Devil. Go!

After intensive training, La Rochefoucauld parachuted into Vichy France to work with the Resistance, but was soon captured and imprisoned. Conditions at the prison near the town of Auxerre were appalling, and he was regularly tortured. Finally, La Rochefoucauld was tried and sentenced to death --- but, on his way to the firing squad, he decided to overcome his drivers and make a run for it. His escape involved stealing an SS car and dressing as a nun, and thanks to sympathetic villagers, he managed to evade capture, once again making his way to London.

La Rochefoucaulds last mission turns out to be both his most dangerous and the most brazen. Kixs description of hanging from netting above a casement that surrounded a Nazi stronghold is vivid, and La Rochefoucaulds success in destroying the almost impregnable garrison was celebrated by his confr&egrave;res.

The story doesnt quite end there. In a surprising twist, years after the war, La Rochefoucauld found himself confronting a man accused of collaborating with the Nazis and was forced to decide if he believed in his innocence. His decision reflects the courage he exhibited in wartime.

THE SABOTEUR is a book about one man overcoming his own fear in service of his homeland, but Paul Kix uses Robert de La Rochefoucaulds experiences to explore what it was like to survive in a country overtaken by the enemy, and the courage it took to fight back when those around you have acquiesced. Its an inspiring tale.

5536,711,1726,"Nearly two decades before embarking on the five years of intensive research that would result in his compelling new biography, CHARLES DARWIN: VICTORIAN MYTHMAKER, A. N. (Andrew Norman) Wilson recalls visiting the iconic British naturalists beloved home and refuge of Down House in Kent. Something about the apparently casual 1990s visit, he muses near the end of more than 400 pages, deeply planted a little seed that sparked a big projects long gestation.

By the time Id reached that point in an intensely satisfying reading experience --- especially for a non-scientist --- I could trust Wilsons informed and even prescient choice behind every noun, verb and descriptor, including the rather clinical-sounding gestation. Nothing more aptly describes the meticulous care and sensibility (another great Victorian term!) this prolific and wide-ranging British author of some four-dozen titles has poured into the first substantial single-volume Darwin biography published in more than a generation.

Unlike the vast majority of biographies about people so famous it would seem all has been said and written about them previously, Wilson departs from focusing exclusively on Charles Darwin, the individual behind ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES (1859). Instead, he draws into Darwins personal and professional orbits the fascinating history of the evolutionary idea itself, probing deeply into its convoluted social, religious, political and scientific context for Victorians and their descendants.

This is not only a much harder literary and scholarly feat to pull off convincingly --- it is also a far more courageous approach, one that opens with the ringing first-page proclamation, Darwin was wrong. As expected, those three assertive little words have drawn much fire from 21st-century Neo-Darwinists over the few weeks since the books launch in December 2017.

But theres a powerful point to be made here, and Wilson makes it incomparably well throughout 17 absorbing chapters that cast an astonishingly wide net. The rest of CHARLES DARWIN: VICTORIAN MYTHMAKER painstakingly, yet often poetically, dissects some of the vast body of decades-long interactions, connections and correspondence that on numerous occasions caused even Darwin himself to feel that parts of his never-quite-gelled evolutionary theory were, in fact, wrong.

In revealing the eclectic journey of the evolutionary idea, which Darwin pointedly did not invent on his own, Wilsons account follows multiple threads of scientific inquiry that the reclusive, unpredictable and inconsistent genius maintained with scores of other great gentlemen scientists of his era. More often than not, he answered colleagues criticisms and suggested corrections by revising his own work in light of rapidly developing Victorian scientific knowledge and new evidence. As a prime example, Wilson reminds us at several key points that no fewer than six revised editions of ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES had appeared during the 23 years before Darwins death in 1882 and that the changes incorporated into each succeeding one are all important to the history of evolution --- an idea that in itself just kept on evolving with every new technological advance and unprecedented fossil discovery.

Throughout CHARLES DARWIN: VICTORIAN MYTHMAKER, Wilson deftly illustrates that as Darwins influence spread through multiple layers of Victorian society, it drew public attention to science and scientists as never before. ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES (not even his most popular work at the time) attracted avid readership from nobility to the working classes. Darwin, himself no overnight success as a scientist, nevertheless came along at a time when British society was experiencing a huge collective hunger for accessible knowledge about where life comes from, how it survives and adapts, where humans --- scientifically, not supernaturally --- fit into the great scheme of things, whether nature even needed God. In attempting to come to grips with such persistent and unsettling issues, Darwin and his colleagues virtually invented the proactive popularization of science. (Where would todays television hosts be without them?)

So rather than hailing Darwin as the stand-alone originator of an evolutionary theory that proposed to answer all the big questions of how and why sentient life populates planet Earth, Wilson situates the great and still-revered botanist-naturalist in a more meaningful and challenging role as a supremely accomplished catalyst, one whose work exposed scientific and philosophical problems that once had been the exclusive domain of elite mens clubs and academia. Whether intentionally or not, Darwin, so human in his failings yet so extraordinary in intellect, did indeed capture, proclaim and share the great Victorian myth, not as a substitute for scientific fact but as a place from which new truths continue to emerge.

And as Darwin himself did so well, A. N. Wilson succeeds by presenting the fascinating and continuing history of evolution in symphonic prose that tangibly sings with his deep passion for the matter at hand. If you're looking for a different, mindful and powerfully provocative reassessment of Charles Darwin, you could do no better than spend your Christmas money on CHARLES DARWIN: VICTORIAN MYTHMAKER.

Starr Carter has two selves: her ""true"" self in her poor neighborhood and her ""socially accepted"" self in her suburban prep school. Starr has been navigating the balance between these two selves for a years and has got it down pretty well. But when she is the witness to her childhood best friend, who was unarmed, being killed by a police officer, her two lives begin to increasingly intersect, forcing her to reconcile the two into a more coherent and cohesive whole. As people take the life and death of her friend Khalil to further their opinions on and justification for the police officer's actions, Starr decides to speak up with the truth to try and get Khalil the justice he deserves. In speaking up, Starr recognizes that there is a larger effect her words will have on her family and community and weighs the consequences of bringing upheaval to the status quo.

This text educates, emotes, and is simply a powerful work that depicts the harsh, deplorable realities faced by portions of our population. The sense of family conveyed in this novel is remarkable with the unique, though not uncommon, family dynamics of the Carters and how a neighborhood can move beyond a community of peers to behave like a tightly-knit support structure reminiscent of a family. Taking volatile subjects of racism and systematic brutality, this narrative makes them easier to contextualize and comprehend for younger readers, who ought to be educated in these topics to prevent the same issues repeating themselves ad nauseam - it's definitely a good book for students to read and encourage a dialogue about the issues presented within its pages (and in society).

5539,331,1196,"We found this book after some searching because my wife has non specific back pain. With insurance deductibles as high as what they are these days (thanks to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), I am trying to map a plan for her treatment as judiciously as possible because it only takes a very few missteps to waste a lot of money.

Boy am I glad that I found this book!

There is so much information on this topic, it's amazing that the author got in even as much as she did.

The author breaks the book into two parts: 1. Problems. 2. Solutions.

That is not quite the way that the book comes across to me. It's more like:

1. Scope of the problem
2. What *definitely does not work* (i.e., Chiropractic-- If the initial practitioners of chiropractic knew how much fodder they would have provided for later people to blowtorch them with, they would never have started to ply their trade.)
3. What has a shakier track record (Surgery of various types/ Injections, along with detailing the techniques of each type of surgery)
4. Relationship of mental states to back pain. (It's not psychosomatic, but more of it is in a person's head than they might imagine.)
5. What has the best track record (Different types of exercise and methods to improve movement).

There are also quite a few questions around the edges that have tangential relationships.
'
1. What are the misaligned incentives such that surgeons want to do a whole bunch of extra surgeries, even if they have only marginal benefit. (To a hammer, everything looks like a nail.) Could those incentives be made better?
2. What happens when the state is the single provider of medicine? There are a lot more treatments than they can test and sort through and in their question to do less work, they may exclude some very effective treatments.
3. What happens when insurance companies will not pay for something that is a little bit too much to pay for out of pocket but less than what it would cost to take a surgery?

The book itself appears to be four things at once:

1. Medical history
2. Investigative journalism (the author herself goes through many treatments as well as calls to attention exposes of corrupt doctors)
3. A policy book (that asks questions about outcomes under universal health care as well as insurance based systems)
4. Information on success rates of different types of surgery/ procedures (and there are many of them)

I don't know that this is an exhaustive literature survey-- but there are some things that give the reader directions for further study. So, for example, we might want to get a meta analysis of one particular type of surgery to get an idea if *many* surgeries say that it is no more effective than placebo or just the study that Ramin uotes.

The book is well organized (with a good index) and well sourced.

Verdict: Worth the price and worth the time. Even if you have to read the book a second time or go to the medical library to source some of the citations in this book or do secondary research.

It is clear in this account that he was emotionally overwhelmed by WW2 in general and the mass carnage of the Dresden firestorm. It is difficult for him to relate that this raid was a carefully planned action in the rationality of war. Hos experience of the war is that there was no glory and no particular skill. Life and death were products of chance.  Fatalism in the persona of Billy Pilgrim is a clear emotional reaction to this.

5542,712,635,"On the recommendation of a friend I decided to read ""Sabriel,"" the first book of Garth Nix's ""Old Kingdom"" series.  And when I found the audiobook was narrated by none other than Tim Curry, I opted for that over the print version.  I normally prefer print books to audiobooks, but I have enough respect and liking for Tim Curry as an actor that I figured an audiobook narrated by him would be a treat.  I wasn't wrong... but there's far more to enjoy about ""Sabriel"" than its audiobook.  Because it gives us a thrilling and fascinating story, with a wonderful heroine, a unique world and magic system, and a gripping story about the struggle between a divided land and the world of the dead.

The titular Sabriel is a young woman living in one of two kingdoms -- and while her homeland is reminiscent of pre-WWII England, complete with motor vehicles and electric lights, the land beyond the wall belongs to the Old Kingdom, a realm of magic and creatures from the land of the dead.  When a magical construct brings Sabriel the sword and magic bells belonging to her father, a necromancer with the ability to banish the dead from the realm of the living, she realizes something terrible has befallen him, and she sets off on a journey into the Old Kingdom to find out what's become of him.  Joined on the journey by Mogget, a magical creature trapped in the form of a cat, and Touchstone, a young soldier who becomes her bodyguard, she soon uncovers a threat to both kingdoms in the form of a creature of the dead who seeks to release the dead to walk among the living.  Sabriel will need all her skills as a mage, as well as the weapons and wisdom of her father and his necromatic abilities, to save both kingdoms from ruin... but will that be enough?

Garth Nix has created a fascinating world that strikes a nice balance between mundane realism and fantastic magic.  Sabriel's world of an English-style boarding school and modern conveniences and the Old Kingdom with its charms, spells, and wards against the walking dead fit together remarkably well, complementing one another rather than clashing.  And the magic system -- one where some magic is kept in check with a Charter and with specific marks and runes, while other magic is Free and wild and quite dangerous -- felt logical and believable, mostly sticking to its rules instead of being a handy Deus Ex Machina to solve problems effortlessly.

The characters are fascinating as well.  Female characters tend to be problematic, especially when written by male writers, but Garth Nix does well with his heroine, making her strong and independent without making her unlikable or completely unfeminine.  She has her doubts and her flaws, and makes mistakes, but at the same time she handles herself remarkably well, and isn't above finding humor in her situation.  I enjoyed reading about her allies as well -- Mogget is a snarky voice of reason, and Touchstone is a complex character in his own right.  I saw the inevitable romantic tension between these two coming a mile away, but at least the writer doesn't let it hijack the story -- it's present, but never to such a degree that it turns an interesting fantasy adventure into another maudlin YA romance.

A word on the audiobook -- Tim Curry's narration is fantastic, and I enjoyed his voice throughout.  He has distinctive voices for each character, and I especially loved his rendition of Mogget.  Touchstone's voice seems a little unfitting for his character, but that's my sole complaint on the audio version.

""Sabriel"" is a unique and enjoyable fantasy, and it's made me curious about the workings of the Old Kingdom and its magic system.  I plan on following this series further, and hope to see more of Sabriel and her companions in future volumes.",1515369600,5

This is a feel good read. Not a heavy-issue, dramatic read but a good light, fun romance. Take it to the beach or give it to a tween or teen who is on spring break. It was everything I expected and I loved it.",1515369600,5
5546,590,5,"I listened to Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine on audio and the narrator, Cathleen McCarron, was a perfect match for Eleanor and her escapades. She does beautiful things with the words and I could listen to her accent all day. If you're an audio fan snap this one up!

Eleanor is a quirky lady. She lives a solitary life and follows the same routine day after day, week after week, and year after year. She goes to work, she comes home. She is blunt and says whatever comes to mind. Maybe because of this, she has no friends. She does not socialize. On Wednesday she receives her toxic phone call from Mummy which always leaves her feeling worse for it. And on Friday she gets takeout and 3 bottles of booze to help her get through the long, lonely stretch of the weekend.

Then one day she has to call IT because her computer isn't working properly and she meets Raymond. Now don't worry its not what you're thinking. This is not a romance and he is not there to sweep her off her feet and make everything all better with his dashing looks and wit. Hes disheveled, hes average in looks but hes friendly and, after they save an old man in the street, they become the most unlikeliest of friends and Eleanors social world expands just a little. Raymond doesnt care that Eleanor is strange and blunt. He enjoys her company and she, much to her surprise, allows herself to enjoy his. But Eleanor has some deep dark painful things she must deal with before she is able to fully engage in the world.

Im not going to spoil another thing. Just go read this if you haven't already. Its ugly, its wickedly funny but never frivolous, its painful and sensitive and its such a lovely way to spend a few hours. Itll leave you feeling a little better about the world when youve finished and who doesnt want that?!",1515369600,5
5547,117,108,"I read this novel when I was studying American literature at my University and immediately fell in love with F.S. Fitzgeralds writing. The Great Gatsby is familiar to many of us from the movie based on it, but one should really read the book to get a full grasp of the story, even though its one of those rare occasions where the movie was just as good as the novel itself. But the beautiful language, the allegories, the symbolism that Fitzgerald is using can only be enjoyed through the written word, and I highly recommend everyone reading this beautiful novel that is rightfully considered classic.
The parallels between the self-made man Gatsby, who is still a hopeless romantic, a dreamer deep down in his soul, and the clan of the Buchanans, which represents the concept of old money in this novel, are drawn with ruthless precision. Their soulless, consuming nature, their disregard for everything and everyone masterfully concealed by the polished attitude and the carefully created aristocratic image is opposed by the tender and dreamy nature of Gatsby, whose only dream was to reunite with the woman he loved, and because of whom he amassed such a fortune. Unlike the Buchanans, hes not interested in money for the sake of money; for him, its only the means of reaching his dream, and eventually, he pays the highest price for that dream of his.
An absolutely fascinating, tragic story of a rotten society that I would highly recommend to everyone. Truly outstanding work.",1515369600,5

The classic theme of secrets and lies expands here into an examination of what we know about each other and how our past affects our present.

5551,647,468,"I absolutely loved The Martian so of course Artemis went straight to the top of my wish list the minute I heard about it. I'll tell you upfront that this is very different to Andy Weir's first story but it was still a great read that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Jazz is a criminal who makes her money smuggling contraband into Artemis, the first city built on the moon. She's not the biggest crime lord on the block but she's fiercely independent and smart enough to work the system in her own favour. When she's offered the chance to cash in on the job of a lifetime she jumps at it thinking she'll finally have enough money to start living the high life that Artemis is so well known for but it doesn't take long before things go horribly wrong when her contact is murdered. She soon finds herself in the middle of a war, caught between the mob on one side and the police on the other. Her only chance of survival is pulling of a heist that is so tricky it's just as likely to be the death of her rather than the salvation she desperately needs.

Artemis is such a fun read, very fast paced and full of action it was hard to put down once I'd started reading. I loved Jazz, she was snarky and sarcastic, a little too mouthy for her own good and very sure of herself but she has the skills to back up her confidence and I enjoyed seeing her work out how to achieve her goals. This story was a lot lighter than The Martian and a very different tone but Andy Weir still excels at making science interesting and including all sorts of fascinating information in his stories that just make his worlds feel even more believable. We have a larger cast of characters here and they all had their own personality quirks and added something unique to the story.

Although this story works perfectly as a stand alone I can't help hoping that the author will revisit this world again in the future, I'd definitely be happy to see this turned into a series. Either way Andy Weir has earned a spot on my auto buy authors list and I'm looking forward to seeing where his imagination will take us next.",1515369600,4
5552,20,819,"This book lived up to all the hype and I am so happy about it. A huge thanks goes out to William Morrow Publishing for my review copy.

I always get nervous diving into books that I have heard so many wonderful comments about because I never want to be disappointed, but this one does not disappoint!

Anna Fox has not left home in over 10 months and has a strange hobby of watching her neighbors. One night she sees something that sets up a disastrous chain of events. What will end up happening now that she has seen something that she shouldn't have?

I loved the writing in this book. One of my favorite parts is how Anna's personal life story is told in bits and pieces throughout the whole book. This leaves you having so many questions about the main character and finding out more and more as the story continues on. This book is full of exciting moments and chapter endings that leave you hanging.

If you haven't already picked this one up I would definitely recommend it. The short chapters and quick pace of the story make for an easy read despite the 400+ page length.",1515369600,4
5553,16,819,"Okay, this is one of the best twisty, turny psychological thrillers I've read in a long, long time. You have got to read The Woman in the Window, the debut novel from A.J. Finn.

Anna Fox is agoraphobic, unable to leave her home. She mixes alcohol with her medication and spends her days looking out her windows at her neighbourhood. Well, no that's not quite right......she spies on them, taking pictures with her camera. A new family moves in and Anna starts watching them as well. And then she sees something she shouldn't have. Or did she?

Finn has created a fantastically unreliable narrator in Anna. Can we believe what she is seeing? Saying? Her reasoning is flawed and her take on things is skewed. Or is it? The supporting cast is just as unreliable. It seems everyone has their own agenda, secrets and lies. Finn deliciously unspools his story, letting us see a little more with each new chapter.

Anna has a fondness for old black and white films, especially those by Alfred Hitchcock. Those familiar with his work (and especially Rear Window) will appreciate the references and the homage.

I am being deliberately obtuse. I don't want to reveal too much - this is a tale you need to experience. To wonder how and why, to 'ah hahing' at each new reveal and revelation, to trying to puzzle out the final whodunit. Which will be impossible as Finn has written a labyrinth of a novel. And one that is very, very hard to put down. I absolutely loved it!",1515369600,5
5554,711,819,"A. J. Finns debut novel begins with an ominous epigram: I have a feeling that inside you somewhere, theres something nobody knows about. This is a line from the 1943 classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller, Shadow of a Doubt, and THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, in more ways than one, pays homage to the venerable master of suspense.

Anna Fox is a recently separated woman living alone in her restored Harlem brownstone. She used to have a thriving child psychology practice until a year or so ago, but now is a confirmed agoraphobic, petrified to go outside or let the outside world come in, aside from the rare exceptions of her soon-to-be ex-husband, Ed; her eight-year-old daughter, Olivia; and her tenant, Dave, who occupies the basement apartment. She spends her days counseling other agoraphobics online, watching old black and white movies, and drinking wine. Hers is a small, highly ordered life. Until the Russells move in.

Anna watches as this new family moves into the brownstone across the way: a busy husband, an attractive wife and their teenage son. Observing this family makes Anna pine for her own. Ed and Olivia moved out about a year ago. One night, Anna witnesses what seems to be the aftermath of a violent attack over at the Russells place. Did she really just see what she thinks she did? Is she in danger? Very quickly, her ordered world completely crumbles underneath her.

The tricky part about writing a review for a novel like THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is trying not to reveal too much, in order to let the reader enjoy all the twists and turns themselves, with no spoilers. Finn captures his audience from the first sentence and doesnt let go until hes finished his winding tale of suspense that will ensnare avid readers of Patricia Highsmith, Tana French and Gillian Flynn, and, most certainly, Alfred Hitchcock fans. But in addition to the carefully plotted suspense, Finn makes you genuinely feel for the characters. Despite her complicated problems, Anna is quite likable. You root for her and desperately hope that she can overcome her paralyzing phobia and debilitating drinking problem, and put her life back together. You also feel for Ed and Olivia, and understand where they're coming from. These are relatable characters placed in an unimaginably horrific situation.

So dear reader, please forgive this briefer than usual review. There are only so many ways to say that this novel is a terrific, riveting psychological thriller without giving anything away. You should read it immediately. Dont believe me? Well then, how about the ringing endorsements from Stephen King, Gillian Flynn and Tess Gerritsen? Or the fact that Fox 2000 has already purchased the film rights, paying over one million dollars? (At the time of this writing, Tracy Letts is attached to adapt and Scott Rudin to produce for the studio.) If thats not enough to pique your interest, I cant imagine anything will.

5558,275,1728,"Sunday Silence by Nicci French is an intriguing and fast paced mystery. Although this newest release is the seventh installment in the Frieda Klein series, it works well as a standalone.

Psychotherapist and occasional police consultant Frieda Klein is very upset to discover the mutilated corpse of Bruce Stringer, the private detective she hired, under the floorboards in her home. She suspects the killer is Dean Reeve, who is a presumed dead serial killer. With her friend DCI Malcolm Karlsson on leave with an injury, Frieda must convince Chief Inspector Petra Burge that Reeve is not only alive, but responsible for Stringers death. Six months later, the case is cold, and Friedas family and friends are being targeted for random acts of violence and the police are forced to admit Reeve is still alive. But Frieda soon believes that someone other than Reeve is responsible for these recent attacks.  With the media hounding her, Frieda agrees to an interview with reporter Daniel Blackstock in hopes of flushing out the elusive killer.

Frieda is very cool and reserved under pressure which leads people to believe that she is not distressed by the recent events. When her friends and family are in danger, her concern for their safety leads  her to make a very out of character decision to try to keep them safe. Despite having mixed feelings about this choice and fearing she has made a big mistake, Frieda nonetheless presses on in her attempt to find the person responsible for harming her loved ones. With often nebulous impressions that are hard to explain to the police working the case, Frieda concentrates on finding the link between her and the person who is using her family to rattle her. Certain she has zeroed in the right suspect, Frieda is soon in a race against time to locate the most recent victim before it is too late.

Sunday Silence is an engrossing and suspense laden mystery with a clever storyline. With plenty of twists and turns, Nicci French pits Frieda against a formidable foe who is convinced no one will figure out their devious plan. With most of the loose ends completely wrapped up, the novel ends with a stunning cliffhanger that will leave readers desperately awaiting the next installment in the Frieda Klein series.

5559,119,334,"Well dang, that book gave me whiplash!! What a crazy read. For whatever reason, I was totally expecting to hate this book. Ive seen some pretty hot and cold reviews and since my opinions seem to usually be of the unpopular variety, I thought Id dislike this one for sure. Even though I can definitely see why this book annoyed some people, I was freaking entertained by it!

THE REHASH
In the world of Mare Barrow, the basis of life boils down to the most basic thingblood. Normal humans like you, me, and Mare are called Reds for our red blood. Those with silver blood, or Silvers, are gifted with special abilities and held in a high regard. The Silvers are given all the money, power, fame, and opportunity while reds are left to fend for themselves. Most Reds are forced to serve Silvers just to make enough to get by. Any Red that doesnt have a job or purpose is forced into conscription, serving the military in a war thats been dragging on for generations.

Seventeen year-old Mare isn't good at anything except stealing, swiping things for her family to get by until shes forced to conscript the following year. One day, a group called the Scarlet Guard make themselves known and try to start a Red revolution. By happenstance, Mare gets caught up in one of their attacks and her world is thrown into chaos. She meets someone that entangles her in the Silver royal family, changing her life and forcing her to question everything shes ever known. As she gets closer and closer to the Silver royals while simultaneously watching the Scarlet Guard start a revolution, Mare must decide where her loyalties really lie.

THE UGLY
Oh man, where do I start? This book is so dramatic! There were so many tropes and clichs, it almost made me laugh. First of all, the whole dystopian government-is-selfishly-corrupt thing is basically its own trope now isn't it? Why hellooooooo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hunger-Games/dp/0439023483/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hunger Games</a>, long time no see. In the beginning when Mare goes on and on about the suppression of Reds and how Silvers get all the wealth and power, I thought ""here we go again""

Then OF COURSE she turns out to be the chosen one, with a unique ability that no else has and ITS UP TO HER TO SAVE THE KINGDOM!! A Red with the powers of a Silver?!? GASP!! Mare was plain, boring, and normal, but NOW shes special and coveted by all!!

And then, theres a weird love triangle between Mare and the two princes. The two princes! BECAUSE SHES JUST SO UNIQUE AND SPECIAL AND DIFFERENT.

Sorry, Ill try to reign in the sarcasm. Apparently Im feeling a little sassy today. But sometimes it was all just a little too much. I adore young-adult books, but this one felt especially teenager-y to me. There were several big moments that I think were suppose to be shocking, but I was shocked by none of them. Everything was pretty predictable and I saw the twist ending coming for MILES. It was so NOT surprising to me, I couldn't believe Mare WAS surprised.

THE GOOD
Despite ALL of this, I strangely found myself liking this book??? I enjoyed it in the same way I enjoyed the Selection series, like a soap opera or terrible reality TV.

Even I don't completely understand it, but all the drama was extremely entertaining. Mare has a great sense of humor that I loved and watching her lightning abilities develop was pretty fun. And despite the clich-ness of it all, I couldn't help but fall for Maven and Cal just as much as Mare did. And Julian was the best!! He was like the Yoda of Red Queen and I don't understand why Mare didn't listen to him more. My man Julian knows whats up.

FINAL WORD
Meh. Im torn in half about this one. If you're a fan of drama and terrible television, then say I say go for it. This book was good for some entertainment, but it wasn't really anything new.",1515456000,4
5560,477,1697,"OMG. Everless by Sara Holland is a sinfully delightful read! I got this book last night and already finished it. You could stay that time flew by reading this book. A recommended read. This book is a strong showing for a debut author as well as a first book in this series. I can't wait for book two. This book kind of reminded me of the movie, In Time with Justin Timberlake.  In where people use time as currency and once you are out of time, you die. The wealthy have tons of time and the poor are hurting for time. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to give anything away. Yet, if you are familiar with the movie then you will catch my drift.

Jules does not start out as a strong persona but by the end of this book she is turning into a leader. I can't wait to see her growth in the next book. She will be a force to be reckoned with. Also, I like that the romance was light and not really a prominent part of the story. Yet, there is a romance brewing that I am intrigued to see where it goes if anywhere. Everless is a book that you don't want to miss!

5561,319,1023,"I loved the novel Pupcakes by Annie England Noblin.  It has everything I enjoy is a modern womans story, a woman whose life has experienced a setback that needs to start over.  She learns to have a new life, meets new friends, starts a new romantic relationship, and tasty food is involved in her future career.  Pupcakes also added a dog to this good book recipe.

Byrdie Benson has recently gotten divorced from her baker husband when she caught him baking with an employee.  They sold the bakery they owned together and Byrdie has moved to Memphis with her best friend, Elliot and her family.  Elliot hooks her up with a new gig, housesitting for an elderly ladys townhouse and dog, while she is in a retirement community.  Pauline may be gone, but she is not forgotten as Byrdie must visit her once a week with Paulines pug Teddy Roosevelt.  Byrdie also gets a 3rd shift job at the bakery inside of ShopCo.  She also meets handsome doctor Nathan Reid at the dog park while on a walk with Teddy.  Can these two make it work in a new relationship?  Why is Paulines basement locked?  What secrets does she not want Byrdie to find?  Will Byrdie be able to get her career back on track?

Favorite Quotes:

The dog came with the house.  Or maybe the house came with the dog.  Either way, no matter how the sentence was constructed, the house and the dog came together. 

Youll love him, her mother went on, ignoring her.  Hes good looking, owns his own home, and has all of his own teeth and hair.  What more could you ask for?

Overall, Pupcakes was a great delight.  I thought the characters were riveting and very well developed.  I wanted to sit at Thanksgiving dinner with all of them.  I loved Byrdies character growth throughout the novel.  I always think a good book is able to showcase characters that we relate to and emphasize with through the high and lows of life.  Pupcakes does this perfectly.  I highly recommend it!

5563,929,1729,"This is a very challenging read and doesn't give women an easy life nor happiness. From a farm couple who despise each other in the Ohio black swamp country, visited only by Johnny Appleseed selling his apple seedlings, having a child a year whether they survive the swamp fevers or not, we move through a violent affray to the contrast of the California redwood groves.

The men are the major figures and trees the major theme. We see how hard and bad life was, so that an apple orchard could produce fruit for eating but cider is preferred by some, just as an escape from reality. We also see a little of the California gold rush. Some adult scenes are included and some strong language.

I really thought that a woman could always find work, cooking and cleaning, so the couple should have split up; but in those days a bad marriage was a penance that had to be endured I suppose. Read this book along with 'More Work For Mother', a factual look at the history of housework in America for an interesting study. As a tree lover I enjoyed looking at tree planting, husbandry and collecting.
This is an unbiased review.",1515456000,5
5564,763,723,"I expected greatness out of Ship of Magic, especially since I devoured both The Farseer Trilogy and The Soldier Son Trilogy. Also, Robin Hobb is one of my favorite writers, so the bar is always high for me when it comes to her books. Unfortunately, for the first time I came away disappointed.

Hobb's greatest strength is twofold: her characterizations and her world-building. She has a knack for creating believable, likeable, even detestable characters. Also, the settings she creates are top-notch: well thought out, realistic, and most definitely populated by 'believable' characters.

Ship of Magic does not falter in these areas. But ultimately it did fail to present to me a character which I could readily identify with. Therein lies the true strength of The Farseer and Soldier Son trilogies. Both have strong yet flawed and very sympathetic characters. Ship of Magic has Althea, who fits this bill to some extent, but because there are so many other characters and other plotlines, she gets lost amidst the clutter.

Which brings me to my second contention with Ship of Magic: it's just too darn long. Standing in at a hefty 800 pages, this monster of a book is, in my opinion, about 400 pages too long. I've given up such weighty (no pun intended) series like George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire for wasting my time with books that go nowhere. While Hobb's pace moves along well enough, I still felt it suffered from bloat.

My last issue with Ship of Magic has to do with the characters, or rather my dislike of most of them. Kyle Haven is an ass. Wintrow is an unlikable wuss. Malta is useless.

Althea, already mentioned, stands out amongst these less than likable personas. Brashen, also, as a well thought out character whom I found myself genuinely rooting for.

At this point, I don't know if I want to invest the same amount of time in books two and three if book one is any indication of things to come. I don't know if either gets any better or worse in terms of page count. Also, as engaging as some (OK, two) of the characters are, the story lags. There's just not enough going on. It's mostly this trader family does this and the other one does that. The great thing about The Farseer Trilogy is that it has all the great characters but also an overlying mysterywhat are the Outislanders doing to the people of the Six Duchies to turn them into such monsters and how are they going to stop the invasion? It's a strange happening that kept me reading on and on.

Ship of Magic just didn't have this same attraction.",1515456000,2

5568,650,1680,"It's Percy but not Percy at the same time, and that is messing with my mind a bit.

To be honest, I don't know much about this series. When I started this book, I knew there was going to be new characters and some Percy/Annabeth pop-ups, and that was it. I figured, that sounds like epicness, so I'm going to go with it. If you are a follower of my blog, you may know I have exceedingly high expectations of stuff, but when it comes to these books, I literally throw them right out the window and just go for the ride.

First and foremost, I must proclaim my love right now for two characters. Leo is literally one of my favorite characters ever and he must be protected at all costs BECAUSE HE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, KK???? Omigosh, he is funny and sweet and I love him dearly and I just want to have him in my life...which brings me to my second favorite character ever which was Coach Hedge. Omigosh, I feel like he walked out of my imagination and went straight onto the page. He's absolutely hilarious between fleeing everything for some grass or wanting to beat up everything. I HAVE NEVER LOVED A GOAT MAN MORE (so, so, sorry, Grover, you still have my heart BUT COACH HEDGE JUST STOLE IT AND TOOK IT FOR HIS OWN). I love outlandish hilarious characters, and these two men just about made me swoon. SO. MANY. HEART. EYES. Maybe I will stop fangirling by the time this is posted but seeing as I have four more books of these that THEY BETTER BE IN OR ELSE I WILL RIOT not sure how this is going to go.

The rest of the characters were intriguing in the way that I was kind of eh about them. I liked Jason and Piper well enough, but to be honest, I never really super felt for them. I felt like I was going through the motions with Piper, but I did love her transformation and her taking over her own empowerment. Jason was...well, he was just cookie cutter action hero at times for me - which meant I liked him but it was kind of all surface level. I never fell for him like I did for Leo who had emotional depth and quirks in his personality. Maybe it's because he had amnesia for the entire book? And I was still feeling Piper out?

As for our previous loves, OF COURSE MY NON-FAVORITE DEMIGOD THALIA HAD TO SHOW UP. UGH. But Annabeth was there, and I really really enjoyed her in this one. Same goes for Chiron and Rachel (who was my main previous love in the first series). I'm intrigued to see how else he will interweave the old and new together.

The plot was super interesting. At times, it did feel like it was dragging out a bit too long, but it really was moving quite along in a good pace. At times I got a little confused with the world building in this one, but by the end, I did have it all figured out for the most part. I totally need to brush up on my Roman mythology, though, because I was failing so hard. This story is not as easy of a dive as Percy Jackson was, which I did struggle with a bit. But the ease of the writing and moving from place to place was still quality Riordan.

Overall, this was a good start to the series. I'm so intrigued to see where this is going to go. Riordan has a good set up, and while I'm still a tad shaky on the mythology and some of the new characters, I have two bright and burning new loves that has me SO SO eager to dive into the rest of this series. LEO AND COACH HEDGE, I AM COMING FOR YOU. 4 crowns and an Ariel rating!",1515456000,4
5569,119,437,"Ohhhhhhh man. THIS book. It took me months to finish this. MONTHS. After falling deeply in love with An Ember in the Ashes, I immediately started on the second one, hungry for more Elias and Laia. Once I got through the first several chapters, however, I thought I knew exactly where this book was headed and I was not of fan. Some hardcore procrastination happened in a flimsy effort to prolong my time with my two favorite characters.

All I can say is, BOY WAS I WRONG. Thats what I get for thinking I know everything. By the time I reached the last page, I was kicking myself for putting this off for as long as I did. I will never doubt Sabaa Tahir again.

THE REHASH
When we last saw Elias and Laia, they were running for their lives away from Blackcliff Academy (and the Commandant. Ugh) and this book picks up right where we left off. Laia desperately needs help finding and breaking in to Kauf prison where her brother is being kept, and Elias readily agrees to team up. After spending his life around so much death and oppression, its his way of giving back and helping a greater good. Things are going swimminglyat least, for two fugitives on the runwhen the Commandant happens and throws a giant hitch in their plans. I know, its totally unlike her *she said with bitter sarcasm*

Meanwhile, the two creeper twins Marcus and the Commandant are busy slaughtering innocent people and generally ruining everyones lives. Poor Helene is trapped as the new Blood Shrike and doing whatever Marcus tells her toa horrifying thought. After the humiliating destruction Elias and Laia caused in their departure, Marcus and the Commandant are eager for blood and send Helene to apprehend her best friend and boy crush Elias. Because after all, if anyone could find him its her. With a heavy heart, Helene scours the countryside looking for Elias and gets hot on his trail.

Laia and Elias face setback after setback after setback and begin to doubt if theyll ever make it to Kauf. They don't even know if Laias brother will be alive by the time they reach it. But with the help of some new (and old) friends, the two FINALLY make it to Kauf prison.

And so does Helene Dun dun DUNNNNNN!!!

THE GOOD
Both the beginning and ending of this book DEFINITELY kept me on my toes. So much happens in such a short period of time! At least it felt that way. Read one page and youve already gone through two fight scenes and an angsty almost-kiss. But what really kept me going were the great characters. I LOVE LAIA AND ELIAS SO MUCH!! Laia somehow manages to be both strong and vulnerable in the best way and theres a humility about her that gives me all the feels. And Elias has had some serious bad luck, but uses his remorse as a motivator to be a better person. He has such a big heart and Im so glad I can count him among my fictional husbands. Plus, the new characters we see in this book are great! Afya Ara-Nur IS MY GIRL and I love her sassy honesty.

Its also worth mentioning again how awesome this universe is. I really love the strong roman vibes I get from this book because it feels so different from anything Ive read. Every time Tahir describes the landscape and I get to compare it to the map, it gives me a little thrill.

Plus, theres a WHOPPER of a twist at the end that I did not see coming at all. I had a few suspicions on what was going to happen, which is how I ended up reading this book for FOUR months, but I was definitely not even close.

THE UGLY
Okay, I admit it. Helene bothered me a little this time around. She bothered me a tad in the first one when she'd go on rants about how amazing the Empire is or how scholars deserve to be treated terribly. But then Elias lead her on the ENTIRE book only to ditch her at the very end, so I felt for Heleneespecially because she got stuck with the creeper Marcus. UGH. At the end of this second book, however, something happens that she acts completely shocked about that I didn't find surprising in the least. I won't give anything away, but dang did it frustrate me at the end!!!

And I will say that I got a tad bored in the middle. Maybe bored is the wrong word because there was always something happening, but it definitely dragged on a little. I hated the parts with Laia and Ian together. I just wanted the story to GET ON WITH IT. That could be my frustration talking though because GRRR @ IANS ENTIRE CHARACTER.

FINAL WORD
Was this sequel as good at the first? No, I don't think so, but it was still an amazing book and I highly recommend this series! Cant wait to get my hands on A Reaper at the Gates!!!!",1515456000,4
5570,919,1632,I'm becoming a big Neil Gaiman fan and I've only read two books by him so far. This is a great retelling of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty merged together. Oh and the art is amazing!,1515456000,4
5571,29,1632,"I ADORED this book! Gaiman weaves together the stories of Snow White after she defeats her stepmother and Sleeping Beauty, who is still under the sleeping curse.

First, I love fairy tale retellings and I love that we get a 2-for-1 with this one. Its great that Gaiman continues Snow Whites story by having her enter into Sleeping Beautys. Second, the illustrations are absolutely gorgeous. Riddell has outdone himself with this one  its beautifully illustrated.

Its hard to tell what I liked so much about it without giving spoilers, but its brilliant. There are nice elements of feminism and coming-of-age, with Snow White questioning what she actually wants from her life and what shed like to do in the future. Is her happily ever after really getting married? These doubts are what motivate her to go out to break the sleeping curse that has been rapidly spreading from Sleeping Beautys kingdom and might encroach upon her own.

If you're a fairy tale fan, read this. If you like good stories, read this. Its short, beautiful, and just a wonderful story. I love it so much and cant wait to buy my own copy.",1515456000,5
5572,620,1730,"One of my favorite authors and she did not disappoint with this contemporary story that enchanted with the wonderful ways in which she described the setting and the many foods and meals that Annie Rush creates. In this story, Annie suffers a devastating injury after surprising her husband, a TV chef, when she rushes to the set to tell him they are pregnant. In the course of the time she loses in a deep coma, we learn much of her backstory and that of her high school sweetheart, the new guy, Fletcher, who looks rough around the edges when he and his dad first move into town to take over the local garage. How he becomes an attorney and why makes of an intriguing second story line and made me want to find someone as wonderful as Fletcher, who also suffers not only from Annie's leave-taking to go to California but also a divorce from one of the cheerleaders each knew in high school.

How Annie fares during and after the coma is truly affecting and pulled me in completely. At times, I felt I was right there with her, unable to wake, wanting to, feeling too weak even to raise a hand, much less an arm, and then struggling with her after she wakes up to put together the flashes of memory that gradually come back to her. But where is that baby she was pregnant with? Late in the story, we learn--along with her--what happened after her head injury.

When a third opportunity to take back her former life is placed in front of her, Annie must not only confront her ex-husband, but also the woman she caught him with, and what she really wants out of life--that elusive career opportunity in California, or a life with Fletcher, his son, and the rest of her family in Vermont. The name of the town acts as a continual reminder of what Annie does. An affecting story, one that I'll definitely read again and again.",1515456000,5
5573,946,833,"I finally got a chance to finish reading Chasing Christmas Eve by Jill Shalvis, which happens to be the fourth book in the Heartbreaker Bay series. I wanted to finish reading it before 2018, but family was in town, so it was left on my nightstand until I could finish it. Im thankful for my family letting me finish it the first weekend of 2018 without any interruptions. Maybe there was one interruption, but all I had to do was the evil stare and they left me be to finish enjoying Spences and Colbies book.

I was happy that Spence got his HEA in Chasing Christmas Eve and I also was happy he found a girl with similarities like him. Colbie and Spence definitely know how to not have a love life, when they work all the time or take others more than themselves.

Colbie has to get away from her family that is dependent on her, so she can finally get back to enjoying her job as a writer. She has a book to write, so she decides to run away from New York and head somewhere else. Her original destination doesnt happen, so she ends up in San Francisco. Her first day there, she ends up in the fountain soaking wet by a dog that put her in there. She ends up also meeting Spence who happens to be dreamy and is the one walking the dog. Shes supposed to be there to get away from it all, but ends up meeting the one guy that brings out a spark in her that she didn't know she had.

Spence is the rich inventor guy of his group of crazy lovable friends. Hes unfortunately in the spotlight thanks to so-called friend putting him out there in the press and now all the ladies want to be with him. Hes a rich, good-looking, very successful guy, so girls are definitely wanting to be with him, but hes not trying to be with them. He never though he would meet the girl that changed his view of life, until he meets Colbie. He also starts realizing it acts like someone his family, hes trying to end up like.

Jill Shalvis definitely wrote an interesting story with these two. Spence who happens to be a workaholic ends up becoming different in the story due to Colbie. Lets not forget Spences friends are very protective, especially Elle. If you didn't read the previous book of this series then its a must because youll understand why Elle is protective of her friends. One thing I enjoyed about Colbie is how quirky she was and how she didn't curse at all. She always had something cute and funny to say, instead of cursing.

I really enjoyed Spence and Colbie, but I definitely was upset with how these two handled certain situations with each other. There were times I wanted to knock some sense in both of them. I did enjoy the ending with these two and like I said before Im so glad Spence got his HEA. I also loved Colbies character because she definitely fit well with Spence and his friends.

I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to Contemporary Romance readers out there. The Heartbreaker Bay series has definitely become a favorite of mine and Im actually diving into the next book soon.",1515456000,4
5574,670,1731,This is a very young bio of Mae Jemison. Short sentences and limited text with a page-long note on her life at the back. The illustrations are gorgeous--I love the artwork style. The story is a sweet introduction to astronauts in general and Mae in particular. I hate that her teacher discouraged her but I like that the parents tell her to keep dreaming. Great message. Love.,1515456000,5
5575,29,273,"*I received a free copy of this book from the publisher through a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review.*

The premise of this story is fascinating  a young Iranian-American girl prides herself on being authentic learns that shes actually adopted, pushing her into a spiraling identity crisis. This all ties into a genealogy project shes doing for school, and comes at a time when there are tense times between her and her friends, so shes left feeling completely alone and lost.

I love that big publishing is starting to branch out to cover more diverse voices, giving readers a chance to find themselves in stories that feel true to their experiences. Daria is a great YA main character who simultaneously loves her family and is completely annoyed by them. She has a great group of friends who have different personalities and share inside jokes with one another all the time. And her parents, while maybe a bit out-of-touch are actually cool and responsible. Every character in this book has flaws but is still likeable, which I really appreciated. Nazemian does a great job in giving his characters a complexity that drew me into their stories.

There were some plot points that seemed incredibly coincidental and random, and therefore not believable. The way Daria found her birth mom left me with a lot of questions, but the story overall is fantastic. It touches on themes of friendship, identity, individuality, and family, of course. It especially looks at what exactly a family is made of and who can truly be considered family. Daria is smart, funny, and sometimes moody. Her journey to discover her true identity and figure out who she is will resonate with young and old readers alike. I definitely recommend you put this book on your shelf.",1515456000,4
5576,962,1732,"A failure in business, needing to provide for his wife, he was encouraged by Mark Twain, among others, to write his memoirs.  And he finished it just before he died.  And to that, one has to say THANK YOU.  The book was sold in advance by subscription, with salesmen going to houses displaying the American flag, since that often meant a Civil War veteran probably lived there.  His style of writing is clear, concise and readable.  One gets a real understanding of war.  A line that really sticks with me was when he told his troops that the enemy is as afraid of you as you are of them.  He covers all his campaigns in a way that allows the reader to see the larger picture.  Some of his battles were of great carnage, but he did not revel in carnage.  That is what war is about, especially then.  Pair this with Ron Chernow's book on Grant, and one gets a complete picture.  A regret I have, and perhaps he didn't want to make note of it, but he accepted the terrible conditions of the prisoner of war camps in the South, abandoning the practice of amnesty, as a way to deprive the South of manpower.  Up until then, prisoners were paroled, to go back to their homes and never raise a weapon again.  Grant wanted the South to lose even that portion of manpower that could be used in factories and farms to aid the South.  Chernow's book doesn't touch on this either.",1515456000,5

5578,538,1704,"I have a healthy skepticism about paranormal, spiritual, whatever you want to call it events, so I went into this book with my usual Yeah, right attitude.  By the end of it, I was ready to call a psychically inclined friend and ask her to do a walk-thru of my apartment...just in case.  The sheer amount of evidence and incredible details of events in this book have made me pause and reconsider my stance on such things.",1515456000,4
5579,50,1733,"This was an excellent book and very interesting.  It begins before WW1 in Europe where we are introduced to two families.  One a wealthy family in the west and the other a poor family across the Atlantic in Eastern Europe who takes in an orphan.  The orphan and the son of the wealthy family in America are the main subjects of this story that takes you from their childhood to their birth and connects them.  I was wishing for a different end, but it was not to be.  However, the ending is still very good and this is first in a series.  In this installment it follows the lives of these young men who come from very different circumstances but connect.  The connection is not a good one as the the immigrant infers something that is false and makes it a goal to ruin Kane.",1515456000,5
5580,527,770,"In an ever-increasing list of books I failed to read as a child, I finally managed to get to Watership Down. While I am aware that many people speculate the true meaning of the book to be an allegory for Nazis or Communism, or whatever, the prologue provided by the author in this edition stated that it was merely a bedtime story for his children. With this in mind, Im sure many subconscious influences led to some of the themes in Watership Down. Either way, the story seemed to be a rambling series of events that didn't have much of a point or purpose.

Lets be clear: I like rabbits. I think they're cute, and I even own two of them. Therefore, I appreciate the little details of lagomorph mannerisms sprinkled throughout. And yet, there were a few confusing choices made in this book, like giving a somewhat-confusing rabbit language that rarely had context, and was mostly abandoned by the end of the book. I also couldn't buy into the idea of a rabbit army since most of the rabbits Ive seen in the wild have been mostly solitary animals, and hardly in the numbers described in Watership Down.

When it comes right down to it, the thing that perhaps disturbed me the most about this book was the anthropomorphism of the rabbits. Sure, the side stories about El-Ahrairah were distracting and often unnecessary, and I couldn't honestly tell you the character traits or attributes of any of the numerous rabbits, but the fact that they could talk to each other made them seem somewhat human. Consequently, this then introduces ideas like war and sex trafficking via the innocent covering of rabbits. I feel these tend to be mostly human traits, so it pulled me from the story when I had to remind myself, Wait, these are rabbits.

A meandering story that puts humans in rabbit bodies, I give Watership Down 2.5 stars out of 5.",1515542400,3
5581,48,464,Great read!,1515542400,5
5582,1002,26,"This book was not what I expected. I didn't read anything about it before jumping in and based on the title, I thought it would be an ED book, which I am endlessly intrigued by. It is quite the opposite in many ways. I was hooked, though. It is, by nature of the chapter length, a quick read, but I was also looking forward to my free time when I could dive in again.

Towards the middle of the book I started to get really annoyed with Roxane. She seemed to whine a lot and put words in other people's mouth based on her own insecurities. It almost seemed like she was judging them and their reactions, facial expressions, etc. more than they were probably judging her. This led me, however, to reexamine myself. Because A) I do the same thing when someone gives me the side eye at the gym and B) this is her story, her voice, her thoughts, her experience and her life. It doesn't matter if I think she's being irrational. This is how she lives her life and someone would probably say the same about how I talk about my life.

Overall it was an excellent book. It made me look at myself and my biases and rethink my thoughts and actions. I like how at the end she mentions that she is more easily able to empathize with those who have disabilities because of her size. This may have been where I felt justified, so to speak, because I have a sister with a physical disability that makes me more accepting, thoughtful, and makes me look at the world a little differently. I am not necessarily the ""norm"" in which she is referencing in her memoir. While I still need to continually check my privilege and bias, I am, hopefully at least, a little further along than the jerks she has encountered, because a lot of them really are awful.

I would definitely pick up this book again and will recommend it to those I encounter. It was wonderful.",1515542400,4
5583,432,1327,"Hadley McCauley is under constant scrutiny by her father, despite fulfilling his every wish for her present life and her future.  With a sincere desire to keep her little sister from her father's strict control, Hadley has toed the line for years.  When she starts a relationship with fellow student Charlie Simmons, regardless of the fact that dating is forbidden, Hadley's view of life is opened to new possibilities.  Will Hadley's secret home life be exposed after a horrible accident?

Now Is Everything is the story of a teenager who gives everything she can to protect her little sister.  The book includes teen issues that will resonate with YA readers, such as abuse, self esteem, and guilt.  Although it seems unrealistic that the abuse would stay hidden, especially in light of the fact that Hadley had to change clothes in a school locker room, I thought that the author did a good job of bringing the sensitive issue to light.  I would recommend Now Is Everything to readers of YA realistic fiction and I look forward to reading more by this author in the future.",1515542400,4

Beautifully written, movingly told, and - however implausible aspects of the story may strike the reader -  brilliantly capturing aspects of 1922-1954 Russia in transition, albeit without  the Terror.

But, I'm glad I hung in there.  The book picks up speed and the last few chapters really pull you in and make you want to know what happens.
Overall, this was an interesting story - it's no Martian but very few books are.  But it's worth a read - or a listen (I think listening adds to the story).",1515542400,4
5587,63,343,"Wow! I really liked the Darker Shade of Magic series, and Victoria Schwab did it again with This Savage Song. Actually she did it better. I loved this. This book had me hooked from page 1 and did not let up at all.

The city of Verity was destroyed by war and is split into North and South. The north is controlled by Callum Harker. His citizens pay him to keep them safe from the monsters (Malchai, who drink blood and Corsai who eat their victims) The south is run by Henry Flynn who is far more nicer than Harker and just wants to keep his citizens safe.

The book centers around their children Kate Harker and August Flynn. Kate wants to be with her father and make her father proud, so she has gotten herself kick out of all the boarding schools she has been sent to so she can finally be sent home. August wants to make his father proud and help keep the treaty separating the two cities in tact. Oh yeah and August is also a monster, but he is a Sunai. Sunai do not kill just for the heck of it. They only kill those who have committed crimes. And their method is awesome. They use music and steal their souls.

When Flynn finds out that Kate is back in the North and going to school there, he arranges for August to also enroll in the school to keep an eye on Kate in case they need to use her as leverage if the treaty breaks. And then after a series of attacks Kate and August are forced on the run together.

I loved both Kate and August. I loved their interactions together. Even when things were tense, they still had some dialog that made me chuckle. I also liked the 3 different type of monsters that Victoria created.

Like I said I loved this whole book. There was never a dull moment. And as the book went on the tension and action really picked up and I couldn't read it fast enough.",1515542400,5
5588,63,651,"WOW!!! This book takes off running and does not let up until the very end. So much action, tension and yes sadness. Sometimes when the first book in the series is so good, it is hard to imagine how the second book can live up to it. Well Our Dark Duet, was right up there with This Savage Song.

When I said it took off running I ment it, The first paragraph in the book ""Kate Harker hit the ground running. Blood dripped from a shallow cut on her calf and her lungs were sore from the blow she had taken to the chest"" See told ya LOL

This book begins 6 months after This Savage Song. August is in South Verity and is the leader of the FTF's. Kate is hunting monsters in Prosperity. The war between the humans and monsters in Verity is getting deadlier. We still have the Malchai and Corsai and we now have a new Sunai.

But there is also a new monster in town, the Chaos Eater. This one brings out the demons in it victims, turns them into killers and feeds off the chaos. And when the Chaos Eater makes it way to Verity, Kate returns home to help fight it. And fighting there is lots of. This book is full of action. Victoria Schwab does not hold anything back in this book. Who will prevail, monsters or humans?",1515542400,5
5589,1002,132,"Wow. This book was incredible. The thing that really stood out to me and made the story even more impactful than it already was, was the Author's Note at the end. This book was based on real people and very real events during WWI. To read about all the specific events in the book that actually took placed was incredible and humbling. The stories of Eve and Charlie were so well woven together through the despicable Rene. The only thing that I would change would be the emphasis in certain places on Charlie's penchant for mathematics and equations. It was mentioned so little that when it was mentioned I found it distracting. Such a small complaint for a 500 page book, however. A great read and one I would definitely recommend.",1515542400,5
5590,864,1479,"This is a story of two women who share an apartment in New York,  but they do it in two different times; Ella moves into the space in the modern age after leaving her husband. Geneva lived there during Prohibition. At that time the building also housed a speakeasy and Ella sometimes hears the strains of jazz coming from a room in the basement.

Other than apartment the two women really have nothing to do with one another and their stories are completely different. As per usual with me I much preferred Genevas story and most of the book does tell her tale. Ellas is constructed to bring Genevas forward I believe. Its a little less developed and several plot points are left hanging. Its far less compelling as well.

As to Geneva  her story is a page turner. I got happy every time I turned a page and found myself in her world. Not that she lived in an easy world. Her back story is parceled out bit by bit as she works towards separating herself from her roots.

Overall I really enjoyed the book. I was very disappointed when I turned the last page and I do hope that Genevas story continues somewhere down the line. I feel she has so much more to say. But I don't know if that is going to happen. There are also several questions on Ellas side that were left unanswered so I don't know if that was intentional or what. But since I was more invested in Geneva perhaps Im not as bothered.

5591,61,819,"I don't get what the big deal is about this book. Good marketing?  I thought it was going to be super fantastic but I didn't even find it fantastic.  I'm thinking that perhaps it might not be a bad idea to be an aficionado  of Turner Classic Movies as there are a ton of clues, apparently in the parts where the book relates to the classics that Anna watches.  At times, I found it slow going and was going to give up but slogged along and it did pick up about mid-way.  I didn't find it ""gripping"", ""a page-turner"", or ""filled with a series of mind-boggling bombshells"".  It's not a book I would recommend to my friends.  Your life will not be enriched one way or another.",1515542400,3
5592,676,16,"I have to confess that I went into reading this book thinking that I wouldn't like it.  You see, highly-hyped books rarely, if ever, live up to expectations for me.  There have been countless books I probably would have loved if I had read them pre-release, or a few years after release.  This book, however, was the unicorn--it not only lived up to the hype, it surpassed it.  This book delivered on every single level and touched me in ways that I didn't expect.

The premise of the novel is far too familiar--an unarmed, young African-American man is gunned down by a police officer during a traffic stop.  The narrator, Starr, witnesses it and then finds herself in the center of the storm surrounding the murder.

What I appreciated most about Starr is that she multi-faceted, in a number of ways.  On one hand, she's a typical teenager dealing with very typical teenage issues.  But she's also in a unique place because she straddles two worlds.  Her family lives in the predominately African-American part of town, but she attends a school in the suburbs with a very small African-American community.  A good portion of this book is devoted to her trying to juggle these two realities, and I found it fascinating.  There are plenty of novels who tell of one of these experiences, but Thomas was able to amplify both worlds by putting them side by side.

I will admit that I fell in love with Starr's family.  It's not perfect (and, at times, it's a bit Maury Povich-worthy), but the characters are all so well-drawn, that I found myself feeling their sufferings and frustrations, as well as their joys.  I also loved the fact that it was a family that came together under stress, when usually we see the opposite.

This is not an easy book to read and Thomas does not back down from the difficult issues.  However, it is a necessary book to read.  I do not live in an area where racial unrest is a major issues, so I only experience through news reports covering incidents in other part of the country.  This book brought it home for me and made me feel as if I were part of the action.  For those of us who live in a relative comfort away from these issues, this book will break us out of our ivory towers.

I can think of few books that affected me as this one did and I have recommended it to everyone I've talked to since finishing it (and a re-read will happen later this year, since it is now on the docket for one of my book clubs!).  If you haven't read this book, please pick it up as soon as possible.  It is definitely a critical read.",1515542400,5

5596,1002,191,"I first read this book in 5th grade. I was in a group for gifted readers and had to do a project based on a book I read and this was the one I chose. I saw recently that Disney is making a movie of it, so I decided to head back to it to see, again, what it was all about.

As I started it, I realized I didn't remember much at all about reading it, or what is was about. It's definitely designed for children. I found it was much harder to stretch my imagination to fill in the picture, but assume it was easy back in 5th grade for me to do that. Nonetheless, it was an exercise in stretching my imagination, which was magnificent.

This also feels like the type of book that I could read over and over again and continuously find something new; a new truth or a new idea. This book is a classic and it is timeless and I believe I need a physical copy for my library so I can return to it often and remember the simple principles it so creatively displays.",1515542400,4

I want to try a bit of a different review style with this book.  One of my goals this year is to improve my reviews so they flow better.  I'm going to try a bulleted review... let me know if this reads better than my usual reviews!

1.  I really enjoy the main character in this one.  Meg is delightfully flawed in a world of heroines with no faults beyond their own stubbornness (which always turns out to be a strength in the end).  She is relatable even 50+ years after she was first written and it's lovely.

2.  The combination of the three children that really make this book delightful.  Calvin, Charles Wallace, and Meg have an amazing rapport.  They support one another and urge each other to be the best version of themselves.  There need to be more supportive siblings and friends like this in YA and Children's Lit.

3.  When I first read this book as a youngling, I desperately wanted to visit Uriel, and to meet Aunt Beast.  As an adult, I can appreciate the astonishing world-building.  A Wrinkle in Time takes place across five planets, and each of them are stunning and unique.  It's the sort of thing that makes the reader consider the possibilities of a greater universe and the Star Trek fan in me is delighted.

4.  Unfortunately, as with anything written so long ago, parts of it can feel a bit dated.  While Meg and everything off-Earth is delightful, there are definitely aspects of family dynamics and social perceptions that are not acceptable in our modern world.  These things aren't offensive, not quite, but they do make you pause and that's worth mentioning.

5.  I do want to talk a bit about Camazotz because... talk about a creepy dystopian world.  The synchronicity of its people and the heavily enforced regulations scream cruel dictatorship at every turn.  Then, of course, there is IT, which is a force of IT's own.  As a villain, IT and the Darkness are fascinating and intangible.  L'Engle has chosen *evil* as a concept as her villain, and even though this is a children's book, the shadow over the world are a bit chilling.

6.  I found myself having to focus hard while I read this, not because it was boring, but because the pacing is so fast.  It's the one fault that bothers me most - there is time for explaining scientific concepts, but not to really drink in the worlds.  I feel somewhat cheated of the experience.

7.  The science is fascinating and flawless.  A Wrinkle in Time presents its ideas in the same vein as classics by Jules Verne and H.G. Wells.  The explanation of tessering is perfect, both as a curious child and a critical adult.  It's so important that a science fiction novel is upheld by science... and this one is.  Yes!

8.  I have the commemorative edition from 1997.  I've had it for as long as I can remember.  I love this cover.  It suits the story perfectly.

I do believe that this book is subjective - while I like it a lot, I can see how others would not enjoy it.  It's a bit odd at times, and like I said, dated in some ways.  But the worlds and the underlying story are wonderful.  And, really?  Meg Murray may be the original Kickass YA Heroine.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys whimsy and philosophy of good verses evil, and anyone who is planning to see the movie in March.",1515542400,4
5598,640,549,"Dion Leonard, an Australian living in Edinburgh, Scotland, was in China for the 155-mile race through the Gobi Desert when a small brown ball of fluff with big eyes attached herself to him. As he ran each leg of the race, the dog kept pace with him. At one stage they crossed a water course, and when she called to him from the bank, Dion turned and picked her up, carrying her across. When it was obvious the little dog would remain by his side, he named her Gobi  her courage and tenacity was outstanding. She cemented her place in his heart; it was a special friendship.

When Dion and his wife Lucja were working out how to get Gobi home to Scotland, she went missing from the city of Urumqi in China. As Dion and the volunteers searched for Gobi, he wondered how he would ever find her  the city was home to thousands of stray dogs; how to find one in the maze of the rest? But help came from everywhere  international media, the internet and even the locals were caught up in the story of the missing Gobi. Would Dion be reunited with the extraordinary little dog who had adopted him as he ran across the sands of the Gobi Desert?

Finding Gobi is a wonderful, heartwarming story written by Aussie ultramarathon runner and author Dion Leonard. I flew through the story in a matter of hours; beautifully written, filled with heartfelt emotion and always the little dog who takes everyones hearts. An amazing true story about an incredible journey, and one I highly recommend. With thanks to my daughter from whom I borrowed the book after she recommended it to me.",1515542400,5

5601,403,425,"I always struggle with Colson Whiteheads novels, and I continue to do so with this book, The Underground Railroad, which landed the author the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize.  His novels leave me with the sense that there was more to do with the story, and he failed to seize that ground.

There is no doubt that a great talent had created this novel.  The story begins with a  familiar sense of things in the antebellum south, but soon changes to a strange sort of parallel world  familiar but out of order.  Whitehead preforms this feat well.

Whitehead is condensing the history of race in America in this story, presenting us, without regard to historical order, the impact of race in American life.  Yet, what Whiteheads characters say about race often isn't all that new, or presented in an engaging way.  Take this quote:

America is a delusion, the grandest one of all. The white race believesbelieves with all its heartthat it is their right to take the land. To kill Indians. Make war. Enslave their brothers. This nation shouldnt exist, if there is any justice in the world, for its foundations are murder, theft, and cruelty. Yet here we are.

This is true, all of it, and in the hands of a lesser writer, just fine.  But this book won two prestigious awards.  I wanted the author to provide a searing view of race in America.  But often, the language just falls back on words and themes we already know. So, for me, once again, Whitehead has not seized all the ground available. This makes The Underground Railroad a gripping and intriguing novel but far from a masterpiece.",1515542400,4

5605,145,70,"ance uses his life story and that of his family and extended family in order to explain the cultural and economical ways of the hillbilly. Just what is a hillbilly? Generally, they are someone who is from the Appalachian Mountain region who is poor, rural, and working class. Sometimes undereducated. The stereotype has them with no teeth because they drink Moutain Dew and don't go to the dentist.  Also that they are gun happy people ready to use them especially if you get their daughter pregnant.  The heavy popping of opioid pills such as Percocet and Oxy began in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky, which is where the term ""pillbilly"" comes from.

Vance's Mamaw and Pawpaw came from a holler in Kentucky called Jackson. He got her pregnant at the age of thirteen and the two took the famous Route 23 out of Kentucky to Ohio (sometimes referred to as ""Middletucky"") where a good job at a steel manufacturer, Amaco, awaited.  They weren't the only ones. Plenty of people from Appalachia left for jobs in Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania (or ""Pennsyltucky""), and Illinois. In the 1950s thirteen out of one hundred in Kentucky took the hillbilly highway out and in Harlan County Kentucky, thirty percent of its population, mostly coal miners, left.

Life was hard for his Mamaw and Pawpaw. She had several miscarriages and three children that survived.  These included Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Wee, and his mother.  His Pawpaw was an alcoholic and things could get ugly in their house.  He would straighten himself out and while he and his wife stayed married they would end up with their own separate homes once their kids were grown, but remained close.  But heaven help anyone who bothered one of the children or a member of the family. When Uncle Jimmy was five, he saw a toy in the pharmacy that he wanted for Christmas and his parents told him to go in and look at it while they finished shopping at a store. When he picked it up to play with it, the clerk in the store told him that he wasn't allowed to touch the toy and kicked the boy out of the pharmacy.  When his parents found him and found out what happened they went in and trashed the place and stood up for their son's honor, because how dare someone tell their son that he can't come in their store.

He would take a while to adjust to a new place as his mother moved him and his older sister, Lydnsey, around to different homes with different men.  The one constant was his Mamaw's place.  Life with his mother was hard as she had a temper and in her relationships, fighting was the only way she knew how to deal with things. So dishes went flying and she would get violent with the men in her life.

According to J.D., this was how most hillbillies acted. Also, they spent money they didn't have at Christmas on fancy gifts for the kids, hoping the IRS refund check would cover it.  Sometimes there would be someone in the house with a substance abuse problem.  In J.D.'s case, it was his mother who got hooked on pills.  They also abuse the Welfare system and try to get out of work if they can.

Vance basically says that you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but most of these people don't have boots. And he had helped himself.  His Mamaw received a pension check from his Papaw when he died and likely social security.  He credits his Mamaw, his sister, his teachers, and the Marines with helping him to avoid going down the wrong path and instead earning his degree at Ohio State and his law degree at Yale, something practically unheard of from where he was from.  He offers a lot of criticism but no solutions and he overgeneralizes and forgets the people in his life that weren't loud and violent like his sister and Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Wee and cousin Gail and their spouses.  It's like he wants them to be the exception that proves the rule, but there are more of them in his life than the violent argumentative types.  Also, I think there are plenty of people who are dying to get jobs of any kind if you just give them a chance.  And there are programs that train people in Appalachia to learn a new trade for a company that is in the area.  Vance is close to using stereotypes, though with stereotypes there is some truth to them.  Read this book with caution.

*Vance is contemplating a run for office and it is my opinion that he wrote this book as a stepping stone for this purpose. But that is just my opinion.

* I add this as I think it might be interesting and be a counterpoint to the book.

 I was born in poverty in Appalachia. Hillbilly Elegy doesnt speak for me.

J.D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy, in Washington in January. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)

By Betsy Rader September 1, 2017

Betsy Rader is an employment lawyer at Betsy Rader Law LLC, located in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. She is running as a Democrat to represent Ohios 14th Congressional District in the U.S. House.

J.D. Vances book Hillbilly Elegy, published last year, has been assigned to students and book clubs across the country. Pundits continue to cite it as though the author speaks for all of us who grew up in poverty. But Vance doesnt speak for me, nor do I believe that he speaks for the vast majority of the working poor.

From a quick glance at my rsum, you might think me an older, female version of Vance. I was born in Appalachia in the 1960s and grew up in the small city of Newark, Ohio. When I was 9, my parents divorced. My mom became a single mother of four, with only a high school education and little work experience. Life was tough; the five of us lived on $6,000 a year.

Like Vance, I attended Ohio State University on scholarship, working nights and weekends. I graduated at the top of my class and, again like Vance, attended Yale Law School on a financial-need scholarship. Today, I represent people whove been fired illegally from their jobs. And now that Im running for Congress in Northeast Ohio, I speak often with folks who are trying hard but not making much money.

Although high school graduation rates are rising and there are more private and federal grants available, most low-income students have a tough time attending and staying in college. Here are nine facts about poor students and the college experience. (Video: Claritza Jimenez/Photo: iStock/The Washington Post)

A self-described conservative, Vance largely concludes that his family and peers are trapped in poverty due to their own poor choices and negative attitudes. But I take great exception when he makes statements such as: We spend our way into the poorhouse. We buy giant TVs and iPads. Our children wear nice clothes thanks to high-interest credit cards and payday loans. We purchase homes we don't need, refinance them for more spending money, and declare bankruptcy. . . . Thrift is inimical to our being.

Who is this we of whom he speaks? Vances statements don't describe the family in which I grew up, and thy don't describe the families I meet who are struggling to make it in America today. I know that my family lived on $6,000 per year because as children, we sat down with pen and paper to help find a way for us to live on that amount. My mom couldn't even qualify for a credit card, much less live on credit. She bought our clothes at discount stores.

Thrift was not inimical to our being; it was the very essence of our being.

With lines like We choose not to work when we should be looking for jobs, Vances sweeping stereotypes are shark bait for conservative policymakers. They feed into the mythology that the undeserving poor make bad choices and are to blame for their own poverty, so taxpayer money should not be wasted on programs to help lift people out of poverty. Now these inaccurate and dangerous generalizations have been made required college reading.

Here is the simple fact: Most poor people work. Seventy-eight percent of families on Medicaid include a household member who is working. People work hard in necessary and important jobs that often don't pay them enough to live on. For instance, child-care workers earn an average of $22,930 per year, and home health aides average $23,600. (Indeed, it is a sad irony that crucial jobs around caretaking and children have always paid very little.)

The problem with living in constant economic insecurity is not a lack of thrift, it is that people in these circumstances are always focused on the current crisis. They cant plan for the future because they have so much to deal with in the present. And the future seems so bleak that it feels futile to sacrifice for it. What does motivate most people is the belief that the future can be better and that we have a realistic opportunity to achieve it. But sometimes that takes help.

Yes, I worked hard, but I didn't just pull myself up by my bootstraps. And neither did Vance. The truth is that people helped us out: My public schools guidance counselor encouraged me to go to college. The government helped us out: I received scholarships and subsidized federal loans to help pay my educational expenses. The list of helpers goes on.

Now that so many people have read Hillbilly Elegy this summer, I hope they draw this better moral from the story: Individuals can make a difference in others lives, and by providing opportunities for all, our government can do the same. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness should be legitimate expectations for everyone, hillbillies included.",1515542400,1

Joana fleeing Lithuania for Germany, Florian a Prussian soldier on a secret mission, Emilia a Polish teen fighting memories and avoiding the Gestapo, and Alfred a German sailor.

The ship, Wilhelm Gustloff was requisitioned to help Germans escape from East Prussia as the Russians closed in from the east, toward the end of the war. The Wilhelm Gustloff was sunk on Jan. 30, 1945 by a Russian sub and more than 9000 people perished, many children.

White Fang chronicles the harsh realities of life. When this book begins, two men and trying to bring back the body of a third using their dog sled team. There has been a lack of food and night by night one of their dogs go missing. Finally, they see the culprit - a she wolf who is luring their dogs away. Food is scarce, and she is part of a wolf pack trying to survive. Soon the men are being hunted by the wolves and it becomes a battle to survive. Besides She-Wolf (half dog half wolf), an older wolf called one eye is with the pack. Eventually they mate, and White Fang becomes their surviving pup.

Initially life is good for White Fang. He is inquisitive and lets his instincts help him learn to explore and hunt. But one day he and his Mother come across men ""Gods"" and their lives change. Soon Mother and Pup are separated, and White Fang gets his introductions into the harsh realities of life. He learns the pains of separation, the pains of beatings and the pains of not fitting in with the other dogs and wolves.  White Fang is sold and has an even more sadistic owner who turns him into a fighter.  Eventually White Fang is saved and begins a new life where he eventually knows kindness and trust.  He becomes part of a family again.

So now that I have told you the plot of the entire book, I will tell you that I really enjoyed this story. I liked how the story is mainly told through White Fang's POV.  It gives the reader a great look at White Fang's impulses, instincts, personality, fears and thoughts.  Well written and with a sweet ending. London captured the environment and elements brilliantly.

I did think the development of the characters was very good, however. Post-apocalyptic stories have the perfect environment for excellent characters, that's why I enjoying this genre? so much. Everything is happening is terrifying, who wouldn't change by these events? What these changes are is the interesting aspect of these stories. And Yancey delivers very well.

What I didn't like, then? The romance. It was so forced and fast, I didn't believe it. It could have been so much better but I didn't like the couple at all.",1515542400,3

5617,676,1073,"Folks, I was nervous about this one.  I read, and absolutely adored, Orphan Train a few years ago.  But then I had gone back and read some of Christina Baker Kline's earlier novels and my reaction was at best ""meh"" and, at worst, breaking out in hives.  I was left with this question: had she improved as a writer or was Orphan Train a fluke?  I am oh-so-thankful to say that this book was much closer in quality to Orphan Train than her earlier novels--and I just breathed a sigh of relief as I typed that.

This story is based on Andrew Wyeth's painting, Christina's World, which is both beautiful and, as I've always considered it, pretty darn depressing.  So, I knew going into this that it wasn't going to be a lighthearted romp.  To be sure, this book did deal with Christina's limitations and her struggles, but it wasn't as dark as I had expected. Like the painting, the book paints a picture of a life that most would consider wretched, but in which the subject finds some purpose and redemption.

Christina, a woman afflicted with a degenerative disease (as Baker Kline mentions in her author's note, it is believed that Christina did not suffer from polio, but from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), who must deal with the limitations of her physical body while also tending to her own family and their infirmities.  Admittedly, she is anything but a Pollyanna, but she also exhibits a notable resolve which more than compensates for her emotional struggles.

This is very much a character-driven novel .  Christina is as fully-developed as a character can be and Baker Kline expertly uses Christina's voice to flesh out the supporting characters.  I was especially interested in getting to know the other women in Christina's life, most of whom were people who inserted themselves into Christina's life and broke through the wall she had built around herself.

Now, here is the problem.  While I love character-driven books, I felt that this book was a little too character-driven.  I had a pleasant enough experience reading it, but I really felt like it needed to leave Christina's head a bit more.  There were times when I felt like the narration just sort of stalled and, when I came to those passages, it pulled me out of the story.

Would I recommend this book?  Yes, but not universally.  Readers who enjoys beautiful prose and a character-driven story will have much better luck with this book than those who go in expecting a strong plot.  This is the sort of book that a reader will sit with and savor rather than devour and digest.",1515628800,4

It wasn't perfect with some inconsistent details and the first half of the book seemed like the standard domestic thriller, but the second half of the book more than made up for the ""imperfections"". So I was reading the first half of the book and I thought I would know how it would end.  I was thinking it wasn't different from other books where the assistant or nanny or best friend takes away the husband.  But Daphne was such a surprising character, not a passive victim at all.  That's when the book got veryinteresting and unpredictable! I loved the ending.  Some of the inconsistencies which bothered me were:
1) If the Parrish family was so rich, how come Daphne and the girls took the train with Amber to New York City?  Why didn't they hire a limo from a car service?  Taking the train to NYC is for plebians like Amber and my middle-class family, so it surprised me that the Parrish family traveled that way too.
2) If Jackson was keeping such a close eye on Daphne, with Sabine's help, how was she able to sneak out and accomplish all she did as revealed at the end of the book?
3) The way Amber, a nobody, moved in on the family seemed so easy and I felt the readers had to withhold their disbelief.",1515628800,5
5621,304,897,"So, I know The Giver has been out for a long time, and I know they made a movie, but somehow I'd never read or watched it. But on the recommendation of a friend, I finally have. What a strange little book! It definitely belongs in the same realm as Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and The Handmaid's Tale - which are among my favorite books - but the ending was tremendously unsatisfying. It's the first book in a quartet, though, so I'm hoping the other three, which I have requested from the library, will tie up the loose ends. It definitely feels like it's only the first installment of a story.

The dystopian society in this book has effectively banished most feelings. But to get rid of hate and war and prejudice, they also had to banish the memories and feelings of individuality and difference. With everyone and everything the same, they're mostly incapable of feeling true love or happiness. So they all live in peace - but it's a complacent, uncaring peace. It's not peace because of love, it's peace because of the absence of passionate feelings. Whether this is good or not, well, that's up to the reader to decide for themselves. The actions of the main character, who aims to disrupt that peace, could be seen as good or bad.",1515628800,2
5622,939,1737,"I had originally purchased this book for one of my daughters. The only type of book that she would even look at were those that involved horses. While my daughter read this book long ago, it has just remained sitting on my digital shelf.

This is not a type of story that would attract me. If I venture into children's chapter books I usually stick to the worlds of science fiction or fantasy. However, there is no doubt that this is an amazing book.

The writing is splendid. The storytelling is vivid capturing both the horses and the humans so well that it is easily to picture them in your head. The plot is simple, it is a children's book, but well developed with conflict and anticipation. I was surprised that this book would evoke an emotional response in me. The ending was beautiful, but also bittersweet. In a way, it was inevitable.

The book was first published in 1947, so it does talk about a different time. There are not equal gender roles between the children. Boys were allowed to do some tasks, and girls others. However, for the time I am actually surprised at how liberal the book is. Also, the older characters smoke pipes and one of the children fed tobacco to a horse. I did not feel like this took away from the story at all, but it is values that may have changed from the setting of the piece. That being said, this book is still very worthy of being considered an amazing children's book.",1515628800,5

Unable to leave the house due to agoraphobia induced by trauma, Anna Fox is a former child psychologist who has been living alone in her NYC home for a little under a year. She spends her time drinking too much wine, unreliably medicating herself, and watching old movies. She checks in evenings with her husband, who recently separated from her, and their daughter. Her social life is online. She participates in an online support group for agoraphobics and provides new-comers with encouragement and advice. She plays chess and she takes French lessons online. She has a tenant downstairs to help her. Anna's psychiatrist and physical therapist make house calls.

She also spends a lot of time spying on her neighbors using her camera's zoom lens. When the Russells, father, mother, and teenage son, move into one of the five townhouses that Anna watches across the street, she does online research and knows immediately their names and what they paid for the house. When the son stops by and delivers a gift from his mother, Anna is surprised, but likes the boy. Then she actually meets the mother and is surprised at how much she enjoys her company (drinking). So when she witnesses a horrific, shocking event while watching them, she knows she needs to contact the police. But did she really see it or was it the combination of taking her medication with alcohol causing hallucinations.

The character of Anna is a wonderfully unreliable narrator. Clearly she is drinking w-a-y-t-o-o much and she knows she shouldn't take her medications with alcohol, but she does anyway, lies about it, and she knows she is not taking them as prescribed. The daily drinking until drunk is over the top (and annoying to some), but it does serve to make it clear that Anna may not be reliable or telling the truth. There are hints and glimpses that we don't know the whole story, that we really don't know Anna, and as the novel progresses, that fact becomes more and more clear. She has secrets, she's certainly paranoid, she's in denial, but is she delusional?

After a careful, slow start, The Woman in the Window took off at a gallop. The story, as it unraveled, was gripping and compelling. I stayed up way-too-late finishing the novel, telling myself, ""Just one more chapter."" There were several twists that took me by surprised and some I suspected. Finn found a way to have Anna housebound so the comparison's to Rear Window are obvious. Personally,  I liked the tie-ins to Rear Window and other Hitchcock movies, as well as other old black and white suspense movies. I thought they help create an atmospheric mood and added an extra depth to the novel. Finn also left some clues throughout the novel to keep the reader questioning and anticipating twists.

All in all, I found The Woman in the Window to be an excellent debut thriller of psychological suspense. The writing is remarkable and the plot is clever, sophisticated, and twisty enough to bring to mind some the best of Hitchcock's movies.  Definitely read The Woman in the Window.

5627,749,1697,"I was lucky enough to receive a copy of Everless from the author, who was doing a giveaway on Twitter a few months ago. At the time, Everless wasn't yet on my radar, but the concept really intrigued me, so I figured Id give it a shot. Since then, Ive seen countless reviews of it from people I follow  none of which Ive read yet because I wanted to form my own opinion first!

The concept  a world in which time is worth more than anything else  was interesting, but I was worried about the execution. I had no reason to be, because Holland does a wonderful job of immersing the reader into this new world. We understand how it works, what the stakes are. It gives such an urgency to the concept of poverty: in Sempera, you are quite literally bled dry to pay off your debts.

The characters were incredibly well-written. I loved Jules so much, and her relationship with her father was both beautiful and heartbreaking. I liked seeing her relationships with the other characters develop. At times she can be a little too naive, but thats probably somewhat realistic, given how she was raised.

For the most part I liked the plot and the writing. I blew through it pretty quickly, but felt that the ending was a little rushed. It could have easily been drawn out a bit more, I think some additional details could have fleshed things out nicely. I will say that it is certainly an impressive debut novel. And it definitely set things up very well for the sequel though, which I wish I didn't have to wait another year for!

Overall, I was a huge fan of Everless. If you're looking for a fantasy read, consider picking this up! You won't be disappointed.",1515628800,4
5628,1045,1697,"I am extremely conflicted about what to rate this. I am waffling between 3 and 4 stars sooooo I'm going to call it a 3.75 rating.....not a thing?...it is here in my brain. Anywho, back to the review, I don't mind admitting it...my name is Beth and I suffer from Old Lady Syndrome at times. In order to combat my memory lapses I take notes periodically with the hope of remembering to put into words everything I felt along the way. At first I was disheartened with the pacing. Then there was the lack of character development and to be completely honest, the plot as a whole was flailing. Yes the writing was very good. Yes the premise was unique BUT it felt very much like a setup book where there is very little going on definitively...no meat, no potatoes, just me starving for a decent plot, skimming and flitting about all the while stewing in resentment- waiting for book #2 to come out so that things can finally start in earnest. Around 64% there was still nothing major going on. The MC suffered from the doldrums and nothing was holding my attention fully. The identity of Jules's parents and the reasoning behind why the queen was so feared were the most interesting questions posed and even those inquiries did not compel me to keep turning pages. Only the preorder price and my own stubbornness kept me going. All of these factors usually amount to a surefire recipe for disaster BUT I am elated to report that I persisted! Not only did I persist but the last 30% was redemption incarnate!! And that ending...oh boy that ending left me fiending for more. I ended up loving someone I initially loathed (as we were often led to do) and detesting someone that I had eventually warmed up to (although done so with a healthy amount of well earned trepidation). The main twist blindsided me. The way in which it unraveled, though laborered in the beginning, was skilfully crafted. As it approached the finish line it commanded my attention and I ate it up in record time. Now now, I know some of you can inhale books at an inhuman rate (and I'm more jealous  about that than I care to admit) BUT here I reference my own (oft times sluggish) pace so please take the previous statement with a grain of salt.

In the end I found myself caring for the characters which was a wonderous feat in and of itself because I would have balked at that claim around the halfway mark.

Anyway, I highly recommend this book and if you find yourself hung up, dejected and thinking of putting it in the DNF pile then I hope you persevere as well because the ending is not only twisty and turny but it also sets up high expectations for the next book in the series. Happy reading!",1515628800,4
5629,16,1740,"I've had it in my mind for a while that meditation is something I need to add to my bag of coping skills. I downloaded a great app and have been trying out some guided meditations over the last few months. But, I wanted to know more. Just Sit by Sukey and Elizabeth Novogratz is hands down a fantastic guide for beginners (and honestly I think anyone) looking to expand and explore their knowledge of meditation and mindfulness.

Just Sit starts with the basics and expands and builds on that starting point. You're going to want to read from front to back instead of flipping around. (which is my usual tendency with non fiction books)

What is meditation? There's a brief chapter on the history. Why would you want to meditate? The health benefits are simply put - astounding. And it's backed up by medical studies. Seriously, I could not believe what just sitting and breathing would affect. And that's the thing - it's simply sitting still and breathing. How to meditate? There are chapters on what might or might not work for you. Remember there is no set 'must do' agenda. Equipment (a cushion!) or not, time, place, postures, mantras, focus, chakras, breathing, exercises, mindfulness and so much more.

I bookmarked so many pages as I read - there is a wealth of information here that needs to read more than once.  Now, having done that first read through, I am going to start with the basics (There's an eight week plan for beginners) and only progress when I feel ready to move on. As you do progress, there's some great strategies and ideas for dealing with your crap. You know what I mean - we all have unresolved issues that needs to be dealt with - both past and present.

All of this is presented in a really great format. Lots of illustrations, text boxes and white space make the information appealing and easy to read. And its written with candor and humour.

The most important piece I've taken away so far? Yep, it's that easy - just sit. Find the time - if it's only a minute to start, that's great. You started. Do it again tomorrow. And the next day. This is an awesome book for anyone looking to explore mediation - and themselves. Absolutely recommended.",1515628800,5
5630,792,301,"This was a book that I could not put down. I could identify with Alan on many things regarding the childhood abuse, only it was both of my parents. I spent lots of time in therapy and also doing genealogy finding a lot of hidden mental illness in my family.

I was so touched by your book. It was so well written. I am also a fan.
Good for you on writing this book as it was inspirational to me as I'm sure it was to many others. I'm also sure it was good therapy for you as well.  Bravo Alan, well done!",1515628800,5
5631,1045,1391,"~~~~4.5 Stars~~~~

WOW, I absolutely inhaled this book!! The writing was seamless. The world was devine. The middle did drag a bit but royal politics and in-depth character development can tend to lend itself to this type of dilemma. I decided not to penalise the rating too harshly because of this though I did waiver back and forth between 4 & 4.5 star...BUT seeing as how the sluggishness was coupled with some great writing... a grand and unique premise (especially for a topic so fervently explored)... a plot that had me constantly questioning everything I had presupposed along the way...I couldn't help but bump up the rating sooooo a well deserved 4.5 stars it is.

Now onto the dual POVs. Imo the very distinctive POVs played perfectly off one another, a frequently attempted endeavour that many stories fail to accomplish. The backdrop seemed both masterfully crafted as well as meticulously researched creating an undeniably authentic atmosphere. The characters were breathtakingly, ""humanly""flawed. Nahri, our heroine, was a little annoying at times but ultimately her loyalty and overall potential was endearing. I can definitely see camps for favored male characters being formed down the road. Who was my favorite you ask?!? Well I won't go into too much detail but I will say that though Dara seems like the perfect companion/protector, I couldn't help but root for sweet naive Ali. Speaking of camps, it's probably obvious from my previous admission BUT fair warning: there was a most salacious love triangle percolating (though very minimally acted upon) which happened to be the impetus for much of the drama SO if that's not your thing...you've been warned.

I couldn't help but obsessively check Chapter and Location progress. This is usually a bad sign in my world BUT here it was for all the right reasons. I watched the pages fly by wishing to stall the inevitable and THAT hasn't happened to me in a long while....sad, I know, but true.

Anyhow, ultimately many MANY questions went unanswered, leaving me with a nagging hunger for the next book, STAT. So hurry up please, I NEED answers!!!",1515628800,5
5632,304,1741,"Yet another fantastic debut novel! My husband picked this up at the library; the dark blue edging on the pages had caught his attention, as well as the gorgeous blue and gold cover with its enigmatic title. I am very glad he brought it to my attention, as it was a beautiful, touching read.

The Golem and the Jinni is the tale of two immigrants in early 19th century New York. These aren't your typical immigrants, however. The Golem, created by a mystic in Poland, was made-to-order by a man wanting a wife. He died on the voyage over, hours after awakening her. With her original master-bond broken, the Golem is learning her way around New York and human society, with the help of an old Jewish rabbi who recognized her for what she is.

The Jinni, on the other hand, has been bound in a bottle for close to a thousand years, and is released accidentally by an Arab tinsmith. He is also learning about New York and human society, but where the Golem is coming at it from a place of innocence, he is jaded and old. The two eventually meet, recognizing each other for non-human, and begin a wary friendship built on their mutual lack of needing to sleep and hatred of boredom.

As the novel progresses, their lives begin to intertwine in unexpected ways, and we learn more about their histories from flashbacks; in the Golem's case, the flashbacks are of her creator's life, since we see the beginning of her own at the start of the novel.

As the novel progresses, it builds up momentum until it seems an unstoppable force heading to its surprising conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, and find myself surprised it was the author's first. It brushed on philosophical questions, moral questions, societal norms - and all of it so naturally. The book delved into human nature and the nature of free will, with both main characters unsure of their own capability for free will for different reasons, and fighting those very limitations on their individuality.

I discovered in a Q&A on Wecker's website that she is Jewish and her husband is Arab-American, which explains partly why she was able to blend the two cultures' mythologies so easily (and to wonderful effect!) in this book.",1515628800,5
5633,56,1741,"The Golem and the Jinni is a genre bender.  There is a lot of historical fiction woven in, so if you are looking for a straight fantasy novel this may not be for you.

The writing in this book reminds me a lot of The Bear and the Nightingale in that it felt very atmospheric as well as giving off a strong classic fairy tale vibe.  This book has a very slow pace overall, most of the action happens in the last 15% of the book.  The author gives of us a lot of backstory interwoven with the characters present day actions, and none of it is really tied together until the end.  The ending was sort of fantastic, like the lynch pin that holds everything together.  For these reasons, this book will take patience to read.

The characters take time to grow on you.  Maryam Faddoul, Arbeely, and the Rabbi I liked right from the beginning, but the Golem and the Jinni you grow to love over the course of novel and again, it isn't until the end that you really feel anything for them.

My only real issue with this book, involves big spoilers so read ahead at your own risk: The deaths of Michael Levy and Dr. Saleh seemed to be glazed over.  No real gravity was given to their deaths.  They seemed so tragic in that they were completely innocent and Dr. Saleh's was completely heroic, but none of the characters in the book seem to acknowledge their deaths or their sacrifices and this kind of bothered me.  I personally didn't feel much about them one way or the other, and I felt like I should have.  I should have wanted to cry about it but I didn't, which is why I gave the book overall 4 stars and not 5.",1515628800,4

5636,749,1181,"I went to Joe Hills release of Strange Weather a little while back and I finally finished this masterpiece recently. As the above blurb indicates, this is a compilation of four short novels written by Joe Hill. Each novel has an eerie twist to it  most are supernatural in some way and one isnt.

This collection was an easy five stars for me. Each story blew me away in one way or another. Joes writing never fails to be any less than spectacular, he really is an incredible storyteller. Below Ill go through and detail my thoughts on each story (and also share some of the relevant content warnings). They were all five-star reads for me, so ratings aren't necessary this time around!

Snapshot is the first piece in the book and it reeled me right in. I had a visceral reaction to this one, it had me on the edge of my seat and I could actually feel the fear coursing through me. It was the combination of the tone of the writing and the content itself. The only cw I can think of currently is for memory loss, as its pretty heartbreaking in the context of this story. I may or may not have cried at the end of this one.

Loaded was the second piece and it was an intense one, a take on modern gun violence and police brutality. This was also a very painful read, there are a few scenes that I wasn't expecting and I damn near lost my mind reading them. I actually had to put down the book and message Destiny at one point because I knew she would wail over one scene in particular with me. cw racism, domestic abuse, suicide, alcoholism

Aloft was the third piece. I had heard an excerpt from this at Joes reading, so I knew a bit about the piece and where it was going. Where it went after that excerpt was kind of wild, though. It went in a direction I wasn't really expecting, but I enjoyed that aspect of it a lot! This was probably the weakest story in the collection imo, but still very good.

Rain was yet another heart-wrenching story. But!!! The main character is a queer woman, so thats rad. The concept here was really cool too, especially because there was a somewhat scientific aspect behind it (although I cant speak to how accurate that actually was). cws for homophobia and animal death, theres actually a somewhat graphic illustration on the title page (right after Aloft) that might startle or upset some people, so please keep that in mind!!

Overall, this was such a stunning collection and I cant wait to get my hands on the rest of Joe Hills work, as theres still some stuff I haven't read yet!",1515628800,5
5637,747,1700,"This book stayed with me for days and I kept on thinking about the main characters. Almost all of them are victims of oppression and governmental intervention into the most private aspects of family life. They also don't mind to oppress other family members, manipulating them and controlling their privacy. I had very mixed feelings about Hann who wanted freedom and promiscuity in his homosexuality and married life with wife and child. He absolutely didn't care of robbing his wife of meaningful, loving relationship with a partner capable of living and cherishing her. This relationship was pretty doomed from the start. The government control over citizens considered less then and blatant disregard of their rights, lives and privacy was horrific. Could that be Chinas future with their huge deficit of female segment of population?",1515628800,5
5638,929,1375,"I had not read any earlier books in the Blessings series, so if you have you may give this one a better rating. The small Kansas town featured was apparently bought on eBay by the current lady mayor. I don't know any more about that. I think a couple of recap pages before the start would be a good idea as by now the soap opera nature of the series has produced many threads about very many characters.

I enjoyed the lively mix of people both incomers and long residents, kids and adults and social responsibilities. We start as two newcomer children, just adopted, are in a car struck by a tornado. Their guardian is seriously injured and they fear they will be sent back to foster care. This town has a multicultural population and social services are cranky about putting the right kids with the right carers. I liked the tale and would read more of the series but really I'd need to read some of the earlier ones first to figure out who everyone is and what is happening. This is not a standard romance story but does include romantic aspects, like life.

Both Kate and August are well developed and I loved their characters, although August is my absolute favorite. I love the idea of the different monsters and the plot is excellent as well The story doesnt end with that big of a cliffhanger either, but I will definitely be waiting impatiently for the second book.

(Honestly, I think one thing that held me back from connecting with them more quickly was the lack of quotation marks. It made it difficult to read the dialogue.) Captain Kidd is a quintessential Western character reminiscent of Larry McMurty's Call and Gus (Lonesome Dove). You can't help but fall in love with the character. Then, there is poor Johanna.

She indulges heavily in Hitchcock movies and watches her neighborhood through her windows.  Whether she sees something threatening or not, she is a dubious witness;  easily dissuaded from her point of view by her own panic attacks.  As a reader, it is a twisty tale, difficult to unwind and intensely interesting.  Its not often we are treated to so many very tempting details in one sweet tale and this one delivers from beginning to end.  It is a delight for those readers who seek puzzles with answers that are well-hidden.  I received my copy from the publisher through edelweiss.",1515628800,5
5645,33,76,"My daughter recommended this book so I bought it and it was just not my cup of tea.  If you like fairy-tale adventure type stories, you'll love this book.  It was very ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" style.

In reading the book description, it sounded like it was going to be a war era survival type tale and was imagining a story of an imprisoned man living as a trapped criminal in a small room with little to eat watching the world go by during war times while slowly sinking into depression and madness.  The book was nothing like that.

This is a story of a foreign aristocrat who is imprisoned for his writings BUT he is forced to live in a luxury hotel with access to all of the amenities the hotel has to offer.  He frequents the upscale dining, drinks Champaign and Cognac, goes to the hotel barber, entertains guests of all walks of life, befriends a young girl who he goes exploring the hotel (complete with hidden doors and passageways) with and later raises her daughter in the hotel.  If this is imprisonment, sign me up!  I understand this is just a work of fiction but it was just not what I was expecting and I was very disappointed.  In addition to the silly plot, the author OVER describes everything!  Every single meal or drink the characters have is described right down to the herbs and seasonings used and the temperature it was cooked and served at.  I would say that a good third of the book was dedicated to these long descriptions.  It was, in his words, maddening!",1515628800,3
5646,592,982,"The Girls Next Door was a secret guilty pleasure of mine. It was on during a weird time in my life. I was the new mom to a toddler and a baby. My baby boy slept very little and I found myself being up with him at all hours. During those hours I would often tune into E! And watch hours of mind numbing TV while I cried and desperately tried to rock my baby to sleep (I had baby blues depression and he had colic.) My favorite show was GND , their lives were seemed so fun and carefree (so unlike my chaotic one) Then I watched an episode were the girls were throwing another playmate a baby shower. Holly seemed so depressed, like she would trade everything she had to be the one having the baby instead. In that instant rocking my baby I felt very lucky and started feeling better. Holly became my favorite on the show (the classy shy one)and I still followed her life after the show So I was interested to read her book.
The book while very dishy. Also seems a bit short sighted. A lot of the insults and complaints she lodges. Could easily apply to herself. She lambasts cookie cutter gold digging blondes. While admitting she modeled herself after Hugh Hefners ideal image of a woman, and moved into the mansion because she had nowhere else to go. She constantly refers to ""mean girls"" while saying mean nasty stuff about other women.
I did find her chronicling of her early years in the mansion interesting. The early 2000's were a very different time. I hardly think in todays ""woke"" climate. That a series about  three blondes and the old man who sexually and emotionally abuses them would be so successful.
In the end I'm happy she found some happiness in her life and hope this book gave her closure.",1515628800,3
5647,304,598,"This is the story of Katy Tur's time on the campaign trail as one of the journalists covering Donald Trump's campaign. It is, as she says, unbelievable. When it begins, she thinks it will be very short - as most of the American public thought. No one thought Trump would wind up being the Republican nominee. But as she attends rallies, and watches the vitriol of his supporters - which occasionally gets turned on her, as a member of the ""lying, fake media,"" she begins to realize he could, in fact, win this thing.

We experience Tur's shock as he calls her out by name multiple times, leading to death threats by Trump supporters, and security being assigned to her specifically. Through all of this, Tur continues to do her job as a journalist, reporting on the travel, the rallies, the information from sources within the campaign as they criss-cross the country and promise ridiculous things.

I was worried at first that the book would be a dry rehash of the events, but it is far from it. Tur speaks with a refreshing, absorbing voice. Even knowing the outcome - that Trump is elected president - it's a page-turner that didn't let me go until the last page.

This was BRUTAL!! This book was raw and beautiful and will stay with you for a VERY long time! I love, love, LOVED the writing which was stunning and real. I'll admit it, I'm here, just having finished this book, and I'm broken into pieces crying. It's not that civilized, sniffling, dab at your eyes and it's done kind of crying. It's the soul abraded, snot dripping cry that leads my hubby to ask why I choose to read things that tear me apart emotionally.
This was told by 3 different characters perspectives, all of whom I fell in love with which is extremely rare. Usually I am skipping through one characters ramblings just to get back to another I liked best. That was definitely not the case here, even the supporting cast were amazing. I might go as far as to say that this contemporary story has some of the best character development I have read in a LONG time! All three MCs were human, strong yet weak at the very same time. They were complex and realistic and ultimately it HAD to be done with dueling POVs..I can not picture the story working better any other way. If you can imagine it, amongst all of the griminess and heartache there was romance and thankfully it was sans insta-love. I want to tell you to run out and read this asap because of the breadth of its beauty and the skill in which it was executed...BUT it feels weird telling you to do so because I know that the subject matter is merciless and that you too will be lacerated and laid bare...a puddle of sobbing feels.

This book, through a different approach, does an outstanding job of showing the effects of a suicide.

The whole community was taken aback when the news that Hannah Baker commited suicide spread throughout the small town of Crestmont. One day Clay Jensen comes home from school to find a mysterious package on his bed. Upon opening it he finds seven cassette tapes. After retrieving a cassette player he inserts the first tape only to hear the voice of Hannah Baker. Each tape revolves around someone once close to Hannah and how they contributed to her suicide. Some people deserve it and some reasons may be a little dramatic, but regardless the book follows clay as he tries to come to terms with how he could be on the tapes. Towards the end of the novel, Clay takes what he has heard, becomes wiser, and reconnects with an old friend name Skye who is overall acting as Hannah did. Clay even states,  You don't know whats going on in anyones life but your own. despite that fact he still tries to help Skye. Asher, a talented author from Arcadia, CA does a superb job of ending the book with a solid and understandable conclusion.

Throughout the novel Thirteen Reasons Why, Jay Asher does an excellent job of showing the effects of a teen suicide on a town entirely as well as people individually. Hannah Baker may have overreacted at times, but overall she had valid reasons for doing what she did. The book was very well written and worth the read.",1515715200,4

5669,534,69,"There are many ways to take a novel. What struck me most about ""Persuasion"" is the nature of the society that it reflects. This novel is about and was written by a member of the upper class landed gentry of 19th century England. This was a class of people who, from the novel at least, appear to perform no economic function at all.  Sir Walter Elliot, father of the heroine Anne, is a landlord who lives off the rent collected from tenant farmers. He does not administer his estate. That is performed by Mr. Shepherd. His family and their relations do nothing but arrange dinners, parties and excursions. The novel is replete with descriptions of their ""walks"" as they go about the countryside which, at times, gives them the opportunity to see the lower classes at work. There is an obsession among them of social rank and precedence. Austen does highlight this concern with social rank and does contrast this somewhat with the challenge this faces with the rise of the naval officer, in the example of Captain Wentworth,  in society. These officers do perform some social role beyond that of consumption.

""Persuasion"" is a novel of its time and reflects the social attitudes of it. It is supposedly a romantic novel But I personally find the characters bloodless",1515715200,3
5670,725,21,"Sarah Pinborough'sBehind Her Eyeswas exactly what I wanted: a pulpy, twisty read more interested in delivering thrills and keeping you off balance than in worrying about exploring deep thematic resonance. That may sound like a slam, but it certainly isn't intended as one; after diving throughHis Dark Materialsand dealing with holiday stresses, there was something great about having a book about nothing more than playing games with the reader. The plot starts simply enough, following two women as they go through their lives. One is a doctor's wife, struggling with some mental health issues and dealing with a tense, fraught marriage; the other is the secretary where the doctor has recently been hired, who has started up a flirtation with the doctor while unaware of his marriage status. Flicking back and forth between the two perspectives, Pinborough lets us think that this is merely going to be a story about two women and the tensions between them, only to drop the rug out from under us with a casual aside that reveals that there's a much more devious game going on, and one of our narrators isn't as innocent as she seems. What follows from there is a gleefully twisty read, one that rapidly chews through being aGone Girl-esque mindgame before evolving into something even wilder (an evolution that will no doubt either make or break the book for some people, depending on how open they are to books that gearshift into a whole other novel at some point). And it all leads up to a series of wild twists that managed to fool me, and I think I'm a pretty seasoned thriller reader; every time I thought I was getting ahead of the book, it managed to trick me again. I had a blast with it, and while I have a couple of minor misgivings related to thevery end of the book, all in all, it's a blast of a read - a wonderful little piece of pulpy psychological manipulation.",1515715200,4

5682,643,16,"Wow. This book was phenomenal. it completely lived up to the hype.

I have a lot of thoughts on this so here they are (keep in mind this is coming from an Asian American from the Bay Area):

I loved how educational it was. It really made you understand the Black Lives Matter movement and the reality of it. It hit every single point and put you right in the middle of it.

I also liked how Angie Thomas made brought up big points in really subtle ways. For example, Funny how it works with white kids though. Its dope to be black until its hard to be black (11). That is so true. People only like black culture when its cool , but the minute something bad happens to the black community, they distance themselves from it. But the quote that really hit hard was, Funny. Slave masters thought they were making a difference in black peoples lives too. Saving them from their wild African ways. Same Shit, different century. I wish people them would stop thinking that people like me need saving (246). I read that quote and was like, damn, preach it girl!

The minority alliance between Starr and Maya made me so happy.  It was so good to see a black girl and her Asian best friend team up. Angie Thomas could have done a bit more with it, but it was still nice to see it included. Personally, I think we need more minority alliances because there is more that unites us than divides us and together we can make a big impact. #Asians4BlackLives

I also liked that this tackled interracial dating. It added an extra layer to the complexity of this novel.

The pop culture references were a really nice and unexpected touch. I was definitely not expecting High School Musical and the Jonas Brothers to be mentioned in this book.

Overall, this book was everything. It should be taught in schools because despite being fiction, it was so informative, thought provoking, and leaves the door open for a lot of discussion.",1515715200,5
5683,835,1673,"Hate to Want You is the first book by Alisha Rai that I read and it won't be my last! You can say that this book has a lot of drama and it was a bit over the top but still so good!

The story picks up 10 years after all the drama and scandal of both the Oka-Kane and Chandler families. This is a classic Romeo and Juliet story about warring families only it ends with an HEA. Im a sucker for second-chance romance and Hate to Want You is a totally different spin on the trope.

I enjoyed listening to Hate to Want You and I love how Alisha Rai has added a twist to the usual Romeo and Juliet romance. I also liked that the heroine, Livy is the rebel and the hero is the good boy.

This book, though has a small-town soap opera drama feel to it and yeah, it was pretty dramatic! Lets just say that the Chandlers and the Oka-Kanes are one of the richest family in their town AND had a talked about the scandal surrounding Nicks mom and Livys dad. Not to mention the fact that Nicks father swindled Livys mom from her half of the company. Yeah, talk about dramatic!

Another thing that I liked about this book is the family dynamics. Alisha Rai does a very good job in helping the family heal and although there isn't a lot of healing going on, I am assuming that the family will finally be brought back together in the next two books in the series.

Hate to Want You is pretty spicy, and we do get a lot of sexy times between Nick and Livy. Oh, and Im not complaining because Alisha Rai does an awesome job in this department!

My only complaint is that this book does feel very short and Livy and Nicks reunion felt rushed. I also do not understand all the hype surrounding this book because even though it was an enjoyable read, Hate to Want You did not blow me away.

This book is also written in dual POVs and I am very glad that is written this way because honestly, Nick started as being an unlikeable character early in the book. The dual POV definitely benefited Nick the most.

I listened to the audiobook and it was narrated by Summer Morton and Jeremy York and I have mixed feelings about the two! I liked Summer Morton but Jeremy Yorks female voice is horrendous! OMG! He uses this high pitched tone for his female voices and its just like nails on a chalkboard! UGH! PLEASE NO!

I am also not a fan of the cover ONLY because of that vine tattoo! I mean, it just looks like a Photoshop brush! Its supposed to be a BEAUTIFUL TATTOO and whats more, Livy is supposed to be a renowned tattoo artist and this does not look like any tattoo a renowned artist would have on her skin! This is an epic cover fail for me.

Overall, I recommend Hate to Want You but if you can, DO NOT listen to the audiobook! I was even surprised that I was able to finish the audiobook because I normally stop listening when the narrator sucks.",1515715200,3
5684,582,1391,"Content Warning: Graphic violence, Rape, Slavery, Prostitution, and Human Trafficking.

Where do I even being to discuss this chunker of a book?

A book with this much stuff in it is difficult to review, no matter which way it's tackled. Unfortunately, my review won't be as in-depth as I would like; I listened to the audiobook version, and feel like I missed out on a lot of detail doing so. Reading a physical book definitely has it's perks, especially when there are multiple titles and names to keep track of. And this book has a lot.

If you haven't read this book, if you love fantasy, if you love fantasy set in different cultures, if you love diverse characters (in many aspects), then you might enjoy this book! Set in Cairo, Egypt (at least in the beginning) The City of Brass brings a unique perspective, background, and story to the reader. Nahri is a con-artist, used to swindle people out of their money in order to make ends meet. While her motive isn't necessarily bad, seeing how she wants to one day get an education to become a real and reputable healer, she rarely reflects on the methods she takes in order to do so. Little does Nahri know that she is closer to becoming a healer than she realized, but in a way that she completely doesn't expect.

Through a mishap with one of her exploits, Nahri accidentally summons a djinn warrior, (a spirit capable of doing good or evil in Islamic mythology). Before his appearance, Nahri never believed in the supernatural, or that the magical world exists. Yet, she discovers from this ancient warrior that her fate is tied to the mythical city of brass; Daevabad.

While this is a Young Adult fantasy, it teeters on the fence and falls into an adult tale. Nahri is in her twenties. Considering some of its content, it's clearly geared towards a mature reader. It is told from the perspective of two main characters, Nahri and Ali. Ali's is a djinn prince living in Daevabad. He comes from a very different, yet, not-so-different background than Nahri. Being raised away from his royal family and learning to protect his older brother's (the future king) life no matter the cost, Ali is exposed to the hardships the ""undesirable"" djinn tribes have. When he is returned to the palace and appointed to take the place at the head of the royal guard, his position is flipped. He now punishes those he grew up with by order of his father. Ali struggles greatly with the justice in his new position and gets himself into compromising situations when he takes matters into his own hands.

Ali's character brings to light just how much injustice and oppression goes on between the djinn tribes in Daevabad. While certain groups are favored, others are seen as having impure blood, and second-class citizens.

On the journey to Daevabad, Nahri learns all about the djinn history and cultures. Learning that she is not entirely human, (view spoiler) make these issues all the more relevant to her situation.

The problem with a book being this long is that the beginning and end feel like two different stories. I think the disconnect comes from the varying speeds in the plot, along with the appearance and the disappearance of some characters. While this long story takes its sweet time in revealing all the pieces (okay, not really all), I felt like there were unnecessary scenes added just to distract the reader and prolonge the inevitable.

Another issue I had with this read was keeping track of all of the names. There are so many terms that I never became familiar with, and felt could have used a little more explanation or fewer variations of terms used.

Overall, this was an enjoyable read. I'm looking forward to it's the sequel The Kingdom of Copper coming out this year to see what happens next. There are a lot of loose ends that need answering, and a lot more to happen (for sure!)

Vulgarity: Quite a bit.
Sexual content: Nothing in detail, yet there are references to it, and some of the characters are often seen in harems (prostitution is obvious).
Violence: Quite a bit of graphic violence.

My Rating: ",1515715200,4
5685,1052,958,"In all honesty, if I had just read the synopsis on this book, I probably never would have picked it up. Its just not my normal cup of tea. But I had come across a sample of the first chapter it in a booklet I had gotten at an event somewhere (I think the BN B-Fest), and that sample alone just wouldnt get out of my head. So when it came time for my reading mood to go man, I need a contemporary, I thought that this one should be it.

For this review I am going to split it up into two viewpoints: a critical one and a personal one, because thats the only way I think I can do it.

Critical:

In short, this book is well written. The characters are diverse and realistic, with flaws that are defiantly human and character arcs that make sense to who they are as presented from the start. The writing draws the reader in easily from the start, and retains the attention throughout without ever losing steam. In the beginning, it does feel a bit like there isn't a lot of movement in terms of an overall storyline arc, with only one character, Grace, having a personal goal  to find her birth mother. The other two just sort ofexist for a bit until their storylines start to take shape and their personal issues grow and changes come into their lives that they have to overcome. So for a while it felt like nothing was really happening while the characters (and the reader) were just kind of getting to know one another. Which is fine, but again, I felt like I needed a little bit more, and not just the small hints that were given here and there.

Personal:

I just felt very little emotional connection to the characters and this book overall. This is not a statement about the quality of the book  I can certainly see a lot of people enjoying it and loving it much more than I do  I just don't think I really connected with any of the characters. Graces storyline, the one that drew me to this book in the first place, was kind of the only one I ever had any really interest in, and Joaquins garnered some of my attention too. But Mayas I could have cared less about. I don't know why, it just didn't click with me for some reason. Maybe because it was such a typical storyline Ive seen before so often  fighting parents, alcoholic mom  that there wasn't really anything I didn't already expect from it to happen. So, sadly, I just didn't find myself really caring either in a positive or negative way about this book while reading it. I felt like at any point I could have stopped and never really needed to pick it back up because I had no pressing desire to know what was going to happen next.

Still, despite my semi-indifference towards this story and these characters, I will admit to getting emotional at the end (although not as emotional as these characters who really cry an awful lot), and I did think their overall character and story arcs were wonderfully done. The story, like I said, was well written (okay there were a couple of times I thought the randomly thrown in metaphors and allegories were a little overdone), moved at a decent pace, and definitely has a lot to say about the importance of family and what it means to be one. Despite the fact that I personally didn't feel completely enthralled by this book, I would still probably end up recommending it to people depending on their taste.

5686,937,833,"Chasing Christmas Eve revolves around two workaholics who hold tightly to their secrets perhaps too tight.y in the end.  While there is plenty of Christmas touches and celebrations in this story I wouldnt call it a Christmas romance.  This is purely Spence and Colbies romance that just happens to have a Christmas Eve deadline.

Thanks to a kitten and a rambunctious dog, Colbie and Spences first meeting is a rather spectacular splash into the wishing fountain.  And just that quickly two strangers make a connection that neither can explain.  Oh, its not instant love but definitely instant attraction with the feeling that there could be more if, and its a huge if, they let down their guard walls.

Colbie has run away from home  so to speak.  Shes a hugely popular YA author with a movie premiere of one of her books coming up soon.  Shes supposed to be doing promotional work, and writing an additional story for this series that in her mind is done.  And shes facing a massive writers block.  So she ran away from home hoping to find her muse once again away from the deadlines and the constant tending to her small family.  Since her father left Colbies mother has pretty much let her take over the reins of the house and her younger twin brothers upbringing.  They all depend on Colbie far too much to the point of being unable to function without her guidance.  Everyone needs to put on their big pants here and grow up but thats far from easy and constantly on Colbies mind.  So while San Francisco might not have been Colbies first run away destination, its soothing to simply be herself here and not that famous author or the one who holds the household together.  Here she can just be Colbie  even if that does mean she keeps secrets from some people and one man who could mean everything to her.

Spence is a super genius who is holding on to some secrets of his own.  He is under the impression that he can either focus on his work or his personal life  trying to mix the two has always meant that one part loses, in a damaging to the other way.  Hes on a deadline for his invention that will do some real good for a lot of needy people but hes stuck and its driving him insane.  The last thing he needs is a romantic entanglement, especially one with an expiration date of Christmas Eve, when Colbie will return home to Boston.  For once, Spence is finding that he can separate work and personal, and while it might not be easy it is doable.  Now he has to convince Colbie to give up her secrets, and let her into his before its too late but it might already be beyond his control.

Chasing Christmas Eve has everything I love about the Heartbreaker Bay series going for it.  Everyone needs a bunch of tight knit friends like Spence has, even when they work counter to his wishes in the guise of protecting him.  The bantering and teasing as always is fun and comfortable, the laugh out loud moments were some of the best moments of Colbie and Spences story.  Learning to trust, whether its someone else or yourself, is never easy.  There is a scene with Colbie and Spences female friends that simply broke my heart.  Its hard to be the outsider, especially one that hasn't opened up to who they really are so that others can trust them with a precious friend.  We have a few suspicions confirmed, and a lot of catching up with previous couples as they are now.  This is a story that I would recommend to any Romance reader.  Its a strong, caring addition to this series and is definitely on my re-read shelf for the future.

I own a Kindle edition of this story.",1515715200,5

I enjoy historical fiction and this series set in England during the start of the Industrial Revolution made for an enjoyable read.

I thought the characters were well-developed, and the plot was interesting with several twists to keep me turning pages.

The romance was heated and developed naturally instead of feeling forced, making it believable.

I'm looking forward to future books in this series.",1515715200,4
5695,816,650,"I can't believe it's taken me so long to get to the second book in the Ravenel's series, especially when I loved Reese Winterborne so much in Cold-Hearted Rake. I do recommend that you read these books in order as Helen and Reese's story really begins in the first book.

Helen Ravenel is an oddity in her family, the meek and genteel sister in a family of outspoken and wild siblings. In Marrying Winterborne, we see Helen come out of her shell and go after what she wants most in the world - freedom and Reese Winterborne. I was so proud of Helen for the courage and tenacity she displayed and truly went after what she wanted. I was even more impressed when she discovered a horrible secret and she was inclined to put her integrity and the well-being of others before her own happiness.

Reese Winterborne is a coarse Welshman, and a self-made man who lifted himself from a grocer's son to a filthy rich businessman with the largest department store anyone has ever seen. Pride seems very important to Reese, and when his pride was hurt in Cold-Hearted Rake, Reese struck out in anger and insulted Helen's family. Not that I could blame Reese, I really didn't like Kathleen and the way she butted into everyone's business. So Reese wasn't really expecting Helen to come back to his life in any good way, and he was shocked (but very appreciative) when she did. I really really liked Reese. I liked his coarse ways and take no prisoners attitude.

One of the better things about this novel was the structure. Having Reese and Helen come together very early on was a nice change of pace from other historicals where we follow the courtship for the majority of the book. I always like digging into the meat of the relationship and seeing how our couple will interact once the match has been solidified. So I enjoyed all of the relationship building, the drama and even the secrets that occurred to test our couple's love and loyalty for one another.

The narrator for this story, Mary Jane Wells, was excellent. Her portrayal of Reese's character and accent was captivating. I was thoroughly impressed by her ability to create different sounds, accents and mannerisms for each of our characters. She was very talented and I highly recommend listening to this book in audio if you are able.",1515715200,5
5696,395,1399,"Ahoy there me mateys!  I absolutely fell in love with this author's novel the long way to a small, angry planet.  In fact, readin' me review after all this time made me heart happy as I recaptured the feel of how great that book truly was.  While this book is the second book in the series, it actually can be read as a stand-alone, though I still recommend readin' them in order.

Whereas the first book followed multiple people traveling the universe with a purpose, this story follows two individuals in two locations. In alternating chapters, ye explore how one person's past influenced the present and then explore how the other person chooses to live their future.  The juxtaposition was poignant and absolutely engrossing.  I would actually be sad for a split second to switch perspectives and then become mesmerized once more.  The switching was deftly done and completely enriched this character driven story.  Both Pepper and Sidra have fascinating journeys.

Like in the first book, there are larger themes of friendship, identity, challenging prejudices, education, perseverance, and overcoming the circumstances of yer past to thrive.  This book was almost as good as the first.  So close.  I just wished the ending was different, but I am positive it is personal taste and that others will find it perfect.  So get this book and enjoy!",1515715200,5

So I thought it was high time I read the actual Dracula book by Bram Stoker, but I really wanted to listen too the audio book first. So I actually started reading Dracula on audio on libravox on September 28, 2017, but I really didn't like the audio on libravox. So I started to re-read from the very beginning on overdrive on November 30, 2017, which I prefer to hear the audio books on overdrive for now on. But I absolutely love and enjoy Dracula so much on overdrive it was so much better than on libravox in my opinion, but libravox is still a really good audio book source. Libravox is totally free and it has great classics books on it's list, I still say give it a try if you are looking for a totally free audio books for classic literature. Than libravox is for you! But anyways sorry I am getting side tracked here, let me get back too my review. Which I don't know what too write down, because I think every readers knows what Dracula is about. But I absolutely love and enjoy this great gothic horror book. I was on my toes and on the edge on my set reading throughout the whole book. I just felt horrible for poor Lucy and a character that I didn't even know that person exist in Dracula. I won't say who the character I am talking about is in case nobody has read Dracula before, but there is a side character that I absolutely love and adore. That I felt all the feels for that side character at the end of this book. I really enjoy the narration in this audio there were different people narrated it, but I just simply loved and enjoyed the different narration. I really didn't mind it at all. All and all I loved and enjoyed every bit of Dracula, that I hopefully will read more books by Bram Stoker in the near future!",1515801600,4

5703,767,1316,"Whether or not you have worked in corporate America or know the ins and outs of human resources (now known as talent management) Jillian Medoffs novel THIS COULD HURT is relatable. The story is a hilarious, tender, and sometimes sad look at the struggle is real in the brutal workforce during the 2008 financial crisis. The protagonist Rosa Guerrero is a powerhouse with a heart. Nearing 65, she is a self-made, self-taught woman who has risen the ladder in a world dominated by men, typically white men. A widow with no children, her office and staff are like family, by choice. Things at the multi-million dollar market research company in Manhattan have seen better days, but Rosa needs to keep appearances up and morale right alongside it.

She comes in coiffed, St. John-knitted, and blown-out, instilling confidence each day with the hope that this will rub off on her team. There are definitely more than a few who could use a boost. Slackers beware. They think because she is a generation away, she doesnt know what goes on, but she is all-knowing. When their fearless leader experiences some trouble, how will they function, what will they do.

Office crushes, inevitable problems at home that cross over to work, more online shopping than getting reports in on time, gaming when time would be better spent connecting with a client. Its a veritable soap opera or day care but the company is paying you, the adult, tocome in.

The cast of characters run the gamut and you will adore some, cheer for others, and either feel sorry for or hope they get let go because it is probably for the best. There are so many absolutely laugh out loud moments and really good behind-their-back names that you will roar remembering names that you and your work friends called your boss and how it helped get you through the day, or maybe still does help. Not coincidentally that many of the characters are in therapy and how I wished one of the therapists got more air time because he was so good that he could have his own book. Hint, hint, your next novel, Ms. Medoff.

The author has incredible insight of human behavior and is clearly an astute observer of the workplace*. Kudos to her on a fun, fast-paced, and entertaining read.",1515801600,5
5704,69,1316,"Jillian Medoff puts corporate America under a microscope in ""This Could Hurt,"" a smart and satirical novel set, for the most part, from 2009 to 2010. Rosa Guerrero, chief of Human Resources at Ellery Consumer Research, is tough, ambitious, and self-confident, but she also cares about her employees.  Unfortunately, with the economy is in free-fall, layoffs are inevitable.  As she observes, ""being chief at Ellery in 2099 was like running air traffic control during a typhoon."" Rosa and her boss, CEO Rutherford Beaumont, have tough decisions to make if Ellery is to remain viable.

The wonderful cover is worth mentioning.  It shows the picture of an employee termination form with check boxes. Each box is next to one word of the title.  The background color, orange, is cheery and upbeat, but the form, which is white with blue letters, is stark.  This design tells its own eloquent story: Even when life seems to be going well, your job may go up in smoke. All of a sudden, you are unemployed and back in the rat race. You find out what you already know--that  job hunting can be exhausting and demoralizing.

Thanks to Medoff's terrific descriptive writing and the time she takes to delve into each person's psyche, we grow to care about the characters, even those who are not particularly likeable. Rob Hirsch is happily married with two daughters, but he is underperforming at Ellery and in danger of being let go.  Leo Smalls is a lonely gay man who puts in long hours and is devoted to helping Rosa.  Lucy Bender, an upwardly mobile young woman, is bright, capable, and like Leo, unsuccessful in love.  Kenny Verville, a black man with an MBA from Wharton, has been coasting at Ellery until something better comes along.  When a crisis changes the situation at HR, Rosa, Leo, Lucy, Rob, and Kenny will all face formidable challenges.

This book is brilliantly constructed, with organizational charts that speak volumes; subplots about romances and relationships that flourish and fail; emotional meltdowns and visits to therapists; infighting; internal politics; tragedy; comedy; rejection; old friendships ended and new ones begun; and unexpected acts of kindness.  The people in ""This Could Hurt"" are in process of defining who they are and where they want to be five or ten years from now. While they struggle with existential issues, we are caught up in their personal and professional dramas that continue to play out until the very end. A clever epilogue wraps everything up in style in this excellent and original work of fiction by the gifted, compassionate, and insightful Ms. Medoff.",1515801600,5
5705,259,1026,"I have enjoyed other books by Ms Colgan.  Although this was part of a series, I felt that it worked well as a stand alone read.  Reading it without reading other books in the series was not a problem for me.

Polly and Huckle are a charming couple who live together and plan to get married some day.  She owns and runs a bakery in an island village on the coast of Cornwall.  He is a beekeeper who sells his honey and the wax from the hives.  She is English and he is an American.  She finds it difficult to be still.  He is a calm person who is very easy going.  They live in a lighthouse with a pet puffin, Neil.

Their best friends live nearby.  Kerensa is married to Reuben.  They are obscenely wealthy as opposed to Polly and Huckle who scrape by.

 I wanted to fall in love with this book.  It was a difficult thing for me to do.

The first half of the book seemed to drag for me.  There were too many descriptions of people and situations.  I felt everything was too wordy without a lot of action.

There was also a great deal of drama.  Polly's family situation with her distant mother and her unknown father.  Kerensa had a crisis of great proportions.  A puffin rescue site was in deep financial trouble.  A young man wanted to ask his indifferent girl friend to marry him.  As you can see, in the darkest part of winter, it felt as though there was darkness in people's lives as well.

My Thoughts:

This series is a favorite of mine even though I'm reading the books completely out of order at this point.  It's funny because I started with the first book like most readers would do and then jumped ahead to the 23rd book in the series.  Here I am now having finished the 24th book and even though I've read them out of order, this series has still become a personal favorite of mine.  What I love about these books is just the normal, every day feel to them (besides the fact that there is usually a murder or mystery involved).  I get so caught up with these characters and their lives - I find it just so fun to read about!  This book was different than the other two books that I've read in this series because a murder hasn't actually happened.  Instead Faith is asked to investigate and basically help prevent a murder from happening.  This book was really fun to read!  It had the feel of the game Clue - was it going to be Ms. Scarlett in the study with the candlestick?  I loved playing this game when I was younger so I was delighted that this book had that same kind of feel at times.  I do feel at times that I'm missing out a bit from not having read the previous books in this series.  The author throws out references here and there from those earlier books and it makes me want to have read them all.  It doesn't affect my enjoyment of the book overall, I just know that I'm missing things that I wouldn't if I had read those books as well.  It sure gives me a reason to work on catching up on this series in 2018!

Overall, I found this book to be another enjoyable addition to this mystery series!  I really enjoyed the set up for this book and thought that it added a different level of tension compared to other more typical mysteries that I have read.  I will say that there were a lot of other different storylines with this book that at first I had a hard time following along with.  Halfway through though, I was fully invested in each and eager to see how everything was going to turn out.  I would be remiss if I also didn't mention how much I enjoy the references to Faith's cooking in these books.  Mysteries that include food seem to be a favorite of mine that I can't get enough of!  I wish that I was half as good of a cook as Faith is!  I can easily recommend both this series and this book though!  I don't plan on waiting too long before I move on to book two in this series!

Bottom Line:  A solid mystery that added to my love of this series!

Holiday Wishes is a short novella with only 8 chapters + Epilogue, so it did not take me long to read at all.

I remember reading the first book in the series and being introduced to Sean ORiley. I definitely couldn't wait to find out, which lady would tame Sean.

Sean happens to be the best man for his brothers wedding and he has a bachelor weekend planned at a B&B with his friends and brother. Although, Sean is about to encounter Lottie Hartford, who he happened to have lost his virginity to in high school. He also kind of broke her heart.

Uh oh! In comes some drama between Sean and Lotti Hartford during the story because of their past. Lotti hasn't forgiven him and Sean is determined to make it up to her. Lotti though won't be mad at him for long in the story. 

If there is one thing I enjoyed about this story is how Sean and Lotti get a second chance at love.  I always love the second chance love stories.

Even though the story is a novella, it definitely as a great edition to the series because I got more with the previous characters. I also got to read Seans HEA and he definitely deserved one, even if Lotti didn't make it easy for him.

I give this book 4 stars and highly recommend it Contemporary Romance readers out there. Just because its a Christmas themed book does not mean you have to wait until next Christmas to read it. I do recommend reading the previous books first before reading the novellas in the series. Youll want to read the full novels of the happy couples in Holiday Wishes that are Seans family and friends.

Im really enjoying this series (but Ive said this before) and now Im counting down to the next book in the series.",1515801600,4

Beautiful Lawman by Sophie Jordan
Book Four of the Devil's Rock series
Publisher: Avon
Publication Date: December 26, 2017
Rating: 5 stars
Source: ARC sent by publicist

Summary (from Goodreads):

From the wrong side of the tracks and with most of her family in jail or dead, Piper Walsh is used to everyone in town thinking the worst about her. It doesnt seem to matter that shes worked hard to build a good life for herself. So she isn't surprised that when she comes into contact with Sweet Hills wildly irresistible, arrogant sheriff, Hale Walters, they're instant adversaries. Piper has nothing in common with the town golden-boy-turned-lawmanand she refuses to be a notch on his bedpost.

Despite rumors, Hale avoids fooling around with the women of Sweet Hill, many of whom are hoping to get him to the altar. But staying out of Pipers path is proving near impossible. The infuriating troublemaker clearly has no respect for his badge. As she continues to push his buttons, it becomes clear to Hale that he must either arrest Piperor claim her as his own.

What I Liked:

I've been extremely excited about this book ever since I'd heard that Jordan was contracted to write more books in the series. I'd read the first three books and absolutely loved them, especially the third one, which introduced us to Piper. There is one single interaction between Piper and Hale in Fury on Fire, and it's hilarious because Piper dumps ice water all over Hale's lap at the club she works at. Beautiful Lawman is Hale and Piper's story and it does not disappoint.

Piper Walsh is used to having a certain reputation, thanks to other members of her family. No one will hire her, so she's stuck working the bar at a club - which she hates. She has never had to do anything other than serve drinks, but she needs more money if she is going to continue to support her fifteen-year-old sister and herself. Hale Walters is the town sheriff who seems to have it in for Piper. To him, Piper is a troublemaker who keeps popping up on his radar. Neither of them want to admit it at first, but there is a simmering attraction between. They might dance around each other and infuriate each other, but there's no denying their need for each other.

Friends, this was such a good romance story. Some tropes: enemies to lovers, damsel in distress (kind of?). I personally don't mind the damsel in distress trope at all - sometimes, a girl needs saving and a guy is perfect for the job. We can't always save ourselves, and even if we can, it's nice that someone else is there to do so.

And the enemies to lovers trope - definitely one of my favorites! There's something about the animosity and the bickering and the tension that is so fun to read. All of that negative passion becoming positively charged passion can be exciting. Jordan pulls that off perfectly, in this book!

Hale was kind of a jerk in Fury on Fire, but not in an unforgivable way. He was clearly looking out for his sister Faith, and I can't fault him for that. In this book, he still has his golden-boy, commanding demeanor, but we see a lot more to him than his looks and his authoritative figure. He's a genuinely good guy, even if he completely misjudged Piper.

Piper is a sweetheart! She seems prickly on the outside, but she has a soft, good heart. She would do anything for her little sister, and didn't hesitate to raise her, even though she's almost as young as her sister. Piper hates her job and hates what she might have to do eventually, but she is a hard worker and a tough girl. Slowly, Hale sees the rose behind the thorns.

These two together are incredibly satisfying to watch! They butt heads every time and it seems like they don't get along. What is it about Piper that frustrates Hale? What is it about Hale that Piper can't seem to shake? I love this kind of slow-burn, antagonistic romance. The chemistry is seriously scorching, and this is probably one of the hottest books in the series. Great tension, great build-up.

But I also liked watching them fall for each other. It was sweet, seeing Hale ""rescue"" Piper time and again. To me it was lovely because Piper was so used to doing everything by herself, and doing everything for her sister. She needed someone to look out for and care for her, and Hale was there. Hale needed someone to push his buttons and rattle him, and that was Piper.

There is very little drama to this book, even at the climax. I was so happy about this because drama can ruin a book. No love triangles, no past boyfriend/girlfriend issues, no cheating, no surprise pregnancies. Definitely my kind of romance novel!

The ending was excellent! Endings of romance novels usually are, but this one was especially so. It kind of hints at the fifth book? Which I'm excited about. I hope the fifth book will be about Cruz, Piper's older brother!

What I Did Not Like:

I guess I only wish that the book was longer! I loved Hale and Piper's dynamic.

Would I Recommend It:

I really REALLY recommend this book, of all of the books in the series. This one is probably my favorite. It was steamy hot and so sweet and I have reread it several times already. I also recommend the other books in the series, especially Fury on Fire, but if you read any book from the series, try this one! Super hot contemporary romance, friends.

Rating:

5 stars. A rare 5 stars from me. Jordan's contemporary romance stories keep getting better and better. She really digs into her characters and brings out their flaws and their good qualities, and she masterfully pieces together the romance between the characters. I am so hoping there will be a fifth book about Cruz and some lucky lady!",1515801600,5
5711,941,589,"Splendid! Such an enjoyable little romp in a super distorted historical farce!

This book is a humorous look at history that didn't happen but it would have been awfully nice for the books namesake if it did. Firstly, you have to get past the sad, sad history of the really real Lady Jane Grey but if you can get that out of your mind and go with the alternate history, it is a funny silly story that is just one that you need to let yourself go and enjoy the ride (I read the book while listening to the audiobook. Yes, I have the book open and read each word as I listen, I'm weird like that, but the audiobook is really, really good so if you like them I highly recommend it). There are so many strange characters you meet along the way as well as historical figures and they are so well written! You also get a grand tour of old England during the book. It's also easy to forget that three writers were behind the scenes of this book due to the way the story just flows from page to page.  It's just a great story.

There are so many great reviews already out there about this book that are far better than anything I could come up with and I don't want to give anything away.  I think it's a book that can be enjoyed by younger readers all the up to the very max age one is willing to exist to. So, if it seems like one that you might have a slight interest in, you'll probably find you like it!  I sure did.",1515801600,4
5712,319,925,"At the start of WWI, there was a general feeling in Great Britain that it was a lark that would soon be over.  As men headed overseas to France and started battling in the trenches, the feelings soon changed to hopelessness.  Will they ever be able to return home?  Will they ever be able to have a Last Christmas in Paris?

Thomas Harding is spending one last Christmas in Paris in 1968.  With him is a collection of letters from World War I between Evie Elliot, her brother Will, Wills best friend Thomas Harding, and other friends and family.  As Thomas reads through the letters, he revisits the past, the heartache and loss of the war, and also the great love.

I love, love, loved Last Christmas in Paris.  I think epistolary novels are fun to read, its like discovering the story of your Grandparents told through their letters.  I loved the characters, especially Evie.  She lives a privileged youth growing up with Will and Thomas near London.  It all seems a lark when they first go off to war, but as the war progresses, Ellie longs to both become more involved and scared that she may never see Will and Thomas again.

When going off to war, Thomas feels like it will be over soon, but also doesnt want to settle into the family business of running a newspaper.  Only when he is overseas does he realize the importance of the paper and his father, and also the importance of his friend Wills little sister.

I also appreciated that the novel faced a serious problem, PTSD or shell shock as they called it then, squarely on and talked about it as a major part of the story.

Favorite Quotes:

Life is forever changed without her without the sense of her somewhere near.  Empty hours wander by as I listen for the soft tread of her football on the stair and wait for her laugher to cheer these lifeless rooms.  When I close my eyes I can conjure her; the scent of her perfume, the feather-touch of her fingertips against my cheek, those intense blue eyes looking back at me.  But it is all illusion.  Smoke and mirrors that conceal the truth of her absence.

A new year lies ahead.  Though I am losing hope every day that I will ever return to England in one piece  or at all  at least time marches forward, paying no heed to the follies of men.

Overall, The Last Christmas in Paris is a wonderful novel of love, life, and war.  I highly recommend it!

For anyone like this reviewer who has not heard much of the Dreyfus affair, the book is an eye-opener. While it is assumed that ego-driven politicians and army generals have caused immense grief to many innocents for centuries, the extent of their bigoted, arbitrary incrimination and the subsequent, coordinated cover-up in this affair is breathtaking. Equally breath-taking are Picquart and a small band of men's years-long heroic and nearly selfless travails to uncover. Given how much injustice in our world is never revealed and reversed, one is almost relieved by the end that some justice is done in a society somewhat open to dwell on its own mistakes. Yet, one is simultaneously repelled by the biases that caused it.

Here is a historical fiction that is fictional only in the details and narration. Mr Harris does a wonderful job in acing his part, ie vivifying the events and adorning them with the descriptions and dialogues appropriate for modern English readers, while leaving the facts be. I am sure there are many subtle embellishments, as there are new characters and author's own bases/interpretations, but they remain subtle enough to materially change what must have been. The author's influence is particularly the greatest in dialogues, interactions and descriptions that tell the story.",1515801600,4

5722,359,1745,"A unique book. Macabre, gruesome, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, whimsical, wistful, it is a ""noir Western"" set in 19th century Oregon and California. The narrator is the second-ranked and younger of the two contract-killer brothers, pegged correctly as having a touch of the poet to him. There is a zen-like acceptance of the misfortunes inflicted by him and on him which, in the context of North American writing, feels Canadian - as indeed the author is, and justiably the winner of Canada's top literary prizes for this work.

That said, you have to be in the right mood for the book - the first time I started it, feeling crisp and logical, I couldn't get past the first page. A month later, in the mood for magical realism, I fell into it easily and was completely absorbed.",1515801600,5

He made a good effort at the end trying to make meaning of the story.  It is a book about relationships (most of them bad) between family members and relationships between friends and acquaintances (also mostly bad).  I stuck with it, because I thought I was missing something, and it would get better.  I wasn't, and it didn't.",1515801600,2
5724,650,354,"Okay, I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did. Like, I knew the moment that Percy burst on the scene, I was like YESSSSSSSSSS. PERCY TIME. I'M GOOD TO GO. And then I find two more new characters and MY BABIES COACH HEDGE AND LEO HAVE VAMOOSED THE BOOK SCENE??? I was thinking this was going to be a bumpy ride...and it totally wasn't.

I have to say that I was loving Percy missing his memory. Like, it felt so cool to get all the hidden things snuck in there about the previous series and be over here like, HAHA JUST YOU WAIT, PERCY. I loved how little snippets of his memory would come back, but how he still went with the new camp and making new friends. Percy is still one of the best characters that I've ever seen in YA, and this book really shone because of him. Even though he didn't know quite who he was, he still was Percy.

The new characters.......okay, I have some conflicting thoughts. I was super hesitant about both of them. I mean, it took me forever to warm up to Piper and Jason, AND NOW RIORDAN GIVES ME TWO NEW ONES. HOW DARE HE. I'm still super iffy about Frank. Like, I felt I wanted more from him. I liked his personal growth story and more about accepting himself, but I just felt...I didn't feel a lot about him. I'm interested to see how he is in the next few books, because I feel like I could really grow to like him but right now he's just so meh.

As the book went on, I really grew to like Hazel. At the beginning, I did feel like eh about her, but as the story went, there was just something about her that I just really began to love. She is so deep for a 13 year old, and she just had this aura of cool, fierce female that was going to do anything for those she loved. Her relationship with Nico was something interesting to see, and gosh, I felt for her so much. Same thing with her mother, and she has a passion for horses, SO YAYAYAY FOR ANOTHER YA CHARACTER HAVING A PASSION.

I also love how much more diverse these books are getting. I mean, we had some diversity in the first series (lol not much, tho, if I'm being honest), but we keep getting more and more diverse main characters in these books, and I'm just so excited about that.

I also really enjoyed the new characters that were brought in from Camp Jupiter. Um, Octavian might be my favorite villain of all time? I was crying the first time we met him, and I just feel like he's one of the villains that will want to be taking over the world but you just can't take them seriously. Ella is fantastic, and TYSON AND HER MIGHT GO DOWN AS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHIPS. PLEASE LET IT BE A THING. The other characters were intriguing as well, and I did get some new loves of the ghost, Villerius or however he spells it and the god of boundaries. Riordan just a way with characterization even for the smallest parts in the book.

Where I stumbled a bit was with the plot sometimes. For the first...maybe 20% of the book, I just wasn't feeling it. It was an overwhelming feeling of, oh gosh, we're not doing this again. Like, do I really have to go through another character getting acquainted to a camp with no memory and a bunch of new characters that I have no stake in the game with? However, as time went on, I really started to not care and I became invested again in our new characters and their quest. Soon enough,I was blowing through every chapter to find out what was going to happen and the last 20% was so many five crowns for me. Although I did feel at the end, the plot got a little disjointed because I felt like there was just a million plots being added on for the rest of the series and I was like oh, kk, I got it and then I was like oh, wait another thing, and then I was like WAIT WHAT EVEN MORE, NO WONDER THE NEXT FEW BOOKS ARE GIANTS.

Overall, I definitely think this was a great addition to the Percy name and this new series. I was so hesitant about this book when I was first starting since I thought for sure it would just be a copy of the first book in the series. However, Riordan found a way to make it creative and new, and he introduced us to a bunch of new characters that were enjoyable. I'm still waiting on Frank a bit, but I really like Hazel. Super excited to see where this leads next...since there really is a million of different plots that it could go! Four crowns and an Ariel rating!",1515801600,4

5726,731,19,"Epic. This series is epic. I am so in love with this series and the world and the characters. I don't think Ive ever read anything quite like it. On its face its a high fantasy but its also a dystopian or maybe sci fi or historical. It doesnt fit into one box and I love it all the more for that.

Kelsea is an incredible heroine and she has grown so much from the first book. I love her strength and tenacity and her devotion to her people. She truly cares about them and is willing to do what needs to be done. What I liked in this one is that Kelsea flirts with danger in this one and skirts a line of right and wrong but she always seems to come out stronger in the end. She is a true fighter.

And the book wouldnt be what it is without the secondary characters. I love love love Lazarus and I want to know everything there is to know about him. Pen holds my heart and is my absolute favorite. Aisa is tough as nails and I love this little girl. Glee is adorable and Andalie is so loyal. And of course I still want to know more about the mysterious Fetch.

The plot in this one kept me on my toes and so much caught me off guard. And I loved getting some backstory about the Crossing and what not. There were so many layers to this story and I love how seemingly disconnected things all wove together as part of one larger story. There is so much going on and I cant wait to get my answers.

I didn't know it was a fantasy book or else I might now have wanted to read it since that isn't my favorite genre.  While I didn't fall in love with it initially, I will say that it sort of grabbed me towards the end.  To the author's credit, she has a wonderful imagination that does grip you.  Le Cirque de Reves is a mysterious circus that only opens at night. It is completely monochromatic featuring only black, white and greys in its color scheme, with towering tents of varying shapes and sizes, an elaborate wrought-iron fence, and sign painted in white letters that reads ""Opens at Nightfall, Closes at Dawn"" . For me, once I knew that the circus and its inhabitants lives were dependent on the circus surviving, I found myself rooting for the circus.

It is clear she has a direction and a purpose behind every twist, but I am often too busy being shocked to even have a guess about where it is all going.  I highly recommend this series and I happily give it 5 stars.

I love all of the things we begin to learn about the sisters personality and the men they fall in love with.

5735,614,309,"This book focuses on 3 main characters, in the POV of Monty. A wealth, entitled, and over all awful Englishman. He and his company are embarking on a tour across Europe before his sister is enrolled in finishing school, his best friend leaves for Holland, and Monty is given part of the family business ( which he isn't exactly thrilled about ). Due you Monty's unique personality, his father has enlisted the service of a chaperone to accompany them.

Despite the chaperone, Monty makes a single impulsive and very poorly thought out decision that completely derails the direction that ever single character was meant to follow. Their safe and well mapped out year abroad is completely turned upside down, and what was laid out to be a novel about underclass young adults on tour becomes something immensely different.

I didn't love the book, but after the effort to get through to the turning point, I didn't hate it. I came to love Monty's sister, and really like his love interest. I feel like the story really picked up somewhere around the halfway point and even more so towards the final quarter. I found I was genuinely interested to see what would happen to these characters.

Despite the slow beginning I will give kudos where it is due; this was a really easy book to read and move through. Even without 100% interest in it, I was still able to pick it up at least once a day and jump into it without dragging my feet too terribly.

Author: Adam Silvera

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Contemporary Fiction

Series: Standalone

Star Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

The book club buddy that recommended Stalking Jack the Ripper to me begged me to read this. It was already in my library stack, and she specifically asked that I read one of her recommendations, since shed already checked out several titles Id sent her way. I pushed it up to the top of the stack, drawn to the moody, beautiful, blue and purple cover. It was a gorgeous, beautiful, and painful story of dying and truly living, not taking your time for granted, and it gutted me totally. It ripped apart my heart and soul and sewed it back together again, and I will never forget it. Hands down, one of the best books of 2017, and Adam Silvera has become one of my new favorite authors! Heart-wrenching, tender, and hopeful, They Both Die at the End is a lovely reminder to livenot just survivewhile you still have the time to do so.

The novel is set in a not-so-distant future, where virtual reality is the norm and an organization called DeathCast has been formed to tell people of their last twenty-four hoursliterally. And Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio have gotten that dreaded last call. They meet through an app called Last Friend, and, forced to take a chance on each other during their last hours, they form a deep bonda bond that lasts all the way until the end. Told from multiple points of view throughout the same day, Silvera reminds usgently, and not so much, later onto not take our time on this earth for granted, and to fully live while we still can. Its one of those beautifully awful tearjerkers that worms into your heart, breaks into your soul, and dominates your thoughts. I finished it yesterday and Im still reeling; I had to take most of the day to process my feelings. But Adam Silvera has cemented a permanent place in my heart, and I cant wait to check out more of his work when I get a chance.

Honestly, even before this was recommended to me, I was drawn to the beautiful cover, even knowing what would happen at the end. Then my buddys plea to read it just clinched it for me. I went into it not knowing what to expect, but I really enjoyed it, even with all of the emotional pain. It was beautifully written, greatly paced between the boys and the other characters who are affected by the miraculous DeathCast. I really liked the way it went between Mateo, Rufus, and all of the other characters; it settled into a rhythm that was really nice once the book got going. I loved all of the characters, too, every single one of them, and the prose was gorgeous and tender and seemed to squeeze every last bit of my heart. And when the ending finally cameand I tried to put it off for as long as I couldI felt gutted, cleaned out, at least emotionally. I cried for a good day and a half, and its still lingering with me, even now as I write these words. But Adam Silvera has become one of my new favorite authors, and I will be checking out more of his work as soon as I possibly can. One of the best books of 2017, even while it destroyed me in the best kind of way! The bottom line: A gorgeous, beautiful and tender reminder to live to the fullest while you still can, They Both Die at the End is one of the best books of 2017, and one that I will never forget!

5745,833,819,"Agoraphobia is an intense fear and anxiety of being in places where it is hard to escape, or where help might not be available. Agoraphobia usually involves fear of crowds, bridges, or of being outside alone.

Extreme agoraphobic Anna hasn't left her house in months. Instead, she lives alone popping pills like candy, drinking bottles of wine...and watching her neighbors. She knows their names, who is cheating on who, and their daily routines. When a new family moves in across the street, Anna becomes fixated on this mysterious new family. When she meets the son, Ethan, she forms a mental attachment to them, especially after meeting and befriending the wife, Jane.

When Anna hears a scream and then sees Jane stabbed and bloody, she immediately calls the police. When the police think she's a drunk that's making things up for attention, and everyone denies that anything happened, Anna starts to wonder whether or not she can trust herself...

I heard so much about The Woman in the Window before I got around to reading my copy, so I was really excited to read it! Part of me was worried about how hyped up it was, because as I'm sure you all know, that can sometimes lead to disappointment. I'm glad to say that this was not the case for me while reading this book!

The Woman in the Window features an unreliable and unlikeable narrator, along the same lines as The Girl on the Train, so if you liked that book you'll definitely want to check this one out! While I was rooting for Anna, I also wanted to shake her until she got her life together!

While reading the book, I had so many questions - where is Anna's family? What happened to her that caused her to be agoraphobic? Why does she spy on her neighbors? I was able to guess quite a bit of the ending and resolution, but I didn't completely solve the mystery! There are multiple twists and turns throughout the story, which I really enjoyed, and ultimately all of my questions were answered in due time.

While the book was a mystery and did have a thriller aspect to it, it didn't really pick up for me until the last third or so of the book, and at that point I didn't want to put it down and ended up staying up too late to finish the book! All in all, I rated the book 4 stars, and would recommend this one to fans of thrillers with narrators who are flawed. I'd like to thank Edelweiss, William Morrow, and A.J. Finn for an advanced copy of the book. It was my pleasure to provide an honest review.",1515888000,4

5747,579,819,"A very engaging, character driven psychological thriller.

SUMMARY
Anna Fox, once a well respected child psychologist, has not left her house in almost a year. She has become an agoraphobic, she physically and mentally cannot make herself leave her house. Separated from her husband and daughter (the book is initially vague about the reason for the separation but progressively reveals all), she becomes fixated on the comings and goings of her neighbors. She spends an unhealthy amount of time watching them from her front window and self medicating by mixing large quantities of wine with her prescription drugs. One day she sees something horrible but when she reports it to the police, they doubt her word, as does most of the neighborhood. Is she imagining things or are her neighbors across the park excellent liars?

WHAT I LOVED
I love stories with unreliable narrators and Anna totally fits that bill! I spent over half the book wondering whether or not she was imagining the whole thing. She was not exactly credible.

I also love flawed, complex characters. Anna certainly proves to be flawed and extremely complicated, yet still manages to be sympathetic. Based on her actions, it's easy to see how her neighbors and the police could doubt her interpretation of events. As far as the other characters in the book, mostly various neighbors, none of them are without flaws.

I loved the NYC setting, particularly how the neighbors could see each other through their windows across the park. I also loved how the older couple, the Wasserman's ( I think?) resented the gentrification of their neighborhood. It felt very authentic. Only in a place like NYC would people be that close, so watchable and the phenomena of the variance between what the neighborhood used to be versus what it is becoming is a big part of such places.

I liked the way the book is structured. It is written in only one point of view, yet the reader unsure if they are getting the real story.  It's very much a character driven plot. The chapters are short and easy to read.

I think my favorite feature about the book is the way the setting, plot and characters all work together to create the mood and feel of the book. It was so well done. You have an admittedly depressed and possibly unstable woman wandering around alone in this dark, old, rambling house. About 80% of the book takes place in this house. The house is in NYC, it's late fall so it's starting to get cold and rain a lot. Anna doesn't sleep regularly so sometimes she sleeps quite a bit of the day away and is awake late at night. Anna spends a lot of time watching old black and white classic movies and has a penchant for Hitchcock, which is interesting because the book reminded me a lot of 'Rear Window.'  It feels dark and depressing with a hint of danger lurking around the corner. You can almost hear the theatrical 'scary' music in the background. All of this keeps the reader off balance, making them wonder what is real and what is just going on inside Anna's head.

There are a couple big twists. The first one wasn't a big surprise but the final one blew me away! Loved it.

WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE
I liked the book a lot but there are a couple things about it that made it drop to 3.5 stars versus giving it a higher rating.

The plot moved very slowly in a few places, I lost patience with it a couple times. I understand the author did this intentionally to show how slowly time was passing for Anna, but it was a bit much for me.

The first big twist was almost identical to one in another book I read not long ago so it didn't have the effect it would have had otherwise. It wasn't the big 'holy crap' moment it was intended to be. It almost felt borrowed. It did, however, explain why Anna was such a basket case.

Early on, the book indicates that Anna did something big which damaged her marriage, causing the separation from her family. When the reader finally discovers what her misdeeds were, it didn't ring true. It never delved into any explanation as to why she would do something of that nature and it seemed at odds with her personality and feelings about her husband and marriage. I wish author, A. J. Finn has gone into more detail on that point. I really needed to understand why she would risk everything she held dear, I needed an explanation.

Things seem to get even worse when she realizes that Dax miller, a classmate of hers, is locked in with her. Though she knows little about Dax, the rumors regarding him, plus his history in Juvie and loner status, peg him has trouble. Plus, he doesn't seem interested in Autumn's companionship during their time locked in the library.

However, they soon begin forging an unlikely freindship, opening up to eachother and eperiencing a strong connection...one that is threatened when they are back to the real world and Autumn is back to her life which includes an almost-boyfriend who has been seriously injured and is in the hosptial. Will she be able to maintain a friendship with Dax? Will she want more? Or will Jeff , plus Dax's desire to remain unattached, win?

This was my first book by Kasie West and I thoroughly enjoyed this sweet contemporary. It was a fast and fun read that had a sound plot, solid and lovable protaganists, as well as some decent anxiety representation,

I would say my only true issue with the story was the whole Jeff subplot as it only served to create an unnecessary almost-love traingle. Jeff had been Autumn's long-time love interest before her time in the library. Though she flashed back to some of the times she had spent with Jeff, he is really not a huge focus for the first third of the book and we don't get to know him. Then, when they are rescued and Autumn finds out Jeff is hurt, suddenly we are supposed to care about this character and appreciate Autumn's connection to him.

Overall, it just seemed overtly unnecessary. especially when in the end...*Spoiler Alert*... Autumn realizes her feelings for Dax are real, her feeling for Jeff were unfounded, and Jeff ultimately just reacts in an ""it is what it is"" way and ultimately proves to be no obstacle.

5752,647,957,"Asha broke the rules as a child, she told the forbidden stories in the hills outside her city and it drew the attention of Kozu, the most powerful dragon in the kingdom. When she stopped giving him the stories he wanted Kozu flew into a rage, nearly burning Asha to death and destroying half of the city with a rain of fire. Ever since then Asha has been haunted by what happened and has desperately tried to make amends to her people by hunting and destroying the dragons. If she can only find and defeat Kozu her people will be safe and she might even be able to avoid the arranged marriage between her and the commander of her father's army, Jarek.

I love dragons so of course any book about them automatically ends up on my wish list but I have to admit I was a little disappointed when the opening scene starts with Asha capturing a dragon and cutting it's head off - I prefer my dragons as regal allies rather than vicious enemies! Luckily it doesn't take long to figure out there is much more to this story than a one girl mission to kill as many dragons as possible though. Asha is a complicated character, she knows her father hates the old stories but they are a way for her to feel close to the mother she lost as a young girl so they bring a comfort to her even when she knows they could cost her everything. We get to learn snippets of these stories at the beginning of each chapter and they're well worth paying attention to because they give us hints at what is really going on in the rest of the story.

Asha isn't the easiest character to like in the beginning, she's very stubborn and quite closed off to those around her but she's had to become that way to guard herself after everything that happened when she was a child. The entire city blame her for what happened to them and people look at her with fear and hatred wherever she goes so she has no choice but to brazen it out rather than crumble under their disapproval. She goes on a real emotional journey throughout the story learning to trust her own instincts and to question everything she's always been told about both her past and the dragons. I really enjoyed the changes in her and admired the way she stood up for what she believed in even when the price of failure would be so high.

Her only allies have been her brother Dax and her cousin Safire. For much of the story Dax seemed pretty useless but he actually has his own secrets and becomes much more interesting as you start to uncover what is going on with him, I'm really hoping we'll see more of his side of the story as the series continues. Safire was a very positive influence on Asha, she's been treated terribly because of her heritage but she's fierce and determined and she's Asha's biggest ally. Then you have Torwin, the slave boy who Asha frees at great personal risk to herself. He's another great character and one who has an important role to play in showing Asha the truth of what is really going on around her.

The Last Namsara is a brilliant debut and although it doesn't end on a cliffhanger I'm eager to dive back into his world to find out what happens next. Kristen Ciccarelli is definitely an author to watch out for.",1515888000,4
5753,962,379,"His books are always very informative and a quick and enjoyable read.  This one is no exception.  He details the story of the club and their dam, how it was not well maintained, and once it broke, manages to spell out to the reader what happened almost to the level of some individuals.  It was as if he was there taking notes. Of course, it was constructed from observations of the survivors, but he puts it together in a very concise and clear way.  The book has photographs that allow one to see the power of the flood. And the topography of the river magnifies the floodwaters.",1515888000,4
5754,527,198,"Aside from the Cliffs notes version presented on the TV show, Wishbone, I knew enough about Don Quixote to be dangerous without having actually read it. After all, this book has spawned such words and phrases as tilting at windmills and quixotic, as well as a Broadway musical. But how does this 17th-century classic hold up in todays world? One would argue that chivalry was already dead by the time it was written, so its not likely to be an examination of chivalrous attitudes and how theyd benefit society. As far as I see it, Don Quixote is a bit like a romantic comedy in the vein of William Shakespeares plays.

Probably the first-ever recorded instance of a dedicated live action role player (LARPer), the character Don Quixote borders on that line between comedy and tragedy. If I were to give a medical explanation for his actions, its either severe delusion and dementia or a high-functioning psychosis. And yet, his dedication to his chivalrous quest is charming if not slightly amusing when he comes face-to-face with reality. The fact that many characters go along with his delusion to work out some relationship issues shows that this book enjoys the lighthearted nature of chivalrous nostalgia.

When it comes right down to it, Don Quixote is a comedy of errors. The long series of mistakes and awkward situations brought about by the titular characters delusion merely highlights the contrast between the fictional worlds of the books that influenced his demeanor and the real world around him. In fact, one would almost say the moral of this story is being able to distinguish fiction from reality, of which Don Quixote is unable to do. Such as it is, Don Quixote is a fun read, especially if you don't try to read too much into it.

A comedy with some potential takeaways, I give Don Quixote 4.0 stars out of 5.",1515888000,4
5755,167,1751,"Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, known by many as the Father of Motivation, passed away in 2015, but left a legacy of more than 40 books on self-development. This book was his first, first published in 1976, and has sold 35 million copies worldwide.

I came across this book by reference and had to read it. And it was obvious in just the first few pages why it has been such a longstanding sensation. Its uplifting without the cotton fluff sometimes found in books of the genre. Its very reassuring, but he certainly pulls no punches. His is brass knuckle realism all the way.

The book is a primer on living in the moment and the importance of choice. Its all about choosing your way out of regret, worry, and self-abasement. While its good advice even today, it had to be well ahead of its time in 1976.

He promises a lot. Im not sure that I can think my way to turning the sound of the dentists drill into the most orgiastic moment of your life, but I certainly accept the underlying premise. And he makes some very insightful points about learning, noting, for example, that the average test results among school children are not far off the best test results from a couple of grades back, suggesting that the knowledge gained at school is a function of time rather than innate talent. It makes sense.

It does seem that the in the moment movement is getting somewhat displaced by the concept of understanding who you are in the larger context of your greater purpose in the self-development genre, but the idea has not been discredited for sure. I just think that comments such as, There is no such thing as human nature, while true in a figurative sense, perhaps, might raise some objection from contemporary evolutionary biologists and others in the field of science and psychology.

The people who live in the moment clearly have a very transparent and absolute perspective on the world. Justice is a simply a concept that has almost no applicability, particularly as it pertains to your own choices about fulfillment and happiness. Again, true at some conceptual level, but not the way most of us would choose to live today. We tend to be less absolute and more relative in our values, largely because of the increasing complexity of life in an age of technology, even though that relativity introduces some conflict in our lives.

All told, its a very quick and easy read and you will learn a lot. I particularly enjoyed his thoughts on parenting, which all of us who have attempted it know we got wrongor at least not completely right.",1515888000,4

Everyone has come, a large contingent from the local Catholic church, tons of policemen who the dad, Fix Keating, works with, family members and even guys from the District Attorney's office.  It's a large party that spreads throughout the house and yard.  At the end of it, something has happened that will insure that things will never be the same.

Sometime during the party, Burt Cousins, a local D.A. meets Beverly Keating, the mother of the baby.  Sparks are apparent immediately and before the party is over, the two share a lingering kiss.  This kiss sparks a family tragedy as the two families are broken up.  Burt who has four children and Beverly, with her two girls, each divorce and they marry each other and move to Virginia.

There are now six children involved.  Over the years, they get to know each other and share summer vacations and irritation at their parents.  The novel follows each family over the decades.  Marriages come and go, there is a death that traumatizes everyone and the six children and their parents do a dance in which they come closer and then move farther apart, over and over.  When Franny is in her twenties she has an affair with a celebrated writer.  He takes the stories she has told him about her family and turns it into a successful novel that exposes all the family secrets and forms the basis of new relationships that are now built on truths long hidden.

Ann Patchett has a long history as a celebrated writer.  She has won both an Orange Prize for her novel Bel Canto and a PEN/Faulkner award.  Under her accomplished guidance, the reader learns about the Keating and Cousins families and how they are blended and torn asunder.

Two young adults from London end up at the same American boarding school. One a female defendant of Sherlock Holmes the other a male descendant of John Watson. Cool coincidence? Doubtful. Charlotte Holmes and Jaime Watson are being framed for murder. Or more than one murder and maybe some other crimes that border felony charges.

5760,1057,1752,"Port Elizabeth in South Africa is booming.  The rise of bioengineering means an easier life for most people.  Each has his own personal assistant in the form of a robot.  Of course the animals of Africa have disappeared, but there are replacements which were engineered in labs and can recall the glory of the former animals.  In fact, some animals were engineered and reproduced so prolifically that the streets are overwhelmed with dik-diks roaming about interfering with traffic and harassing tourists.

But everything is not positive.  Underneath the facade of progress, a centuries-old demigoddess is shepherding her strength, feeding occasionally on humans and taking new energy and strength from their bodies.  It is unclear who can stand up to her but her plans include killing off the majority of humans who she sees as weak and superfluous and whose deaths make her ever stronger.

Yet there are those who can oppose her.  Muzi is a teenager obsessed with rugby and perhaps falling in love with his best friend, but lately he is starting to feel that he can influence the thoughts and actions of others.  He has an innate connection with the personal robots around him and helps them cross into being individual functioning beings.  Riya Natrajan is a spoiled female superstar; her songs known far and wide and her fans obsessed with her, not knowing about her weaknesses and her hidden strengths she is herself just starting to realise.  Stoker is a politician whose dream has always been to be on the stage like his idol Riya and he is willing to give up politics for the chance to be her backup singer.  Then there is Nomvula, a little girl who may be the most powerful of all.  She is starting to discover the depth of her powers but is unsure if she is to use these powers for good or for evil.

The battle is set and plays out in the arena of a superstar concert.  Thousands have arrived to hear the music but will they emerge unscathed?  Evil and good will struggle and everything will be on the line; the outcome uncertain at best.  Who will emerge victorious?

Nicky Drayden is a brilliant new voice on the science fiction/fantasy spectrum.  She is a system analyst herself so the parts about robots and artificial intelligence ring true.  She has found prior success as a short story author and her debut novel has also garnered praise from many quarters. The plotting and pace of the book, alternating each character's story while advancing the plot, makes for an exciting read.  This book is recommended for science fiction readers.",1515974400,4
5761,711,1728,"There is good news and bad news for fans of the husband-and-wife author team known as Nicci French. The bad news is that their long-running series featuring consulting psychologist Frieda Klein is ending. This is not entirely unexpected, given that the title of the introductory book was BLUE MONDAY and the names of subsequent novels have proceeded in an orderly fashion through the week. The good news is that the series is not concluding with the newly published SUNDAY SILENCE, which is intended to be the penultimate title, to be followed in the summer by the grand finale.

If this latest effort is any indication, Team French intends to leave Friedas London on a creative high note as they continue to constructively tinker in different ways with the structure of the traditional mystery.

SUNDAY SILENCE begins with the grisly discovery of a body buried beneath the floorboards of a living room in a London home. This would be shocking enough in any case, but the home in question is Friedas and the discovery is made by her good friend, Josef, the enigmatic construction worker whose presence constitutes one of the many interesting threads that has run through these seven books.

The police are brought in, of course, and Frieda ever so briefly becomes a person of interest due to the location of the body and its identity. It becomes clear, though, that the doer is none other than Dean Reeve, the killer who is supposed to have died several years before. Frieda, to the chagrin of the police, has been insisting that Reeve is alive and stalking her, and the discovery of the corpse and some other evidence demonstrates that she has been right all along.

However, the news inspires a copycat whose actions are directed at Frieda through those whom she cares about. These actions escalate over the course of the novel, and it is apparent that he is working toward some sort of grand finale for reasons that gradually become clear, but only after his identity is revealed to the reader. Yes, French pulls off a neat trick here, turning SUNDAY SILENCE from a mystery into a thriller about halfway through the book, with cat-and-mouse elements where the roles keep getting switched. Where does it all lead? The answer to that question is a grand and mysterious last sentence that no doubt will lead directly into that final volume I mentioned previously.

This series developed into one of my favorites almost from its inception, and the prospect of seeing the off-kilter Frieda and the wonderful cast of supporting characters --- good, bad and ugly --- fade off into the sunset in the next volume is a sad one. Friedas prickly personality guarantees that she won't leave quietly, but there is a depth to her that hasn't quite been plumbed yet. Newcomers to the series can and should read SUNDAY SILENCE, then go back and catch up on what has gone before while waiting for the concluding installment. Meanwhile, those who have been aboard this well-maintained train from the beginning will find a cornucopia of reasons to love this next-to-last visit.

5763,1057,59,"World-renowned mystery writer Alan Conway has finished his latest mystery.  That's the news that awakes book editor Susan Ryeland when she returns from a business trip.  She takes the manuscript home for the weekend and is soon thoroughly engrossed as she is a big fan of the series, although not necessarily the author himself.  She didn't hit it off to him so her partner has always handled him.  She gets to the end of the manuscript and realizes that the ending chapters are missing and there is no solution.  Ah well, some mistake must have happened and she'll get it straight on Monday.

Monday comes but there is no solution.  Instead, there is the shocking news that Conway has died in a fall at his home.  Susan's partner, Charles, gets a letter from Alan which is basically a suicide note and the police are ready to mark it down as one.

But when Susan goes to Alan's house to look for the missing chapters, she starts to wonder if Alan has really killed himself or if someone else has done it.  The more she looks into his life, the more she realizes what a totally unpleasant person Alan is.  There are tons of suspects if its a murder; the boyfriend who was about to be pushed aside, the former wife and son who were shocked when Alan wanted a divorce to come out as gay, the neighbor who was involved in a dispute with Alan, the vicar who remembered him as a bully and the former student who claimed Alan stole his book idea.  With all the suspects, can it really be anything but murder?

Anthony Horowitz has written a stunningly good mystery novel.  The concept of writing a book within a book is unique and draws the reader in.  As Susan's investigation deepens, it soon appears that anyone who knew Alan had a reason to wish him gone.  The reader will turn the last pages satisfied to have resolved both the novel murder and the real-life one.  This book is recommended for mystery readers.",1515974400,5
5764,621,957,"The Last Namsara is Kristen Ciccarelli's debut novel and I am in love. The world building was brilliantly done and laid a strong foundation for her story to grow and develop.

Asha is a dragon hunter and a feared Iksari who is strong and dedicated to her role in the kingdom. Despite the fact that her actions as a child called the dragons who burned her city, she fights every day to redeem herself from her past mistakes and make her father, the King, proud. It was nice to see the main character learns to value herself, even though she has grown up shamed and feared by the people. She overcomes her prejudices and the damage instilled upon her over the course of the novel.

Her transformative journey begins when a slave, Torwin is introduced to her life. He treats her like a normal person, just as she learns to treat him as one. He opens her eyes to the truth of the world and thaws her damaged heart, leading her to learn so much about the people in her kingdom and a better way to live.

There was also a well-written antagonist who was so controlling and cruel that you couldn't help but hate him. It was a nice juxtaposition to Torwin's character and helped push the plot along. For me, the romance was a secondary plot point and sometimes only slowed down the pacing. It wasn't the most important element of the story.

The world building, mythology and the dragons are what shone for me. I cannot wait to see more of this world. I listened to this via audiobook and the narrator, Pearl Mackie did a fantastic job. I loved the authenticity she brought to Asha's character and would highly recommend this audiobook.",1515974400,4
5765,621,417,"They Both Die at the End. That tells you exactly what is going to happen in the book, yet you hope the entire time that it won't be true. This book made me so happy and sad. The journey was hopeful despite the dark theme and you really connect with the characters. This was my first Adam Silvera novel and I am definitely interested in reading more of his books now.

I also listened to the audiobook for this, rather than physically reading it. I really enjoyed the two narrators who voiced the main characters, Mateo and Rufus. Both Silvera's words and the narrator's execution made the characters come to life. My one negative for the narration was the women who voiced the supporting characters when the chapters switched to their points of view.

I would have been happy with the story being told from just Mateo and Rufus' points of view. Some of the alternative viewpoints added an interesting note to the story or helped weave seemingly unrelated events and lives together, but I didn't feel that they were all relevant and occasionally took me out of the story.

I felt that the two main characters were very well fleshed out and seemed like teenage boys living out their last day. Mateo's anxiety was unique and nicely represented. I also loved that this was an own voices novel, so there was diversity and representation. The novel completely revolves around these two and it's perfect that way. I also feel that Silvera's side characters were decently developed, you could see that they were each unique people but they weren't so detailed that they took away from Mateo and Rufus' stories.

Honestly, even though you know what's coming the book manages to keep you completely emotionally engaged and on your toes. Right in the beginning of the book one of Rufus' friends starts to cry because he didn't get to hug his best friend. It was so sad, so soon and we hadn't even experienced hundreds of pages of development and heart-string tugging yet. I knew right then that I was in for a book that would have an affect.

I am not entirely sure how I feel about the world-building. The contemporary aspects of it were fantastic and I could completely see each place that the two visited. It was the Death-Cast aspect of it that felt a little flimsy to me. I think that part of the story is the mystery of it, but I do wish we learned more. It one of the few things that I felt could be improved in this book.

I really enjoyed this read and would highly recommend it if you like character-driven novels and don't mind a good cry at the end..",1515974400,4
5766,621,309,"The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue is a hilarious romp through the 1700's. Monty is a well-off, yet rakish gentleman who is sent off of a Grand Tour of Europe with his best friend, Percy and his sister, Felicity. Three the manage to, of course, get into trouble and a wonderfully fun journey for the reader ensues. This light, humorous, historical fiction read is a must - even if you don't think you're normally a historical fiction person.

Monty is quite enamored with himself and unconcerned about the responsibility that his title infers that he should possess. He doesn't think through his actions and gets in more trouble than the pretty face of his would lead you to believe. Despite that, and despite his absolute ineptitude, you can't help but love him as a character. His shenanigans and lack of forethought throw the trio into a situation that they might not make it out of unscathed.

Percy, his best friend, is much more responsible and adds a perspective to the history that we might not think of otherwise. Although his father is a titled man, he fathered Percy with a woman of colour which gives readers the perspective of a man of mixed-race rather than the white-privilege that we see from Monty.  Felicity is well-educated because she is stubborn and refuses to bow to the whims of society. She wants to study medicine, so she finds any book she can on the subject and devours it. Felicity's character also allows readers to see the position of a woman in those times, to realize how far we have come in the treatment of woman, or just anyone who is not a Caucasian male, their equality, and how far we still have to go on all accounts.

I have noticed that some people find the story to be slow, which is not quite how I would describe it. The first few chapters might be tough to get into as it is not immediately the energy of a swashbuckling pirate adventure or high stakes battle in space, but it does find its stride. The journey the reader is taken on is highly enjoyable and certainly worth the slower early build up. Plus the flirting is precious and I want to believe that it is a historically accurate portrayal of a person from that time period.

Mackenzie Lee does a wonderful job of taking us on a Grand Tour of Europe, despite the fact that most of us probably are not familiar with the continent in the 1700's. She adds authentic little items into the story like cities, events or jobs that make the story feel real. It is clear that she did a lot of research and it makes her book shine.

I highly recommend this to young adult/teen readers even if they don't feel that they are historical fiction readers. This story is fun and will give you all of the feels, although you may want to hit Monty upside the head a few times. This cute story will leave you wanting more of the trio and wondering if you are a historical fiction fan after all.",1515974400,4

In Homo Deus, Harari looks ahead and speculates what changes and advancements in biology, technology, medicine, economics, etc, will bring to Human development in the not-so-distant future.

Harari isn't prophesying or stating exactly how some of the monumental changes will ultimately play out. Instead, he writes of possibilities and historical indicators, then goes from there. This really is an interesting (and often frightening) time to be alive. And so many scientific fields are advancing at full speed, makes my head spin. Will Sapiens use new knowledge to cheat death and become a-mortal? What happens when large sectors of the world economy are replaced by computers and algorithms that perform better than humans? What would a human lifespan of 150 years or more do to society?

  Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, a mother, their teenage son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldnt, her world begins to crumbleand its shocking secrets are laid bare.

We learn that she hasn't left her house in ten months; that she takes a lot of medication and drinks too much; that she watches a lot of black and white movies like Vertigo and Rear Window; and that she meets other agoraphobic people in forums online. Plus, Anna watches the neighbors through her windows.

As we walk through the rooms of Annas house along with her, she narrates her passage for us; we can visualize the beauty of it all, with lots of space and lovely rooms. But it is also a very lonely place for someone who is virtually locked within those walls. Mostly what we notice about her home is the absence of the people she lovesand no explanation for their absence.

Slowly her story unfolds, and it will be a long while before we start to learn what happened to her. Flashbacks reveal bits and pieces as we rapidly turn the pages.

Then, as the story continues, we watch through her window with her, and what she sees will change everything for her. Now many people are harassing her; the cops do not believe her; and she is losing her grip more and more.

Even as I knew that she could be every bit as delusional as everyone thinks, another part of me did not really believe that. There were numerous creepy and suspicious characters, and since nothing is quite as it seems, anything is possible. It will be a long while before Anna puts the pieces together. How will she finally discover the truth? What will happen to her in the end? I felt breathless and thoroughly engaged as the intense moments near the end brought the story to a riveting and unexpected conclusion. 5 stars.",1515974400,5
5769,621,727,"As this is the second book in a series, there may be spoilers in this review for the first book. Please be aware and read the first book (or my first review) before delving into this. I found One Dark Throne to be a little slow to start, but that may have just been because I didn't reread Three Dark Crowns before jumping back into the world. It would have been better to be reacquainted with the world and all of the minor characters (that can get confusing) before I started the second book. Once I was engrossed in the world again, I was completely drawn into the story and enjoyed myself.

The three sisters continue their fight for the crown and there is more plotting in this book. Mirabella is no longer the chosen queen after her sisters' strong showings in the first book. Katharine is willing to do whatever it takes to win her crown. Arsinoe doesn't want to kill, even to save her own life. Mirabella is hurt and betrayed and realizes that she might not be willing to cross the line to be queen. The three queens develop and grow over the course of the novel.

While there is character growth in this novel, I do wish there was more development. It was nice to see glimpses into the relationship between Natalia and Katharine, as it is deeper than either generally let on. But Nicholas, Pietyr and Genieve felt more like flat characters than ones I could feel were well fleshed out. This problem extends to other characters both in Arsinoe's home and Mirabella's. There are so many minor characters that most of them don't have the ""screen time"" to become fully developed characters that contribute to the story. (And some a very similar names to others, which can be very confusing if each person doesn't feel like a unique creation.)

Personally, I really like Arsinoe and Mirabella (sorry Katharine supporters) so I have a tough time determining how I would like the series to play out. That being said, the series continues to surprise and confuse me. It is not formulaic and I really enjoy the plot. The world building and magic system are fascinating, which is what keeps me wanting more from the series.

I would definitely recommend this book (after you've read or reread the first, of course) and cannot wait to see how this story continues in future books.",1515974400,4

5773,775,411,"The book was originally written in Hebrew and it was translated later on. That should imply some caution about what the real thinking of the author might be since Hebrew is a first articulation root language and English is a third articulation analytical frond language. The two languages are not compatible in many ways and translating one into the other is necessarily problematic.

This being said we can now deal with the book the way it appears in English.

The first remark is fundamental. Before even making this remark it is important to understand that phrase like most  agree today that  is a purely ideological and rhetorical means and it has absolutely no scientific value. It is not because the majority of mathematicians think this or that on a crucial and debated question that their opinion is true. All scientific progress always came from the ideas that challenged what most people in the concerned scientific field thought at the time. Copernic and Galileo Galilei would have had to invent nothing about the shape of the earth if the majority of people had thought it was round at the time. This discovery was a discovery because most people thought the earth was flat at the time. The majority was wrong. And such a majority rule is dangerous by principle, particularly in some political arenas.

My first remark is that the book starts the history of humanity at 70,000 years BCE. At this time all the migrations out of Africa have taken place and were practically finished. That enables the author NOT TO CONSIDER the at least 230,000 years of Homo Sapienss emergence before this date 70,000 BCE, and this emergence took place in Africa and ONLY Africa. This is from my point of view a grave and sinister shortcoming that is practically racist, de facto segregative against Africans. The author can then forget to tell us we are all originally black and in the book this black exclusion is systematic. Later on, when he speaks of the agricultural revolution, he rightly connects this agriculture with cereals, rice, wheat, corn, and some other like rye, oats, etc. And here again, since this agriculture that emerged in Africa too is not based on cereals (except in Egypt which is not officially black) but on cassava which is a root, the African continent is entirely ignored. This then becomes a bias, a choice, a desire, an intention: ignore Africa. But on the other hand, he writes for a good old western Jewish or Christian audience, marginally Muslim, and such emblematic symbols of these references are used, even as chapter titles, like Adam and Eve. There are quite a few moments on the book when you hesitate between a reference to some religious fundamental reference and some often indirect assertion of non-adherence to such religious faith and allegiance. These elements are in no way scientific and are in no way analyzed from any scientific point of view, and thus they become rattles or drums to attract the attention of the poor, ignorant, uneducated and nave popular reader.

The second remark is about the three revolutions he states as the three stages of human history. These three revolutions are the cognitive revolution, the agricultural revolution, and the scientific revolution. He will refer later on to the industrial revolution but for him, it seems to be the result of the scientific revolution. He disdains technology as NOT being scientific, and he forgets that all science is by definition and first of all experimental and thus technological. But I want to make a general remark here that concerns absolutely all uses of the word revolution. It has become popular since the American and the French Revolutions, maybe even the Glorious Revolution in Great Britain some time earlier. Note this last one was achieved by one decision of the British parliament and with no violence, except of course the banning of Catholics and Jews from all official positions and at times with some cleansing local missions against this or that Jew or Catholic up to the 19th century, not to mention the supporters of the deposed king known as Jacobites. All revolutions take time and if the Soviet Revolution is reduced to ten days, it is a pure lie. The Soviet Revolution was only stabilized after four or five years of war. The French Revolution was never stabilized except by becoming an empire under the dictatorial authority of the war monger that Napoleon became. But the use of revolution for things like the emergence of agriculture and herding, of human cognition and of science is the most irrelevant use of the term. These three moments in the emergence of modern humanity took tens of thousands of years, each one of them, to actually emerge and stabilize. Let me look at these three moments considered by the author.

The cognitive revolution is by far the best case. The author never says that cognition needs a tool to exist, and that tool is language. So he does not ask the question of the origin of language and its emergence. He thus let the good old Christian, Jewish and Muslim idea that man received language fully developed from some godlike authority be the only reference behind. And this is non-scientific and vain. Language existed before Homo Sapiens and when Homo Sapiens emerged he inherited this language. What we can say is that the language of Homo Ergaster, to use one name of the Hominin who is the ancestor of Homo Sapiens (and also of Neanderthals and Denisovans), was more advanced than the language of the monkeys and apes he was descending from. We have studies of monkey language and it is clear it only contains three or four vocalic sounds and five or six consonantal sounds. These sounds are organized in syllabic calls of the Consonant-Vowel-Consonant form most of the time and their number is seven or so. By Human means, these vowels and these consonants could have produced about 125 one-syllable words. These monkeys did not have the rotation of vowels and consonants, the key to the first articulation of human articulated language. Did Homo Ergaster have some limited control of this rotation or not? It is an open question. Did Neanderthals and Denisovans have some limited control of this rotation? It is an open question.

But the most important element is that Homo Sapiens when he left the forest to enter the savanna was already bipedal like many Hominins before him. But he had to become a bipedal, fast, long-distance runner to be able to hunt and escape encounters like lions in a savanna that had very few trees, and Homo Sapiens was not a tree climber. This activity could develop because natural selection selected some mutations that made Homo Sapiens the runner he became: a very low larynx (the pump of long distance breathing); a very strong diaphragm (the piston of this breathing pump); a great innervation of the subglottal respiratory and articulatory zone indispensable for long distance running; and of course a developed Broca zone that coordinates all these I have mentioned, plus organs like the heart and every active part of the body at work in this long distance running. All these elements are fundamental to running but they open a new field of activity: speaking, which is by the way indispensable for hunting coordination in the savanna and over long distances between the hunters. Calls can do that but Homo Sapiens could produce an easy 12 vowels and 25 consonants (especially since the teeth of Homo Sapiens could produce dentals and other consonants that monkeys could not produce because of their teeth). And this started 300,000 years BCE, 230,000 years before the date of Hararis cognitive revolution.

This language is essential because of the human brain. The human brain like all brains of all animals that have brains can deal with nerve impulses of some type or other coming from the various senses. Then it can process these nerve impulses and turn them into something the brain can process and this processing produces patterns the brain captures in what it processes. The brain then classifies these patterns in brain-code which is nothing but machine-code. Homo Sapiens and quite a few more hominins, and hominids before, can go a little bit further and attach a vocal production to these brain-coded patterns. You can see at once the rotation of vowels and consonants is essential to thus produce what is nothing but calls among monkeys, lower members of hominids, and it can become something richly developed as soon as the first articulation is captured. And that opens the road for Homo Sapiens and the top Hominins to a process that is only human. The brain-code patterns are names, which means the brain has to develop two things at the same time and those two things are virtual in the brain. It is the mind and language. The two develop simultaneously in a coordinated way. The development of one causes the development of the other and nourishes itself from this development, and vice versa. This development opens the door to experimentation, speculation, and conceptualization. There is no cognition if there is no language to express and transmit, hence to communicate the mental activity that starts from brain-code patterns that are experimented, speculated upon and conceptualized.

It is even more complicated because human articulated language has three articulations that have to be developed in a certain sequence dictated by the phylogeny of language. The very same phylogeny of language with the very same 10 vowels and 20 consonants, on the basis of the rotation of these sounds, will be able to develop on the model of the communicational situation a newborn is confronted too from the very first minute till he or she dies, a full morphology and a full syntax. Note the second articulation is morphological and the third articulation is syntactic. If the language spoken by the people at a certain moment in this phylogenetic development does not contain a morphology or a syntax per se, the communicational situation will provide whats missing in discourse. When this is said it is obvious it must take some time, and cognition develops at the same time because cognition takes place in the mind and needs language which is developed and develops in the mind. Lets say that Homo Sapiens had reached the third articulation of this phylogeny around 70,000-50,000 BCE, but the third migration out of Africa was already engaged and practically finished. What about the first two migrations that took place for the first one around 180,000 BCE (or slightly earlier) and attested in Crete in 160,000 BCE, and for the second one around 100,000 BCE or so? What was the phylogenic development of their language or languages at the time, where did the three migrations go and what languages did they produce, that are still alive today after their subsequent evolution?

We cannot reproach a historian with not being a linguist or a phylogenist, though he could have thought that history is the human activity that tries to follow and describe the phylogeny of human life, of any and all human-created elements of human life. Hararis history is IN NO WAY phylogenic. The main question of phylogenic cognition is: Where did the element I am studying come from? That implies another question: What is the inner development of any phenomenon I am studying? And there I must say Harari is deficient.

I would like now to consider an element Harari totally overlooks. He does not even use the word: division of labor. Strangely enough, Harari does not transfer what he says page 300-301 concerning the Queen of England Eleanor, in fact, the wife of the King of England Edward I, who gave birth to sixteen children between 1255 and 1284, thus over 29 years. That means one pregnancy every 21-22 months. Only the last child was a boy. All others were girls and out of the sixteen pregnancies only 6 got to the procreational age of 12 and then to adulthood. Ten of these children either did not survive birth or only a few weeks or months, or died in infancy and childhood. That represents 37.5% of survival to adulthood.  The only objective of this mother was to produce a male heir to the English crown. Harari should transfer this to Homo Sapiens emerging 300,000 years BCE. Life expectancy was about 29 and it will remain around 29 till the eighteenth century and even in some European countries the 19th century. Agriculture before Christ when it was developed is accused by some to have reduced for a while this life expectancy to 19. The point is that this accusation is not clear because does it concern only those working in the fields or does it concern the whole society. If it were true, the human species should have disappeared. Let me explain.

Before agriculture and before the Ice Age (peak 19,000 BCE) life expectancy was 29. Women were fertile from 13 to 29. That means only 16 years and we should take into account those who died during the pregnancy, while delivering and from various accidents or diseases. All women did not reach the age of 29. Difficult to know the proportion of those who did not. If we transfer the 21 to 22 months between each pregnancy and birth that means women in those days could carry about seven pregnancies. If we apply the proportion of survival we have seen, that means that only 2.75 children will reach maturity. It is quite obvious that this is not feasible for the survival and expansion of the species for a few reasons: the case taken before is the case of a queen living in perfect comfort at the time and with all medical help if necessary, and available, which is more than 300,000 years BCE. That means she had it easier than a women 300,000 years BCE. I would say the mother then, women in general had to shorten the distance between two pregnancies to 18 months to reach beyond three surviving child reaching maturity (13 years of age). Then a mother can have 10 or 11 pregnancies. If we reduce the survival rate to 33% then that makes 3.5 surviving children brought to maturity. That sounds more realistic, and yet some may say that it means a woman has to be impregnated within the first six to nine months following her delivery. Clearly women are either pregnant or carrying an un-autonomous child on her back and taking care of at least two more who are still dependent. The mistake here would be to treat each woman separately. In fact, if we treat women as a collective they have in their own hands the survival and expansion of the species but then they have to abide by a strict division of labor. Women as soon as they are of age for procreation (13 years of age) have to dedicate their life and activity to bearing, carrying and taking care of children collectively. This is an essential division of labor imposed by the long dependence of children on outside care. And then if we follow the recent research on cave paintings in Indonesia and in Europe that show many hand prints, these prints are essentially from women with a few young, very young teenagers (some male). That is to say women had another dimension: they were the artists, the priestesses, the go-between for humans and spirits, they were responsible for the spiritual life of the community. Woman were not dominant in any way as some want it with matriarchy. Their role was just as essential as the role of men, who were the main hunters and gatherers and who provided the community with the food and energy needed to survive and to expand. In this perspective it is a myth to believe that human communities before the Ice Age were dominated by women, just as much as it would be a mistake to consider the same communities were dominated by men. We are speaking here of division of labor within a community that has to be contemplated as cooperative. The emergence of agriculture after the Ice Age will change this division of labor.

To refer to Sally McBrearty, an archeologist who works on Southern Africa, the very concept of agricultural revolution is absurd because it took several thousand years (probably 10,000 more or less) to emerge all over the world, including in Africa, without any communication between the various and continents, based in each area on one local crop, mostly grains (except in Africa) and many other vegetables like potatoes, yakons, ocas, beans, squashes of all sorts, and many others. Harari deals with it as if it were a magical event and does not understand that some of these plants needed probably a lot of experimentation, speculation, and conceptualization before becoming edible for human beings. Cassava is poisonous and has to be cooked, processed in a very complex way to be purified. Corn is derived from self-sowing wild varieties but the domesticated variety cannot sow itself and needs the hands of human beings. The passage from the wild species to the domesticated species is still not clear. It is also a common knowledge that irrigation in the simple form of watering was invented too and had to be developed. The oldest irrigation systems known to men today are one in China, the oldest, another in Babylon in the Middle East, the second oldest. These two can be compared as to their complexity and technology and yet it is quite difficult to state a connection and if connection there were it would be from China to the Middle East, which would not surprise many people but is contradictory with Hararis ideas who centers his vision of human history entirely on what is today the west. China, just like Africa is rejected out of Hararis pale and territory. Harari forgets along this line the simple fact that before the Ice Age and for something like 180,000 years Homo Sapiens was emerging in Africa, and necessarily, just like the way he devised various hunting techniques after devising various stone cutting and polishing techniques he also devised some techniques to take care of the natural garden that nature was to him: clean up around the plants that interested him, maybe even water some of them, harvest them with care for them to produce again the following year, etc. I would be surprised if some of them did not experiment sowing for example, but it was probably not needed yet and it may have remained an experiment. Thats one thing Harari forgets: humanity develops a technique and a technology, not to mention a science, when humanity is ready to do it and to need it. The Roman invented the watermill next to Marseilles one century BCE and they never used it because slaves were by far good enough to grind cereals.

After the Ice Age, the surviving Homo Sapiens  and then no other Hominin species was still alive  agriculture developed slowly and required a new division of labor to cultivate the fields and to build the various constructions needed to live in, to store crops in and to practice various spiritual or collective activities in. As for the cultivation of the land, some had to be the controllers of the land and the work on it. Some had to be the controllers of the working teams on this land and of the herding teams further out. Some had to be the controllers of the harvests and their distribution. Some finally had to be the controllers of the storing and commercial use of the surplus after distribution. All that could be done on a cooperative basis and the controllers could also be rotating field workers on all positions. Some communities did work like that, particularly in Africa from what I know. It seems that most communities all around the world evolved towards a hierarchical society with an elite and the mass of the working population. The elite could be itself divided into several groups: the landowners, the human resources managers, the harvest collectors and other accountants (note writing seems to be a must at this stage and some clay tablets have been found with such data as far as Romania and dated as far as 6,000 BCE. Before this durable medium, Homo Sapiens probably used degradable media that have disappeared. Once again cuneiform writing goes a long may before the official date of 3,500-3,000 BCE.

We can note this elite probably contained a group of people who were controlling spiritual and/or religious activities. The new point at this moment is that this elite in all its various elements seems to be composed of men, or at least mostly men. The mass of people cultivate the soil, harvest the crops, process them, build the various needed constructions, eventually the towns, the roads, and the levees of the irrigation system and canals. In Sumerian, the same word or root is used for water, irrigation canals, sperm, and father. The change is complete. And Harari would have been inspired if then he would have studied the position and role women played and the degree of freedom/dependence the members of the mass of workers had. Then he could also have explored the tools, techniques and technologies these societies had (among others the wheel, the plow, the use of metal for field work, etc. He would certainly have been able to understand that such techniques, or such technologies are the result of a lot of experimentation, speculation and conceptualization, and that this elaboration is both technological and scientific.

But Hararis worst case of western Europe-centered sectarianism concerns what he calls the scientific revolution that he dates with Bacon and his scientific works in the 16th century. Geometry in Greece is ignored though it was invented to manage the boundaries and surfaces of fields. The tremendous knowledge in cosmology, architecture, and physics necessary for the construction of all monumental pyramids, temples, cities, ports and harbors, etc. from Gobekli Tepe (he dates it as being from around 9,500 BCE) to the city of Rome, is all neglected, bypassed.. If all that knowledge is not scientific, then technology is reduced to tinkering about, which it is not. But even worse, he totally ignores the enormity of Asia, both China and India, and their phenomenal advances in various sciences. The existence of ZERO (the Mayas had an equivalent in their counting systems long before it was introduced in Europe) is one of these scientific items along with of course cosmology, navigation with ships about five to ten times as big as Christopher Columbuss ship that looks like a bark or a boat next to the Chinese vessels. And what about the phenomenal architecture, enamels, advanced herding and agriculture, irrigation and transportation dating vastly to a time before anything comparable was introduced in the west. But even in the West, he does not know the horse collar was invented by the Benedictines in the 10th century. He does not know the Benedictines were known as the engineers of the Middles Ages and they recuperated the Roman invention of the watermill and developed it with the invention of the lantern-gear to transform the vertical rotating movement of the wheel into the horizontal rotating movement of the grindstone. He does not know these Benedictines arrived in Ireland in the 6th century and introduced technologies and knowledge they had preserved by salvaging the Roman libraries. He apparently does not know anything about Arabic medicine that was absolutely dominant in Europe, the Middle East and beyond up to the 12th century when Islam went through a closing up movement. China will go through a similar movement after the death of Admiral Zheng He in the middle of the 15th century. And what about Euclid and Archimedes in Greece, Ptolemy and many others in Alexandria and its library?

He might be right on one superficial point but totally wrong on how it happened. The Black Death decimated Europe (between 50% and 75% of its population was concerned or plainly killed). The need to have a new university system to train thousands and thousands of people was required to recover from the plague, rebuild the countries, their administration and services. This motivated Gutenberg and his associate to develop or maybe import from China, where it had existed for quite a while, the printing press in 1450. It is this Black Death catastrophe, the end of the 100-year war, and the printing press that provided the momentum needed to open up universities, start training people with books. That is called the Quattrocento, the Renaissance with tremendous technological inventions and progress. That means what Harari calls the scientific revolution is, in fact, the result of more than two millennia of evolution in what is going to be the west, probably the result of three millennia of evolution in the East, and a lot of exchanges from one world to the other, Spain being a crossroads till the Catholic Church reconquered it and expelled everything that was not European, Catholic and very humble towards the new crown. Let say the world had the chance of being able in a way or another to save the treasures of old technological and scientific knowledge kept and developed in Spain before the Reconquista. Otherwise, that knowledge which was not printed but copied in very few manuscripts would have been lost for quite a while. Descartes developed algebra but the very name of this science shows its Arabic origin, in fact, or rather Arabic transit or passage since this ZERO comes from a lot farther than the Arab world, and we could even say a lot farther than the Muslim world.

But where is he right? In the simple fact that Gutenbergs printing technology, known for a long time as a mystery in England, gave learning and science the possibility to develop the position of the scientist. Before this character was a sorcerer, a metaphysical speculator or a heretic alchemist, most of them chased by the Catholic Church and its Inquisition, forced to abjure his discovery like Galileo Galilei or plainly tortured to purify them of the devil through their suffering and screaming and then burnt to the stake. It is quite obvious that the revolution if it is a revolution and not a several-century-long evolution, is not scientific but a lot wider: it is the conquest, in the west, of basic freedoms. The first document in that fields is signed by Henry I in England in 1100 promising his people (meaning free men paying taxes of course) he will respect their freedoms and liberties. And this declaration comes from a very distant past that probably goes back to the Greeks, though Aristotle considered that slaves had a slavish nature (page 150). Harari would have been well inspired if he had studied the emergence, hence the phylogeny, of basic human rights in the history of humanity after the Ice Age instead of pretending he was presenting a history of humanity as a whole, since he missed some if not most essential principles, steps, evolutions in the last seventeen or eighteen millennia. Humanity and its evolution do not have a teleology but they sure have a phylogeny. We might be able to construct a teleological vision of the future from this phylogeny but it would be absolutely vain to pretend the prediction has any historical and scientific value. In the very last chapters of the book Harari is totally disappointing because he misses the analysis necessary to understand not a supposed revolution in the field of technology or science, called the Singularity or whatever other concept, but to capture some dynamic that will produce the future in a general confrontation of contradictions and we could hope that maybe this will not lead to a conflagration.

I understand these people who told me they were disappointed by the end, just as much as I understand those who love the book because it is simple. True enough. It is simple and instead of experimenting, speculating and conceptualizing the book too often stops at the level of the simple patterns the brain captured, and translates the brain code in which they are frozen and stored into some excessively too long common and simple language. It is true if he had reduced the book to the two-hundred-page maximum it should have been, then the shortcomings would have been very clear for lack of wrapping paper and commercial bows and labels. Get into that book only if you are able to speed read.

5774,16,218,"3.5 I Know My Name is the debut novel of C.J. Cooke. And I have a copy to giveaway to one lucky reader!

The book opens in 2015. A woman is washed up on an isolated Greek island. She has no idea who she is or what she was doing when her boat wrecked on the island's rocky shore. And in England a man is frantic - his wife has gone missing, leaving her two small children behind.

The reader is privy to more than either lead character. We know what is happening in the England investigation. And what is happening on Kommeno Island. The island is not completely deserted, as we discover that there are four other people on the island. Their behavior is odd and they seem determined to keep our unnamed woman with them. ""The only way to get off this island is to remember.""

I always enjoy a back and forth narrative - it's guaranteed to keep me reading later than I had planned. Cooke inserts a third narrative about a quarter of the way into the book. It is set in 1983 - and explains much. With that information, I had a strong inkling as to how the two 2015 narratives would connect. I was partially right, but Cooke throws in a twist at the end.

I found myself drawn more to the London search that the time on the island. Perhaps because there were numerous characters and more happening. I found the island scenes and dialogue very off kilter with it's decidedly strange inhabitants. Things did make more sense in the run up to the final answer. That ending goes on a bit longer than I would have preferred. Now, being deliberately oblique - Cooke uses those last chapters to 'educate' the reader. While I appreciate this, it was more than I wanted as the pieces had been put together. Warning to gentle readers - there are some disturbing elements to this tale.

I Know My Name is a good debut.",1515974400,4
5775,263,248,"Theres a famous quote that has been attributed to various individuals, including both Mark Twain and Blaise Pascal. The wording varies, but the gist is: Sorry for writing you a long letter, I didn't have time to write a short one.  While its a witty comment, the humorous subversion of expectations doesnt mean theres not an underlying truth. It takes work and / or brilliance to convey an idea persuasively with few words.  A Christmas Carol is an outstanding example of a tight story that powerfully conveys its theme.

Ebenezer Scrooge is a cranky banker who wants nothing to do Christmas. He won't give his employee, Bob Cratchit, time off so that Cratchit can spend the holiday with his familyincluding his ailing son Tiny Tim. He chases off charities. He won't even accept an invitation to attend the Christmas party thrown by his nephew, Fred. Then one night, hes visited by the ghost of his recently deceased business partnerJacob Marley.  Marley, who was as cheap and crotchety as Scrooge, is burdened with horrifying chains, and the ghost warns Scrooge that if the old man doesnt change his ways, hetoowill end up wandering through eternity in a similar set of chains. Before disappearing, Marley tells Scrooge to expect visits from three more ghosts.

The three subsequent visits with the famous ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future don't require much discussion. First of all, the names of the ghosts (e.g. Ghost of Christmas Past) are self-explanatory. Secondly, this story is iconic in pop culture and its been remade in every medium in every way imaginable from modern adaptations (e.g. Scrooged) to Simpsons episodes.  At any rate, the first ghost shows Scrooge that there was a time when he wasn't such a curmudgeon while reminding him that he once had an employer, the beloved Mr. Fezziwig, who was a much better to Scrooge than Scrooge is to Bob Cratchit.  The second ghost takes him to see the Cratchits and their meager but blissful Christmas festivities and then to his Nephews party as well.  The final apparition, The Ghost of Christmas Future, takes Scrooge to the end of his own line.  In the wake of the four ghost visits, Scrooge makes some changes to avoid the fate hes been shown.

The Puffin Classics version that I read has an introduction by Anthony Horowitz and some artwork. That said, I don't think it matters much what version one reads. Its about the story.

A young adult novel about life and death and moving on doesn't sound all that original at first, but Green's treatment of adolescents is different. He makes his characters complex and intelligent and impulsive as every teenager truly is. He does not treat his characters as they might treat themselves, over-important or that which should be pitied. Nor does he treat them as so many adults might, with disdain for their rashness and lack of experience. The author makes his story accessible and realistic to teens and adults alike because there seems to be truth in the conflicting emotions his characters go through.

Mildly pornographic. MILDLY. Just tasteful enough for adolescents learning that sex is confusing and funny and kinda great but really just mostly confusing at first.

I'm glad the answers aren't given in this book. It's about learning how to move on when there aren't definite answers, when there is doubt.

Of course, the world would be chaotic if the dreams only changed the present, but they also retroactively change the past to be consistent with the new present. Orr is the only one who remembers both the new and old timelines, but hes not happy with these god-like powers--especially given the chaotic and unpredictable possibilities that arise from the subconscious mind.  Not unexpectedly, Orr is reluctant to tell anyone this because they will think hes mad.

Orr gets assigned to voluntary therapy with a psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders.  Orr tells Dr. William Haber about his unique condition, but, once the doctor recognizes Orr is telling the truth, Haber draws the opposite conclusion from Orr. Haber thinks that Orr should be using his power to make the world a better place, rather than being scared of it and trying to avoid it. Haber presents the classic example of good intentions gone awry. While the doctor does use the hypnotically-induced sessions to improve his own career situation, the worst outcomes result from the doctors attempts to help Orr (without Orrs approval or prior knowledge) to improve the world. The law of unintended consequences is ever-present, and the dreams guided by Haber often result in out of the frying pan and into the fire situations.

This is an interesting premise in a highly readable book.  The contrast between Orr and Haber reflects a broader societal tension between those who think they can engineer a utopian future and those who think that ones attempts will always blow up in ways that one cant anticipate.  It should be noted that the title comes from The Book of Chuang Tzu and the virtue of wu-wei or actionless action in contrast to the corresponding vice of trying to manhandle the world into a desired state is central to the story.

I enjoyed this book. Its a short novel with a clear theme that is thought-provoking. Id recommend the book for fiction readers, and highly recommend it for readers of sci-fi and speculative fiction.",1515974400,5

5785,378,155,"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those novels (and movies) that is referenced everywhere in pop culture. But of course, because its French lit, Id been putting it off. My husband ranks it up there as one of his top favorite movies, but aside from the brief sword fight and Can we come up? scene in V for Vendetta, I really had no reference pointI thought it was all about dueling.  Of course I knew there was some sort of prison revenge plot, but thats about it.

When I read The Black Count, though, and found out why Alexandre Dumas wrote CoMCI knew I had to move it up the list. This book was so much more than I expected it to be. At first, I was mostly just looking for comparisons to General Dumas life, but the longer the story went on (and this story is LONG), the more I got wrapped up in it.

I read The Three Musketeers a few years ago, and hated every moment of it. I found the characterization ridiculous and irregularly detailed, and I didn't understand why we couldn't just get to the point and action. However, now that I know that Dumas was paid BY THE LINEall that makes so much sense! Heck, I would write the thing to death too! Also, I learned in The Black Count that one of the most important things in the world to Dumas was never to forget a person, the way he felt his father was forgotten. That is why every person he writes has a backstory, and every backstory has a place in the plot.

This is the very crux of Edmond Dantes vengeance. Everyone has forgotten himto the point that he can parade around in society as a massively rich countand no one recognizes the man they sent to prison. Because of that, he is able to destroy their lives from the inside out. But in the end, is that vengeance as sweet as he hoped it would be?

Im glad I gave Alexandre Dumas another chance. Theres so much depth to his writing that I didn't see before. You cant rush Dumas, thats for certain, and I think thats what I had tried to do with The Three MusketeersI had too many expectations of what it was supposed to be. The Count of Monte Cristo is a wholly brilliant story, and I look forward to reading it over and over.",1515974400,5
5786,532,1754,"Dr. No by Ian Fleming is the sixth novel in a series featuring James Bond, 007 from Her Majestys Secret Service.

Commander John Strangways, head of MI6 in Kingston, Jamaica has mysteriously disappeared and M sends James Bond to investigate. Bond knows that Strangways has been investigating a Chinese-German living on Crab Key island named Dr. Julius No.

Bonds old friend, Quarrel, helps get on Crab Island to see if there is connection between Dr. No and the disappearance of Commander Strangways. On the island the pair meets Honeychile Rider who makes her living collecting valuable shells. Soon after Bond and Honey get captures by Dr. Nos dragon and discover that there is more to the island than it seems.

Dr. No by Ian Fleming is probably the most over the top novel in an over the top series I have read so far. The novel is fun but sadism and racism clearly carry the narrative. In the previous novels the author at least attempted to sound somewhat open minded, no need to worry here about it.

The previous novel, From Russia with Love, ended with Bond winning the fight but with his life in peril. Unfortunately, this novel did not continue from the very dramatic and excellent ending. How Bond got well after being poisoned and passing out is a mystery, not to mention getting well.

Mr. Flemings attempt at write the character of Quarrel in authentic Jamaican voice backfired. The way the author has the character speak says more about his prejudices then help the reader imagine the character and scene. In his defense, it is very tricky writing even today with much more resources that Mr. Fleming could have even dream of and the Quarrel himself is one of the best friends Bond can have.

The evil Dr. No is creepy and foolish, lording over his vast empire of bird shit and protecting it to extreme degrees since its so lucrative.  Honey Rider, this installments femme fatale, was a bright spot. Starting out as an emotional woman, she really came to her own in the end of the novel with spirit and intelligence which fools Dr. No and Bond.

This book is fun and silly and it seems that Mr. Fleming had a good time cutting down a character he almost seemed bored of writing.  That being said, the James Bond of print is much more interesting and deep than the James Bond of the big screen.",1515974400,3
5787,519,649,"London, at the tail-end of the nineteenth century, is the largest city on Earth, the centre of the world's greatest empire; indeed, the centre of the world. As its population grows, its tentacles are spreading out to incorporate the various towns and villages around it into suburbs for the middle classes. A vast swarm of humanity, scurrying busily to and fro, like ants around an ant-heap. A tempting eat-all-you-want buffet for hungry aliens...

The story of The War of the Worlds is so well known that it requires very little in the way of blurb. Martians invade and use their vastly superior technology to destroy everything and everyone in their path. The only question is  will they ultimately win, or will they be defeated? On the remote chance that anyone doesn't know the answer, I won't say.

The book is far more interesting for what it says about Wells' world than for the story itself. The unnamed narrator is on the spot when the first Martian spacecraft lands. He sees the creatures emerge and watches as they fiddle about with equipment. Then he's as surprised and shocked as everyone else when it turns out they're not here with peaceful intentions and have no desire to communicate with humans. Instead, they set off on a course of massive destruction. The British Army  the greatest army in the world, the army that has defeated and massacred untold thousands of people in its imperial triumphs around the world  is crushed, its best weapons as ineffective against the Martians' as a native spear against a machine gun. As the narrator wanders the countryside trying to find his wife from whom he's become separated, he describes the horror of this invasion  death and destruction only the beginning of the Martians' terrible plan for the inhabitants of earth...

Britain's psychological relationship with its empire never ceases to fascinate me. When Wells was writing this, the Empire was at its height, seemingly invincible. But already there were signs of cracks appearing  uprisings, demands for self-rule. Plus there was the question of its moral justification, beginning to be debated. Were we bringing civilisation to the barbarian, or exploiting him? Could we even be sure he was a barbarian? Was victory in war still glorious when one side had weapons the other side had never even dreamt of?

Wells turns the whole question on its head by doing the unthinkable  he makes London the centre of the invasion rather than the home of the invaders. He brings onto our village greens, our city streets, our familiar landmarks, the kind of destruction Britain itself had been perpetrating around the world. Invasion! Perhaps Britain's biggest fear and biggest boast. This tiny island nation with its massive navy, supreme in its confidence that it was able to defend itself against all comers. No invader had set foot on British soil in almost a thousand years. Our naval supremacy was our protection and our pride. But the Martians don't come across the sea... they come from above. Was it coincidence that Wells was writing at the time that man was about to successfully take to the skies, creating a new threat that would lead eventually to the massive destruction rained down on us in the middle of the twentieth century?

To us, the idea of invasion from space is almost laughable. We know there's no life on Mars, or if there is it's not of the kind that builds spacecraft; and distance alone makes the likelihood of invasion from other solar systems seem negligible. But to the late Victorians, the idea of life on Mars was real. Schiaparelli had seen the 'canals' and some scientists believed they were a sign of a technologically advanced species, trying to harness what little water remained on a dying planet. What more likely than that a species who could do that could build spacecraft? And that, seeing the lush blue and green of planet Earth, they would want to colonise it, exploit it, as we exploited other nations?

The whole idea of evolution, Darwinism, was also at the forefront of the late Victorian consciousness. Suddenly it isn't quite so clear that humanity is the ultimate species, born to dominate all others. Maybe, just maybe, there are other species out there that have evolved further, or faster. And who's to say they'll necessarily be peaceful? Evolution is a recurring theme in Wells' books  he'd already addressed it extensively in both The Island of Doctor Moreau and The Time Machine. In this one, he makes the double suggestion that there may be more evolved species out there in space, and also that ultimately man may not be the most resilient form of life here on earth. Scary stuff for a society that had been so sure of its mastery of all it surveyed!

As a story, I might only rate this one as 3 or 4 stars. It tends to be more description than action and the ending is somewhat anti-climactic for modern tastes. But for what it says about the British psyche of its time it fully deserves its place as a classic and the maximum 5. And I haven't even talked about how influential it's been on science fiction in books and films over the last century.

I read the new Oxford World's Classics edition which includes an interesting and informative foreword and notes by Darryl Jones, who is the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences at Trinity College Dublin. He goes into much more depth on the themes I've mentioned and more, and puts the book into its historical and literary context. I highly recommend these OWC editions  I find the forewords, without being overly long, pack in a lot of information and add a huge amount to my appreciation of the books.

5789,621,1041,"Magnus Chase: Ship of the Dead is the final book in the series that blends Norse mythology with the modern world. Rick Riordan writes in his typical humourous fashion and makes learning fun (even if its not always entirely accurate.) As this is the third and final book in the series, there isn't too much to say that wouldnt spoil the first two books if you have not read them so I would recommend doing so before reading this review. You can also read my review of the first book as it is spoiler-free.

Our heroes continue their journey to postpone Ragnarok and defeat Loki. Magnus is joined by Samirah the Valkyrie, Hearthstone the Elf, Blitzen the Dwarf and his fellow Einherjar Alex, Mallory, TJ and Halfborn. They must battle giants, outwit guardians, and save the world from utter destruction. Just your average Tuesday.

I really enjoyed how diversity was represented in this series as we have main characters with different sexualities or orientations, religions, ethnicities, and disabilities. Since I am not most of the ones that were represented in the book, I can't speak to how accurate the portrayal was but I am glad that they were included. As a casual reader, the representation felt informative and not condescending or demeaning.

Rick continues his world building by sending our heroes off on adventures in the nine realms while simultaneously teaching us a bit about Norse mythology. His books are a very approachable way to tackle the topic and perhaps foster a sense of curiosity that will lead readers to want to discover more. There isn't much else to say without spoilers, so I would recommend this series to middle grade, young adult or teen readers who enjoy fantasy. It is a fun, easy read that I hope you won't regret picking up.",1515974400,4
5790,1057,110,"One of my reading goals this year was to read more classics.  Back in the summer I read Bleak House by Dickens and enjoyed it immensely as I'm a big Dickens fan.  One day while scanning my shelves, Moby Dick seemed to jump out at me and I decided to give it a try.  I'd only heard negative things about it outside of English teachers who declared it a masterpiece but I decided this was the time.

What I never expected to find was how little of the book was about the epic battle between the whale and Captain Ahab.  In a book of around 550 pages, only the last 50 detailed that struggle although it was foreshadowed throughout.  The other thing I never expected was how much I enjoyed this novel.

If you ever wanted to know anything about whaling, this was your textbook.  The author spends pages detailing the types of whales, the skeletal features of whales, what whales ate, how they swam and their family lives.  He went into the same detail about the whaling industry, talking about what the sailors specifically did, what they ate, their relationships, their weapons, etc.  It is one of the most detailed looks at a topic I've ever seen examined.

Then there is the epic struggle.  No one who is a Type A can fail to relate to Captain Ahab.  That monomaniacal determination to win against all odds and no matter what the cost is what propels society forward and what leads to epic tragedies.  I didn't come away loving him, but boy did I relate to him.

Bottom line is that it was definitely a wonderful reading experience.  This novel won't be for everyone but those who power through to the end will have a marvelous time.  This book is recommended for readers of literary fiction, those interested in the whaling industry and those struggling with control issues.",1515974400,5
5791,494,1755,"This book is pretty much a one-stop planning assistant; it contains everything you need to make the right choices when planning your Walt Disney World Vacation.  Unlike the sponsored guides like Birnbaums, the authors are given free reign to give honest evaluations that aren't all rainbows and unicorns.  You'll get the most out of it if you read BEFORE you book your trip since it contains really useful information such as resort information, crowds, weather, dining, and more.  More importantly, there's no fluff.  The authors have really thought long and hard over each edition on what to include and what to leave out to ensure you aren't overwhelmed.

Families have two great options when planning a WDW vacation: use a respected travel agent or resources like this book. Those that prefer to make the decisions themselves will appreciate what this book offers. Those that are overwhelmed by all the choices will likely find a travel agent most helpful.  A travel agent can help find deals better and they can also use their clout if something goes wrong while you are on your vacation in Florida.  But this book gives you all you need to plan out your day, which rides to go on and when, and how to make the most of the trip once you are there.  If anything, a travel agent AND this book are a great way to ensure a really successful and less stressful trip. But I have admittedly never needed a travel agent and really prefer to do all the planning myself so I can tailor it most effectively to what I want to get out of my vacation.

I bought my first Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World back in 1993 for a honeymoon trip.  The information from that earlier edition was incredibly valuable - it helped me save time and money and made the vacation that much better as a result.  I learned how to avoid long wait times for attractions as well as which restaurants are worth my time and which are not.  Now, returning for the first time since 1993, it was a no brainer to get this book.  I have to say that the difference between then and now is social media:  I can youtube to see walking tours of the resorts and what the rooms look like as well as go on Facebook forums like the Walt Disney World Insider to ask questions in real time and get immediate answers and opinions.  Anything the book doesn't cover I can find out immediately in a forum or video.  As well, just following Vloggers as they visit the Parks really helps me decide which rides to Fast Pass and how to navigate/enjoy the Walt Disney World Experience.

As in 1993, my 2018 trip was a success thanks in no small part to having purchased and read this book.  Since I was going with my niece and nephew, I also purchased the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World With Kids, which had a bit more information on caring for and keeping young ones happy.  Considering the cost of the vacation and how things can get very expensive, time consuming, stressful, or unhappy fast, this is probably the best dollars I've ever put into a vacation.

Of note is that those who want more personalized attention can subscribe to the book's online sight for ten dollars or so. It gives you a planning countdown to-do list, at the moment crowd estimates, ability to fax your resort in advance for room requests (as well as room pictures), and more. You get email updates when park opening hours change, rides are closed, and more. You definitely don't need to spend the money on the upgrade since the Facebook forums are so useful for asking questions and because the website feels primitive and can be difficult to use.  I did get some use out of that ten dollars but learned a lot more from the Facebook forums, to be honest.",1515974400,5

5793,387,1540,"I had a hard time getting into this book at first. The characters were so completely spoiled, self-centered, entitled, and obnoxious! And the husband progressively got worse as the story went on. He was a completely despicable person!

It wasn't until the last 25% of the book that the story started to get interesting.

This was set mostly in 1942-1945, one of my favorite time periods, but the war was more of an afterthought, and had little to do with the story. The whole loch ness monster focus was pretty stupid and annoying. I read the book in spite of that.

Pretty book cover, but disappointing story except for the last 25%. Barely qualifies as WWII story. False advertising.",1515974400,3

5795,263,246,"Theres a famous quote that has been attributed to various individuals, including both Mark Twain and Blaise Pascal. The wording varies, but the gist is: Sorry for writing you a long letter, I didn't have time to write a short one.  While its a witty comment, the humorous subversion of expectations doesnt mean theres not an underlying truth. It takes work and / or brilliance to convey an idea persuasively with few words.  A Christmas Carol is an outstanding example of a tight story that powerfully conveys its theme.

Ebenezer Scrooge is a cranky banker who wants nothing to do Christmas. He won't give his employee, Bob Cratchit, time off so that Cratchit can spend the holiday with his familyincluding his ailing son Tiny Tim. He chases off charities. He won't even accept an invitation to attend the Christmas party thrown by his nephew, Fred. Then one night, hes visited by the ghost of his recently deceased business partnerJacob Marley.  Marley, who was as cheap and crotchety as Scrooge, is burdened with horrifying chains, and the ghost warns Scrooge that if the old man doesnt change his ways, hetoowill end up wandering through eternity in a similar set of chains. Before disappearing, Marley tells Scrooge to expect visits from three more ghosts.

The three subsequent visits with the famous ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future don't require much discussion. First of all, the names of the ghosts (e.g. Ghost of Christmas Past) are self-explanatory. Secondly, this story is iconic in pop culture and its been remade in every medium in every way imaginable from modern adaptations (e.g. Scrooged) to Simpsons episodes.  At any rate, the first ghost shows Scrooge that there was a time when he wasn't such a curmudgeon while reminding him that he once had an employer, the beloved Mr. Fezziwig, who was a much better to Scrooge than Scrooge is to Bob Cratchit.  The second ghost takes him to see the Cratchits and their meager but blissful Christmas festivities and then to his Nephews party as well.  The final apparition, The Ghost of Christmas Future, takes Scrooge to the end of his own line.  In the wake of the four ghost visits, Scrooge makes some changes to avoid the fate hes been shown.

The Puffin Classics version that I read has an introduction by Anthony Horowitz and some artwork. That said, I don't think it matters much what version one reads. Its about the story.

5801,1057,1265,"England in the 1520's was a country in turmoil.  Henry VIII was the king but has failed in one of his main duties; providing a male heir to continue his dynasty after his death.  He married his brother's widow, Katherine from Spain, but the marriage has produced no male heirs.  As he nears his late thirties, he becomes restless and Anne Boleyn, a lady in his court, catches his eye.  As he becomes more and more entranced with her, he determines that he will put aside his wife and make Anne his queen instead.  But how is this to be accomplished?  He puts his main advisor, Cardinal Wolsey to the task of requesting an annulment of his marriage from the Pope.

When the Pope refuses to grant the annulment, chaos erupts.  Henry decides to break with the Church and marry Anne anyway.  Wolsey is stripped of his possessions and sent to exile and later killed for his failures.  His staff remains loyal to him and none is more loyal than Thomas Cromwell.  Thomas was not born to a noble family.  He was a blacksmith's son who has made his way up in society by sheer effort and intelligence.  He spends time in Europe as a soldier and then makes his fortune in importing fabrics and other goods.  He is fiercely loyal to Wolsey and when his mentor is disgraced and killed, he is determined to bring that same ruin on the individuals who oversaw Wolsey's ruin.

Henry likes Cromwell, as do many people.  Fiercely loyal and ruthless, he is also charming.  He sees the conspiracies of royal life and can thread his way between them, always pursuing his ultimate goals.  He pushes through various laws to support Henry's desires and mentors many young people in his household.  But more than anything, he works to ruin those who cross him and who dare to stand in the way of the king's desires.

There is little new that could be said about Wolf Hall.  Winner of the 2009 Booker Prize, along with other literary awards, this novel has been praised as a fascinating new look at one of the most written about periods in English history.  Many know little about Cromwell and his place in this drama, and Mantel brings him to life in such a way that the common opinion of him is set on its head.  This is an excellent book and one that richly deserved its accolades.  This book is recommended for readers of historical fiction and those interested in character delineation.",1515974400,5

5803,437,309,"""Fortune favors the flirtatious""

This was literally not what I was expecting at all when I opened this book. I expected a light-heartedhistorical fiction but, what I got was a wild adventure filled with angst, fighting, crazy dukes and kids, a cure-all heart, pirates, and kissing lots of kissing. We follow Henry 'Monty' Montague as he, his sister, and best friend Percy as they go on a Grand Tour. This was such a surprise and Iam so happy I finally read this wonderful tale and got to endeavor in the adventures with Monty. I loved the characters in this book, the plot, the romance, and everything. I really enjoyed how Monty mentioned morning breath in the beginning because it made the story so real to me and mention of a girls monthly cycle. I really hated his father and how terrible of a person he was. He was extremely abusive and homophobic and a raging hypocrite (don't want to say because spoilers.) This book was beautiful and lovely and honestly just read it.

1) Characters

""It's like being set aflame. More than thatit's like stars exploding, heavens on fire. Kissing Percy is an incredible thing.""

They were so lovable and adorable. Felicity is apparentlya canon ACE character. I enjoyed how smart she was and how she was a reader. I didn't like how much she reminded me of Monty's dad with how cruel she could be. The Min character Monty was bi and he was aggressivelybi. Meaning he had no shame and the author let him be what he was. He liked men and women and he talked about his like of both she really represented what he was really well. I loved his spirit and how young, wild, and free he was but we also saw a lot of his inner struggle with himself. He was extremely self-conscious, worrying if he was doing the wrong thing, and flinching at everything if someone raised their hands at him all because of the abuse from his dad. I loved his quicksilver tongue and his melodrama at times. I just wanted to protect him. Percy was his perfect balance. He was the calm to his storm. Percy was biracial, dealt with racism, and epilepsy. I felt the author dealt really well with these topics. He was so cute and adorable and I just want him to live his best life. The pirates were also black and they were so cool.

2) Writing/World Building

""I want to run away right then but there's just Percy in the cabin and water on either side, and the person I most want to run away from is me.""

From the start of this book, I was laughing. The author's dialogue between characters made me laugh, cry, scream, feel joy and everything. It was witty, sexy, cute, fun, and adventurous. I really like how the author was very authentic with the time period and the Europen aesthetic. It was true to the time period in dealing with queer culture, racism, the slave trade, pirates, the grand tour, the aristocrats, and setting. I also like how the author handled it and made it very real especially with Monty not understanding the aspects of racism because for him Percy is just Percy and his love.

3) Romance

You might be the only person left on earth who thinks me decent. Between us, I feel his knuckles brush mine. Perhaps its by chance, but it feels more like a question, and when I spread my fingers in answer, his hand slides into mine. Then everyone else doesnt know you.

Monty is in love with Percy but their friendship is also so cute and pure. The poem was literally the start of everything and my heart was swelling especially with the first kiss. But there was also angsty tension and I love and hate it. I love everything about them and I SCREAMED because Mackenzi Lee is writing a novella for them and yes. I love page 308, 362, 488, 494, and 497.

4) Plot

Simple...You have your skills and I have mine

The plot of this went from such a simple tour around Europe to a wild adventure goose chase. This was so much fun and a lot of action. The pacing was great and I loved all the plot twists. It really left me shook.

Read this I can't say it enough the book is so awesome and fun. I guarantee you will love it if you don't I don't know what is wrong with you. Hope you enjoyed this if you read it what did you think?",1515974400,5
5804,520,819,"I thought this book was a lot of fun and I couldn't flip the pages fast enough.

Anna Fox suffers from agoraphobia and hasn't left the house in 10 months. We know something tragic in her life has happened to cause this because she had been a successful child psychologist before becoming house bound. Poor Anna also suffers from depression and alcoholism which she mixes with various anti-psychotics she's been prescribed by her doctor. She spends her days in a lonely self medicated haze.

A new family has moved in next door and Anna decides to watch them from her windows as she does with all her neighbors. Figuring out their schedules on any given day. One day she witnesses a tragic event and here is where the story really starts to ramp up.

I love unreliable narrators so much and Anna fits the bill perfectly. Is she just wasted on wine & pills, is she hallucinating, completely delusional or is she right about everything? You'll have to read it to find out. I will say upon completion that I really started to care about Anna. What she had been through is devastating which made her more sympathetic, I think.

5808,45,1654,"It is always interesting when two characters have a joint past and come together years later.  In this case, Leonie was a 17 year old girl when she met Roman in India.  He had a rising career as an officer when he dueled with a fellow officer and killed him.  After that, his career was blocked.  Leonie was in the middle of the fight but actually, she was the one who had shot the other officer after he had raped her.  To save her reputation, Roman took the blame and her family whisked her off to London.  Five years later, Roman returns to England with a title of Earl but a ton of debts.  The only way out was to marry an heiress and guess who happened to be one - and who owed him for saving her reputation.
As an interesting character twist, Leonie took to taking a nip now and them, when she couldn't sleep or when she was nervous.  Her drinking didn't really seem to be a problem until she passed out at her wedding.  Roman realizes that he loves her but doesn't know if he can trust her to not drink.

5813,742,385,"Wow! As a World War II buff and an avid fiction reader this book came under my critical scrutiny and emerged as a winner! American born Jessica Shattuck has dealt with guilt dealing with her Nazi relatives in the Reich. In this novel she focuses her considerable novelistic focus on three amazing women in a time little explored by Americans.
  The story deals with the widows of three conspirators in the failed plot of July 20, 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler. All of the husbands have been brutally executed in a wave of Nazi revenge. The women have survived the war. One of them the redoubtable Marianne von Lingenfels is living in her ancient family castle in Bavaria. She eventually takes in two more widows of the failed assassins. Benita is a beautiful woman whose husband Connie (nickname) was a brave conspirator vs. Hitler but also a womanizer. She has a intelligent son named Martin who later emigrates to the USA and is the most outstanding of the children of the women. The other woman Ania  will become a farmer's wife. She has a secret about her past. She cared for children who were later sent to extermination camps. All  of the women deal with issues of guilt and love. The novel is somber and reflective. Is guilt ever forgiven? The novel explores the generation of people who grew up under Nazi rule and somehow survived the war with their bodies intact but their emotional lives in shatters.
  The novel is beautifully written and would make a fine motion picture with the right cast and director. Her descriptions of nature and understanding of this period of time is superb. Shattuck researched and wrote the book over a long seven year period. One of the best novels of the year!",1516060800,5
5814,129,1697,"I know a lot of people loved this story and when I first read the synopsis, I was fairly excited. Somehow, when it came time to read it, I was never quite in the mood for it and as the days after the release days passed, I decided to just sit down and start it.

Jules is a decent enough MC. Shes loyal and curious and I did like her, but didn't love her. Shes sort of bland and forgettable; perhaps thats on purpose. There are several other characters, but no one really stood out to me and the maybe-romance didn't do a thing for me.

Plot wise, it seemed slow. Sure, things are happening, yet several scenes felt repetitive. I never got the jolt of excitement I was looking for with such a unique storyline. As the ending got closer and several back to back reveals happened, I was fully invested. The last 15% is what made this a 3 star review, instead of a 2 star.

Overall, its an interesting concept. The execution didn't really work for me, but the epilogue and the set up for book 2 were intriguing enough to get me to read the next book.

5817,305,745,"It is not often that I explore childrens fiction and this is my first time attempting a review of one on BVT. But when I picked up this classic by Roald Dahl, I knew I would have to talk about it! I owe my experience to my current reading challenge, as that is how James and the Giant Peach landed in my hands.

2018 Popsugar Reading Challenge Prompt: A childhood classic youve never read

My previous experience with Dahls work was limited to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Which I personally adore and could spend the day doting on. I knew that his whimsical style would agree with me. My only regret is having waited this long to enjoy this beloved story.

James loses his parents in a horrendous accident involving a rhinoceros, immediately adding that elaborate flair that only Dahl can, and is sent to live with two terrible aunts; Spiker and Sponge. He is mistreated and neglected, spending his days catering to the unrealistic whims of the two women, when one day he encounters a mysterious man. He is given a bag of magical crystals which promise to be his salvation. When he accidentally drops them into the grown by an old peach tree, the very unexpected happens. Suddenly a peach appears and grows at an alarming rate to the size of a house. Inhabited by over-sized creatures including a centipede, lady bug, spider and earth worm, James finds himself on an incredible adventure when the peachs stem breaks setting them all in motion.

There are a whole lot of things in this world of ours you haven't even started wondering about yet.

James and the Giant Peach is a shining example of why I adore childrens fantasy. It embodies all of the elements I have come to cherish in stories, even as an adult. We are introduced to a lovable yet surely down on his luck protagonist, who is about to find his terrible life flipped upside down for the better! Add a very eccentric cast of characters to the mix and this is a recipe for fun that appeals to readers of all ages.

While the end result is full of whimsy and merriment, it is not without a few defining and more disturbing moments. I am noticing that this seems to be Dahls shtick.

The peach rolled on. And behind it, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker lay ironed out upon the grass as flat and thin and lifeless as a couple of paper dolls cut out of a picture book.

He has the uncanny ability to introduce readers into elaborately constructed worlds that seem to create a perfect balance between awful and the good. I find this a highly effective approach that really feeds the adventure.

While it can feel peculiar at the best of times and perhaps perplexing, tucked within is a beautiful story that reminds children of all ages, that happiness and love can be found within the most unexpected places and forms. James ability to overcome each obstacle reminds us to never lose hope. I cannot wait to explore more of Dahls collection and feel slightly disappointed that I missed these books as a child.",1516060800,5

5819,319,78,"Title: Anne of Green Gables
Author: L.M. Montgomery
Read by: Laurel Schroeder
Publisher: Spoken Realms
Length: Approximately 9 hours and 48 minutes
Source: Review Copy from Audiobook Jukebox  Thank-you!

Anne of Green Gables is one of my favorite novels of all time, and the 1980s mini-series is one of my favorite shows of all time.  L.M. Montgomery also ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors.  I trolled bookstores for years looking for any books of hers that I did not own.  Throughout the 90s they slowly released short story collections.  I believe I have the entire L.M. Montgomery collection in paperback now waiting for Penelope to read and for me to re-read.  I wish they were in hard cover!

Although Ive read the entire L.M. Montgomery collection, I have never listened to any L.M. Montgomery audiobooks.  I was happy to be able to review this audiobook of Anne of Green Gables.  Its been quite a few years since Ive read the novel so it was wonderful to immerse myself back into the world of Anne.

Anne Shirley is a 12-year old orphan.  Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert are siblings looking to adopt a boy to help Matthew out with the farm work.
Anne is sent by mistake, but they find themselves unwilling to send her back, a decision they never regret.  Anne is full of imagination and soon becomes bosom friends with neighbor Diana Berry and rivals with Gilbert Blythe.  Anne often gets herself into scrapes and she is very dramatic which is highly amusing.  Shes also a hard worker and moves from being a 12 year old to going on to Queens Academy for high school.

Listening to this tale, I remembered again why I love this book so much.  Montgomery has vividly drawn the characters and the entire community of Avonlea very lovingly.  The characters are three dimensional and I could relate with them or think of people I know like them.  I love that there is a lot of humor in the tale to make me laugh.

This was a good audiobook to get me occupied on my long drive to Milwaukee for work.  I must admit though that I had a hard time getting into this narrators version.  She had a strange lilt at the end of each sentence that drove me silently insane for a while.  Then I slowly grew used to it and to her acting of each character and I had a fine time listening to it.

One part of the story I found kind of strange now as an adult is when Anne first starts school and her teacher, Mr. Phillips, is always flirting over the top with a student, Prissy. Marilla tells Anne not to question the teacher, but this seemed really inappropriate to me.  How times change!

Favorite Quotes:

I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.

Life is worth living as long as there's a laugh in it.

True friends are always together in spirit.

Oh, it's delightful to have ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to be any end to them-- that's the best of it. Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does make life so interesting.

Overall, Anne of Green Gables is as much of a delight to read as an adult as it was when I was a child.  I loved it and it is an intriguing story to listen to on audio.",1516060800,5

5822,571,218,"I Know My Name by C.J. Cooke is one of those books that instantly, from the very first page makes me curious and engrossed. I'm really impressed with the fact that this is C.J. Cooke's first book. The writing pulls you in and to be honest, I had some serious problems with closing the book, despite the fact that I needed to get up early and the time just disappeared while I was reading the book.

The story shifts focus between Lochlan who discovers that his wife has gone missing without a trace, and a woman that is washed up on the shore of a remote Greek island with amnesia. This seems like a straightforward story, but is it really so? Without giving away too much, did I as the story progressed suspect how it would turn out, and yeah, I was on the right track. However, that only made the story more interesting to read, to see if I was right. I was also thrilled to read a book where the husband wasn't treated as a suspect from the very first minute. I could clearly picture how he would have to get on the run to find his wife to prove that he was innocent, but that never happened and that made me very glad.

I also found the ending to be very satisfying, and once again I face the trouble of trying to explain why without giving the story away. It's just that it could have ended more abrupt when Lochlan learns the truth, etc. However, the epilogue gives a more satisfying ending.

All and all is this a great book and I can't wait to read more books by C.J. Cooke.",1516060800,4

5824,1059,51,"I started out this book hating Hannah Baker. A typical selfish high school girl who refused to think about anything other than how life affected her. But my hate has digressed to a simple dislike, the way I dislike most teenagers in general. Because that's what this book is about: typical teenagers who think that life revolves around them. I was a teenager once and I spent 3 years teaching teenagers. I was bullied in junior high and high school, some of it aggressive, some of it passive. But I have no sympathy for Hannah, or for any of the characters in this book. That's life! Life isn't far, so get used to it! Hannah wasn't the only coward in this book, I'll admit that. Honestly the only 2 characters I liked were Clay and Mr. Porter. I understood Mr. Porter because I've been in his position. He's not completely off the hook, he probably should have probed a little more, but I refuse to blame him for Hannah's choice because that's not fair, just like life. It just amazes me how dramatic teenagers are! And looking back at how dramatic I was before real life kicked me in the butt! If Hannah thought high school boys making a big deal about her ass was a reason she should kill herself, well then she really never would have made it out in the real world! And she never actually said no. Of course the guy was wrong and a pig, but she didn't say no. What was he supposed to think when she didn't resist? Hes a teenage jock! He thought she enjoyed it! And oh no! Her friends stopped hanging out with her! Do you know how many friends have come and gone in my life? And how many of them hurt me on their way out? This is a book about a bunch of stupid teenagers. Nothing more, nothing less. And each generation of teenagers gets dumber and dumber. They are coddled, given their safe spaces, allowed to do whatever they want, never held to a high standard, and they're all idiots. Whatever happened to growing up is hard? My parents told me that. And suicide never once entered my mind in high school. I tell any teenager I know that high school is tough, growing up is tough, life is tough. Just hold your head up, take each problem as it comes, and enjoy the good times, because youll have plenty of those too. Normally, I would ask, where are her parents?, but in this case, all they really could have done was to tell Hannah thats she being overdramatic. Her suicide should never have happened because there was no real cause. Teenagers being teenagers. And if teenagers don't learn to deal with that kind of stupidity, youll either have this situation or them growing up to be stupid adults.
I would never allow any kid I know to read this book, in fact, I wouldn't want most adults I know to read this book. This book teaches that teenagers are whiny, self-centered, and always looking for the easy way out. Nearly every situation in this book is one that we all face on a daily basis. Suicide shouldnt be a concept that anyone should even consider, let alone introducing it to a kid. I think this book was written for teachers, because I have no problem saying that teachers can never be too aware. Or parents, who never grew out of their teenage ways and try to take the easy way out by letting their kids raise themselves. I've seen too many of both groups. But I'll admit, I read this book in 24 hours because it intrigued me, it was written very well, and I liked the anticipation.",1516060800,4

5827,210,323,"Weighing in at 885 pages The Winds of War is epic in every sense of the word.  As I worked through those pages sometimes it felt like it was never going to end, and I never wanted it to.  The story follows the Henry family through the years immediately before the start of the second world war through the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Wouk covers a lot of ground and he manages this by the clever device of following the family patriarch, Victor Pug Henry, through the ups and downs of his naval career.

The book could easily have taken on a Forest Gump type quality, making it seem like the hapless Pug just fell into these situations that allowed the reader to be where all the action was in following the trajectory of the war.  Fortunately, Pug Henry is a likeable and competent character.  Indeed, his stalwart approach to his life and to his work make him both charming and an eminently reliable pivot for the story.  Pug manages to personally meet all of the major political figures of the war  Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin and even Mussolini  but even his wife does not know this.  He is modest and circumspect and clever.  This might have all become a bit too neat, so Wouk also follows the Henry children, who are all young adults in this time period to give us a more complete picture of the war.  In this way, Wouk captures the massive social upheaval and the mood of the American public during the war and also allows us to visit those theatres of action that Pug cannot reasonably be.

The book is made epic, engaging and heartfelt by Wouks weaving of world historical events into the personal lives of the Henry family members.  The scope and impact of the war is brought home to the reader through the story of each of the Henrys.  Wouk, who is remarkably still alive at 102, manages to cover all of the major events of the war, several battles, and the home front.  It is an amazing feat in terms of historical coverage, but also in how much he made me care for these fictional characters.  It truly was a different time. Men and women behaved differently than they do now.  Standards and expectations were different and it was fascinating to observe.  Just as it was fascinating to observe the way the war changed these things.

I would have been more than a little sad when I got to the end, except that the even longer sequel, War and Remembrance awaited me.",1516060800,5
5828,706,496,"Captain Jefferson Kidd is over seventy years old and travels post-Civil War Texas reading news articles to small-town residents willing to spend a dime to hear him.  Hes bored and lonely, but he reluctantly takes on the task of delivering a 10-year-old girl, Johanna, held captive by the Kiowa since she was 6, to her aunt and uncle 400 miles away.  The Kiowa killed her parents and younger sister during the raid in which Johanna was abducted.  Having been uprooted a second time, Johanna is not a happy camper.  This novel is a rollicking ride as this unlikely pair become acquainted, thanks to endless patience and understanding on the Captains part.  A good old-fashioned shootout along the way is the highlight of their journey, but there are several adventures, shady characters, and downright cruel people.  At just over 200 pages, this book is a very fast read and left me wanting more from this author, but, alas, Ive read three others of hers already.  Although the plot is somewhat formulaic, this may be my favorite Jiles novel so far.  Johanna is a noble savage of sorts, and the Captain shares his wise musings throughout:
The boys all grow up together and then they become young men and they fight, at first in play, and then somebody gets hurt, and before you know it the revenge drama is on.
My favorite conflict in the novel, though, is between the Captain and audience members in every town who bait him to take sides in a heated political debate.  He demurs time and time again, but he cant prevent the ensuing mayhem.  When its time to skedaddle in the dead of night, Johanna rolls with it, more accustomed to a night on the road than a night in a hotel.  She may be a handful, but shes plucky and has some tricks up her sleeve, proving to the Captain that he can be both student and teacher.",1516060800,5

Maureen Johnson is one of my favorite YA authors. Not only have I devoured and loved the majority of her YA contemporary books (The Key to Everything, 13 Little Blue Envelopes, The Last Little Blue Envelope, and Girl At Sea), but they've always toped my ""best of"" lists. Therefore, when I caught wind that she was releasing a new series - one focusing on a teenage sleuth, a decades old murder mystery, and a boarding school setting - I was jumping-up-and-down-can't-contain-my-happiness excited. I had high hopes; however, I had faith that Maureen would deliver.

As it turns out I was one 100% right. Truly Devious just may be Maureen's best work yet! Suspenseful, swoony, and incredibly well written, Truly Devious is a wild ride from start to finish.

Truly Devious beautifully blends together two murder mysteries - one from the past as well as one from the present. At first I didn't know how Maureen was possibly going to stretch the murder mysteries over three books; however, now that I've finished the book it's crystal clear. There's A LOT at play and I can't wait to see how it unravels.

Both mysteries are nail-bitting/edge-of-my-seat suspenseful. There's so many twists, so many turns, and so many more connections than I could have ever possibly imagined. Out of the two, however, I think the one from the past hooked me in the most. For one, I enjoyed the flashbacks Maureen offered. It gave insight to the key players from that fateful day - Albert Ellingham, the butler, the FBI detail assigned to Albert, etc -  and each ""confessional"" introduced an exciting new clue. I also liked that details surrounding the case where slowly revealed. It offered up an extra dose of suspense, especially when Stevie took it upon herself to ""re-open"" the case.

The setting also added a layer of chill to the novel. Ellingham Academy is by no means your typical boarding school. It's located in the middle of nowhere, cut-off from civilization in many facets. It also contains crazy artwork, secret hideaways/passages, and a mega mansion. Maureen did such a fantastic job of setting the scene.

Stevie is great lead!  She's smart, funny, and utterly charming. When the story begins, Stevie is beyond ready to have a fresh start. She never fit in well at home - her conservative parents never understand her, she always does or says the wrong thing, and the majority of her friends are online rather than in person. At Ellingham Acadmey Stevie slowly starts to get comfortable, finding an unexpected home. She makes friends, pursues a boy, and learns how to speak up for herself. I clicked with her from the start, and I loved seeing her embark on this journey.  In addition to Stevie, I enjoyed the wide variety of other characters introduced in the past as well as the present. There were unique as well as complex. My favorite of the bunch, though, is Stevie's love interest. I could never quite figure him out but I loved how he made Stevie more adventurous, more willing to go with the flow.

Overall, Truly Devious is yet another stellar book by Maureen, and given the crazy, I-can't-believe-this-is-happening ending I can't wait to see where it goes next.",1516060800,5

I am a huge true crime fan, so I was all over this story.

Love love loved Stevie and this cast of characters. Shes smart and maybe a bit odd and socially awkward, but I loved being in her head. The rest of the cast is just as equally intriguing and I immediately didn't trust anyone.

Plot wise, its captivating. The story is told in two threads: the story of Albert Ellingham, his family, and those events + the current timeline. It was an effective way to get the information without an info dump. The story kept me guessing until the very end, which is when I nearly threw my kindle. Everyone make way for an epic cliffhanger.

Overall, I enjoyed the story and the characters. My main complaint is the last few pages of the last chapter. I was left throughly unsatisfied and would do horrible things for book two.

He's surprised to find the innkeeper is a girl from high school, Lotti Hartford. There's a past between them; they each lost their virginity together, but then separated when Lotti's family moved away.
This is a quick read and cute like all Ms. Shalvis's works. I found it unsatisfying though as everything happens so fast. Both Sean and Lotti talk a lot about how they've changed over the years, so I wasn't convinced they could so quickly fall back in love with the other, especially as they'd been sixteen the last time they saw each other. It felt more like Sean wanted what his brother had, and Lotti was still reeling from her father's death and the breakup of her own engagement than that they knew each other well enough now to get together. It was an okay story, but not one of her best.",1516060800,3
5833,790,1542,"Recently a friend asked whether I have read any of the 19 Sigma Force novels by James Rollins and the answer was no. Not sure why not considering author Rollins is a #1 New York Times Best Selling Author. Perhaps because this reader is busy enough with his extended group of favored authors, that there was no interest is starting with someone new. Still, there was that curiosity of discovery, so author Rollins latest The Demon Crown was obtained.

The Sigma Force is an elite unit of the US Defense Department whose body consists of former Special Forces officers trained in multiple scientific fields and are used in national and international emergencies. When Hawaii is attacked by swarms of wasps, the Sigma Force responds. These are not normal wasps, but ancient wasps who have been dormant, but now brought back to life. When they attack humans and animals the sting will inject their larva, which will eventually move into the bone marrow and thus eating the person or animal from the inside. Ugh.

A sinister Japanese corporate executive, who was involved with the covert biological and chemical warfare on Chinese during WWII, wants to regain the Imperial Japan of the past and has the means to do so, unless he can be stopped. The Sigma Force only has three days to solve this problem, and thus the rollercoaster ride of a story takes off.

Rollins uses a combination of historical fact, a strong dosage of science, a lively sense of imagination and some just too crazy situations to be believed. Still it was a lot of fun reading and perhaps learned more about wasps than I cared to know. The writing is similar to that of Steve Berry only with a stronger focus on science.

5836,751,1756,"Albert Ellingham opened a free school for the gifted in the 1930s, a magical place for high school juniors and seniors who just weren't getting the attention they needed in the public school system. But not just anybody could get inyou had to appeal and be selected. In 1936, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The case was never solved.

Flash forward to present-day, when Stevie Bell finds herself accepted into Ellingham Academy. Its been decades since the famous Ellingham kidnapping occurred, and everyone involved is long dead, but for Stevie, the mystery is very much alive and well. Stevies not sure why shes been accepted to this school for the giftedshes just an ordinary girl who likes mysteries. Shes determined to solve the Ellingham case, but winds up starring in a murder mystery of her own.

Truly Devious is a pretty fantastic book. Its told in third-person through alternating chapters, flashing back and forth between 1936 and present-day. Half of the book focuses on the events that transpired with the Ellinghams, and the other half follows Stevie and her friends experiencing their own murder mystery. So, in essence, you're getting two mysteries for the price of one! And both cases are tough to figure out, I must say.

I was a little hesitant at first, seeing the alternating chapters, because I usually find this to be quite unnecessary, but it worked well in this YA mystery. Both sets of characters are interesting, both mysteries are intriguing, and, the best part: neither are truly solved by the end of the book! An ominous To be continued concludes the book, and Im surprised to find myself desperate for more! I went into this book with little enthusiasm and finished it with unanswered questions and a lot of love.

What I really like, though, is that people actually die in this book. Okay, that sounded a bit morbid. What I mean is, typically, YA mysteries are watered down. Like, theres an initial murder, setting off the mystery and suspense and blah blah, but I never really experience much suspense and never truly have any fear for the characters because everyone is almost always safe. No one else dies. The mystery is solved and served in a neat little bow. Truly Devious strays from that boring trope and actually has suspense and death. I loved it. It also heavily focuses on the aftermath of those deaths, rather than quickly glossing over the emotional stuff and just trying to keep up that suspenseful pace. I liked seeing the anxiety, the fear, and the sadness; I liked seeing the characters struggle and try to deal with it all. And speaking of

WHAT A FANTASTIC, DIVERSE CAST OF CHARACTERS. Seriously. I applaud Johnson for including characters of various ethnicities, races, sexual orientations, and states of mental health. This is a big reason I really love YA as a genrethe writers are socially aware and inclusive, and it warms my heart on this cold, winter day.

Take the main character, Stevie, for example. She has anxiety. And Johnson perfectly exemplifies anxiety, in words, which I myself struggle with (hell, I cant even verbally explain it, so yeah, kudos). It was really relatable. I like Stevie and would easily say shes one of my favorite narrators to date. I loved following her adventure, solving mysteries and navigating the rough waters of physical attraction and social encounters and such. I have a lot of love for Stevie.

I actually really enjoyed every character, in their own unique ways. Thats rare for meto legitimately like every single character in a book. Which is why having any of them die is so painful for me! My babies! I definitely relate to Nate and am in love with him. David I was not a fan of, but slowly warmed up to him and, towards the middle, loved his sense of humor. If for anything, just read this book for the characters.

I first encountered Maureen Johnson in Let It Snow, the holiday romance novel also featuring Lauren Myracle and John Green. I loved her part of the novel almost as much as I loved Greens, and thats saying a lot. Reading Truly Devious, I realize just how amazing Maureen Johnson is, and how similar her style is to Greens. Her writing is fantastic, especially the dialogue. She represents teenagers so honestly and accurately. And something I really like is the perfect balance she creates between dialogue, inner monologue, and setting description. Thats not an easy thing to accomplish, but Johnson does it well. I really look forward to the next installment in this book, and its going to be a long time from now since this just came out. Sad face.",1516060800,5
5837,573,653,"I thought this was an intriguing portrayal of a rather influential young woman for the times.  It reads well.

5839,616,1652,"Once again Kasie West has failed to disappoint! At this point I don't even read the blurbs before picking up this authors work because I just know I will find a story that I adore and of course thats exactly how I felt reading this newest novel.

Abby is an artist with lots of dreams for her future. One huge stepping stone she believes will make all the difference is to join a showcase at the very museum where she works. Unfortunately her boss doesnt think her work is quite ready. He claims her work is missing experience, heart, and a certain something to incite emotion. A little crestfallen but determined to prove her worth, Abby creates a list if life experiences she wants to accomplish that summer and who better to help her out than her best friend, Cooper.

This has all the makings of a friends to more romance, a trope I adore. Abby is very much in unrequited love for her best friend, and unlike many stories with this trope, I wasn't sure how this would play out, if Im being honest. Abby had attempted to share her feelings once before and when it was obvious how freaked out her friend became with her declaration, she turned it into a joke and tried to deny those feelings existed ever since. But with their other friends away for the summer, it was destined to be an obstacle for her to overcome and a life experience on her list. Cooper is dating a new girl who isn't so keen on their close relationship and then there is Elliot, a boy with a crush on Abby and seems to be perfect for her in every way. It all got very complicated for me as the story went on. I loved the friendship between Cooper and Abby and couldn't help but hope it would turn into something more. But at some point I sort of accepted the just friends vibe between them. Especially when Abby starts to grow and stand up for herself in a healthy way. And of course Elliot was very sweet and patiently waiting in the background. So yeah, I was a little torn with what exactly I hoped the outcome would be and if I even wanted a romance to come from the story at all. From the outside it sounds like a love triangle sort of deal but Im not so sure it can truly be classified as one. Its resolution felt a little bittersweet and I don't want to say much more without giving away the direction it went.

Besides the romance, I truly adored Abbys list and the experiences she accomplished. She really put herself out there and tried new things, things that scared her but made her feel more alive and helped her build some confidence and strength. She has a very sarcastic personality, one she shares with her grandfather who is someone she is very close to. It wasn't just Abby with obstacles to overcome as we meet her family and the strain on each member from the issues they face. But I was happy to see steps were being made for them all by the end.

I honestly flew through this read as I knew I would. Im extremely excited this will be a crossover series as there are certain characters Im hoping to meet again with their own stories to tell. Definitely worth picking up!",1516060800,4
5840,338,819,"What a great unreliable narrator Anna Fox is!  She is one of the best in a long list of ""unreliable narrator"" books I have read. Although she is a drunk and delusional, you know there has to be some truth in her stories--or there wouldn't be a book centered around her. I was truly enjoying this story until the psychopathic murderer was revealed.  And I had to suspend disbelief and say ""Really? Is that who it was?"" I felt let down and the air was went out of the story.  How did a psychologist not catch the signs?  Oh, that's right:  she's a drunk, a pill popper, and delusional, etc. Anyway, I was happy when the book ended on a note of hope.  That took away some of my disappointment. Still, I look forward to Mr. Finn's next book and see what he comes up.",1516060800,4
5841,112,1477,"Cajun Crazy is book 11 in the Cajun series. This was my first Sandra Hill book and I really enjoyed her writing style. I loved seeing Simone trying to fight off her ""Cajun Crazy"" feelings but knowing there was no real hope. This entire book had a small town feel where everyone knows one another and since I had so much fun with this one it makes me want to read the other books in this series.

Simone LeDeux is a police officer that quits her job and moves back to Louisiana to take care of her mom who is having some health issues. Instead of finding another job on the force, she opens up Legal Belles, a private investigator office with a friend. Most of the cases are catching cheating spouses but there are a few others that are potentially dangerous. Adam Lanier is a single dad and lawyer that helps out Simone in one of these other instances and the sparks are instantly flying. This is a super tight-knit town and the gossip mill is at full speed when Adam and Simone's attraction is easily on display. Adam winds up a bit worried about Simone with a case that hits close to home and I was intrigued to see how it all would play out.

Cajun Crazy is a fun, sexy read you won't want to put down. I really enjoyed the small town aspect with all of the family elements. I'm not too familiar with Cajun lingo but luckily it was explained pretty well throughout the novel. It was a bit heavy on the lingo but I could overlook that considering I couldn't wait to see what would happen with Simone and Adam. All in all, this was a lovely read that I think you'll enjoy if you like Contemporary Romances.",1516060800,4

But the end seemed too draw out some weird moral about it being good to always be wanting, which I didn't like.

5843,616,1698,"I adore books with a romance steming from strangers meeting one night through extraordinary circumstances, especially when it comes to delayed traveling and crazy adventures. In Love and Other Train Wrecks we have two strangers who wound up next to each other on a train that breaks down. They decide to take a risk and embark on a crazy adventure to reach their destinations but didn't plan on the feelings they would develop in the process.

Noah was my favorite of the two characters. He was a little nerdy but pretty adorable and sweet. He is on board the train with an elaborate romantic plan to try to win back his ex and the more we find out the circumstances of their relationship and the breakup, the more we discover its guilt driving him instead of love. It was like we are seeing all of the ways they didn't work as he is realizing it and that just opened his eyes more and more to the girl he is having this adventure with. Ammy was heading to surprise her father at his wedding, burdened with her own guilt of leaving her mother behind in such a fragile state. Her family life is quite complicated and she was struggling with her place among it all. Ammy wasn't quite as likable for me but I understood her motivations though maybe not so much how she went about it. The two of them sort of butt heads at first, and well on and off throughout their adventure, but they decide to work together to reach their destinations, even when fate seems to be throwing them off course at every turn.

As far as the adventure went, I thought it was a lot of fun and I had to laugh at some of the predicaments they got themselves into. The romance felt a little flat to me though. I didn't feel much chemistry between the two of them and perhaps that was because Ammy was a little prickly, especially with all that is going on in her life. The ending felt a little rushed as well and I wanted more from it. But the author was able to create a cute story about letting go and moving on with a little twist thrown in that made the book overall enjoyable.",1516060800,3

5847,230,1150,"I have read some critics who say they prefer Amy Tan's fiction to this book.  I have to disagree.  Great writing is great writing, and fiction or nonfiction are simply incidental categories.  Of course, I am perhaps biased.  I've been enjoying Tan's writing for years now.

I'm also greatly interested in what stories bring writers to the page.  In Where the Past Begins, we learn some of the true stories that informed Tan's fiction, including stories from her family life and accounts of her early days as a creator.

Of particular interest was the author's description of her reaction to initial success.  It takes bravery to tell your own story, and I appreciate that Amy Tan took the leap to do this.  Another feature I enjoyed in this book were the interludes provided between chapters.  Sometimes these were one or two-page follow-ups to the previous entry.  Other times, they were poetic.

5851,1059,1205,"Another doozy of a book! I read Extraordinary Means, also by Schneider, earlier this year and loved it! So I picked up The Beginning of Everything and I loved it almost as much! I did give this book only 4 stars because I find teenage drama annoying. But I don't think the story would have existed without all those high school problems that teenagers believe will just end their lives!! As an adult, I found a lot of those problems petty and easy, compared to real life. However, I do remember being in high school where trying to get people to like me was a full time job. This book was also a little more philosophical than I was expecting. I had no idea what a panopticon was until I read this book. The idea that we are all just living one big surveillance experiment does describe high school efficiently! The book started out with Ezra going from golden boy to social outcast after he is injured in a car accident. He has to deal with all the pity and stares and trying to figure out what his life is now that his old one has been destroyed. He meets Cassidy Thorpe, who is full of mischief and mystery, and like all high schoolers, he falls in love. And everything goes fine, until one crucial detail comes out. I did roll my eyes a little at how dramatic both Ezra and Cassidy can be, thinking that life in high school reflects the rest of your life. But it was an interesting twist that Cassidy resists Ezras glorification of her. She doesnt want the credit of changing him, when, in reality, he was changing himself. Basically this is a book of a bunch of kids learning to grow up and their reactions to having to do so. This is actually a good one for high schoolers to read. The language wasn't bad and any steamy scenes were few and far between, along with not being very detailed. Those who have finished high school will probably read this with amusement. But overall, a very good book!",1516060800,4

5854,15,5,"I finished this book a couple of days ago and I am still unsure of my complete thoughts about it. What I definitely do know is that this is one heck of a book. My reasons for the confusion is probably that I did tend to relate a little too much to Eleanor in parts. Not her childhood and what happened then I hasten to add, but some of the things she does, says and her philosophies on certain things just had me thinking. Her attitudes and mannerisms too. It just all became a little uncomfortable reading for me at times. All this probably meaning that I didn't emotionally engage with the book quite as much as I probably would have if I hadn't made these associations. I sort of read it at a distance if you like. All this waffle probably boils down to one easy conclusion. Eleanor Oliphant came across to me as a completely credible and realistic character and that is down to the author alone.
The story that the author wove around and about the wonderful character of Eleanor was also very well done. Some of the situations that Eleanor found herself in - either by fate or design were describes so well, often also with such emotion that even considering my detachment I couldn't help but feel; especially when she was talking to her Mummy on the phone as I was all too familiar with some of the disparaging remarks being bandied around.
Although a painful read for me, I consider it to also be an important one. It's definitely a book and Eleanor is a character that will stay with me for a while. I am sorry my review is a little strange but I am finding it very hard to put thoughts and feelings about this book into words.

5858,815,3,"This classic Agatha Christie novel follows Hercule Poirot, the great Belgian detective, into the mountains of Eastern Europe where the Orient Express gets stuck in the snow and a dead body appears.

There follows the gathering of evidence, the interviewing of suspects, and the solution of the mystery. All of this happens in the dining car and coach of the Orient Express, in a snowy environment where the international cast of characters is confined to their luxury train. And what a diverse bunch of characters it is, consisting of a British army officer returning home from India, a governess travelling from Iraq, a few Americans, a Princess, and others. It is interesting to follow along on Poirots investigation as he interviews each suspect and then begins slowly revealing his observations and suspicions. He is coy and teasing along with extremely rational in his analysis of all available information.

The conclusion to the puzzle is startling and leads to some interesting commentary on justice. Poirot shows that his true interest is in the intellectual challenge of discovering the precise order of events and not in any deeper question of right and wrong. In some ways this mirrors the desire of the mystery reader and shows Poirot to be at one with the values and priorities of the one holding open the pages of the book.",1516147200,5

With stakes already high, knowing that only one sister can be queen but also that her sister who lose the crown will also lose their lives kept the suspense and tension high right to the end of the book.

5870,667,1759,"A history of the job of human calculators in the US, specifically African American women from the WWII era through the Apollo missions who worked for the NACA base at Langley (which later became NASA and moved most of its operations to Houston). The book looks at the history by following four real African American women who were mathematicians and worked for NACA throughout this time period and made many unsung contributions to the US aeronautical field.

I didn't realize how much history of aeronautics development in WWII and the Cold War space race would be involved in this. Not that that's a bad thing. It is necessary to fully appreciate these women and their contributions to the field of mathematics and science. Really only half of the book is about the women themselves, but it is still an engaging read. It is a great look at some unsung heroes and women who showed that the female mind can be just as brilliant as the male mind when it comes to crunching numbers. Good stuff. This is the young reader's edition so I'm curious to know how it differs in content from the adult version. I feel like I got the full story though and I'm not going to rush out and read the adult one. It definitely should help kids realize they can be anything they want to be.

Notes on content: Racial discrimination and segregation is discussed but no racial slurs are included in the text that I remember. No sexual content.

5873,186,1760,"Terry Pratchett is the master of a fantasy sub-genre that probably belongs to him alone. Most of them are clever, witty, and rapid-fire novels. The Discworld novels fall into different categories: Tiffany Aching, Rincewind, the three witches, Sam Vines and the guards, and Death.  This book is a novel of the three witches. Each book focuses on one of them, although they cross over and pop up in each others' books all the time.  It is best if you start from the beginning of a grouping and work your way through, otherwise you'll miss a lot of inside jokes, references, etc. There are charts on the internet that will show you the groupings. Having said that, I read Wee Free Men first, and it made me a fan. You can trust Terry Pratchett to not be too linear and to not be very predictable. Terry Pratchett does a wonderful job of maintaining the integrity of his absurd world and his characters while keeping everything fresh and creative. The humor is wrapped around serious themes. The characters have fantasy aspects, but they illustrate many universal truths of human nature. I cannot read too many of them in a row, but when I need something different, a Discworld novel is the perfect metaphorical palate refresher.  This story begins with the assignation of a king and the abduction of his infant son. Assassins are following the coach with the baby when they come upon a meeting of witches Nanny Ogg, Granny Weatherwax, and Magrat. They take custody of the baby and hide him and the crown with a traveling troupe of thespians. The tale is full of ghosts, amusing theater references, wicked ambitious royals and, of course, the witches who are reliably entertaining.  Like all the Discworld books, the tone is satirical and clever. This book was not my favorite of the Discworld novels and it did not make me laugh aloud as frequently as Wee Free Men. These books do not contain any scenes, language, or images that would rate even a PG-13 rating at the movies. If a reader does not have sufficient maturity, much of the book will be wasted, because you won't get the jokes or understand the satire.

5880,133,417,"I battled to connect with the characters whose lives on paper lacked depth, so I didn't feel the emotional impact of their fate. This is crazy for me as I am probably one of the most sensitive readers, frequently sobbing over characters and ruining the pages of my books.

The Decker element is also repetitive, explained over and over, and detracts from the characters personal stories. I liked the interaction of Mateo and Rufuss friends throughout the story, but the periphery characters and the way they interweave through their last day seems contrived and, unlike their friends, ultimately didn't add anything to the story.

On a positive note; I love the personal note from Adam Silvera preceding the story giving perspective to the book  I wish more authors did this.

5882,735,123,I enjoy this book. The author is very interesting and insightful and the book is very well researched and well written. This book is important reading for everyone wanting to understand the world we live in. I recommend this book without qualifications. The book is text to speech enabled so you can listen to the book or read the book or both.,1516147200,5
5883,815,61,"This is an intricate, complex, and frigid thriller, a whodunit with a wide variety of likely suspects pursued by a team of investigators from the Oslo Police department, detective Harry Hole among them. His fractured personal life and substance abuse demons ground the book in a world that is modern, up-to-date, and relatable. He pursues a serial killer who is diabolical, mysterious, gruesome and enjoys making snowmen. The novel criss crosses Norway in a variety of ways. It goes from city to town and from TV studio to farm on the lengthy quest to uncover the identity of the so-called Snowman, a revelation which is an amazing surprise. While this book might be lacking in the more literary qualities, it has an interesting cast of characters, a plot which zips along a twisty path, and an atmosphere of grim, snow-blanketed terror which one may find at its best in the Scandinavian detective thriller.",1516147200,5
5884,817,1654,"I received an e-galley from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

TW for rape; Leonie's a rape survivor, and there was an attempted rape in the story as well.
Also TW for alcoholism.

I had to restart this a couple of times because I couldn't connect to the characters or the story. The pacing was a bit slow to start, and Leonie the heroine is a tad prickly for my taste, but I warmed up to her as the story progressed. I love her character growth, and I love how her relationship with Roman developed from two strangers in a marriage of convenience into something solid. That being said, I wish I was a bit more attached to the couple. The budding romance between them is sweet, but I wish I felt more for them.

So excited for Cassandra's story!",1516147200,4

5886,614,1205,"Not terrible but nothing special.

Ezra A junior who has it all, the varsity tennis team, jock friends, popularity and a hottie girlfriend - finds out just how quickly everything can change. Fleeing from a party full of bad news he gets into a hit and run accident, where his knee is crushed and upon returning to school at the start of senior year feels like no part of his past life was there waiting for him.

On the first day of school, Ezra reconnect with an old friend, and there is a new student, Cassidy, and he begins to feel like everything is just beginning. But Cassidy isn't your average girl and things between them are far more complicated than anyone could've ever imagined.

This is a little slow, a little heart breaking, and a little too easy to relate to in that sometimes it's easiest to push people away than to deal with your feelings. The main character is a little bland, his dog is a hero, his childhood best friend.. too good for this world, and Cassidy... well that's up to the reader to decide.",1516147200,3
5887,886,819,"The writing is very good but these psychological thrillers with damaged protagonists and ""surprise"" endings are becoming a little too much. I feel like I am reading yet another variation of Gone Girl/Girl on a Train/Behind Closed Doors or whatever with a damaged, unsympathetic and hard-to-like female narrator. The old movie references got a little tiresome as did the constant wine swilling and pill popping. And shame on the other family for making their problem everyone elses! Better than Woman in Cabin 10 by a huge margin but I wouldn't have missed a thing if I had skipped this book.  Laura Lippman and Karin Slaughter have been doing something similar and superior for years with their stand alones so I recommend skipping this book and going for a more fleshed out, better thought out , more original read.

5889,349,1761,"Usually reading a book mid series creates no problems to a reader unfamiliar with the author. And while I understand the special challenge an author faces of reintroducing the main characters with each new novel in the series, I feel Kellerman comes up short in Bone Box. I am a stranger in a family gathering. I am not properly introduced, so as the story opens, I stumble along, confused about who is who. Add to the problem by the author switching between first and last names and nicknames, and it is like learning a foreign language. Even characters new to the story are called by last names and then first names, adding to the confusion.

The relationships, the chatty conversations, the life styles give a folksy feel, which engages the reader. What is particularly gripping is the detective procedural. Truly awesome in its expert handling. This is what kept me turning pages. Chapter after chapter, the investigation in a cold case seems to go nowhere as our heroes gather evidence. How can they find the murderer when mostly all that remains of the crimes are buried bones?

The pieces connect from apparently unrelated sources as the cold case warms up. And we enjoy some surprises along the way.",1516147200,4
5890,582,1420,"""A soldier, yes. But so young, with so much responsibility. It was a mistake. No matter how strong the person, everyone makes mistakes.""

My thoughts on this read were initially, and have remained quite indifferent. While there were aspects of Zenith that I liked and appreciated, there were equal parts I didn't care for. In the end, these points seemed to have canceled each other out, making it even less impressionable.

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical going into this read (as I always am with Sci-Fi's). This genre varies so much and can be difficult to nail down. While the plot was relatively straightforward, I felt that the minimal world (or worlds, seeing we are in outer space) building and character development were big drawbacks to my liking this read more.

Before I break down the issues I had with the book, I'd like to mention that there are some great qualities here as well. Diversity amongst the characters is obvious. The text touches on a wide berth of character demographics and origins, creating the idea that we are dealing with a large area that the characters originate from. The various backgrounds, specifically with Androma's team, create interesting crew dynamics. While the diversity may not be on the scale of Star Wars, it's something worth noting.

Secondly, I thought the pacing throughout remained consistent. While the book is written with several point-of-views, as well as in different tenses, its consistent helped with delivering a constant, fluid story.

Despite these positive points, there were quite a few things that I didn't care for.

One of the biggest being that the plot was anticlimactic. If there had been a climax, it was ill-placed as there was nothing towards the end to really gear up the pace and intensity. Without a climax, it makes me wonder how this book will move forward? Either the sequel will be jam-packed with action (which it better be to make up for that ending) or it will simply draw out the plot which would have been better to pack it into a stand-alone novel.

Secondly, main characters felt like they were only moderately developed. I would have liked to get to know them more intimately and who they really are. Androma's character works against itself. She's gained the title ""bloody baroness,"" yet, I failed to see the ruthlessness that would accompany such a title? In the instances where she did take someone's life, there was too much work involved to make the reader believe she didn't care about killing another. This forced action and her not-so-bloody-baroness reactions didn't mesh. Other characters remained rather underdeveloped. Characters like Breck and Gilly barely get any singular page-time other than displaying their womanly awesomeness and skills. I think the lack of depth in a majority of the characters ate into the rest of the plot.

The last issue I had was the underdevelopment of the world(s) this takes place in. Clearly, the crew is out in space, so it's not as easy to establish that. However, more time outside the ship and on land of some sort would have helped this along.

Overall, it wasn't a bad read. It felt like it wasn't a complete read, and that something was missing (the climax!) I'm not sure if this is a series I will continue on with or not.

Vulgarity: Quite a bit.
Sexual content: Some, but not with much detail.
Violence: Quite a bit.

My Rating: ",1516147200,3
5891,661,1420,"This book was pretty good. I was a little confused with all the characters, but after a few chapters I started feeling deeper connections with them. Obviously as Andi is the main character, I felt the most connection with her. Andi reminded me a lot of Celaena from Throne of Glass. Andi had something tragic happen in her past that shes trying to run away from. Andi is a person who has taken to killing people (shes a Space Pirate). I loved Andi through and through. She is terribly flawed and that made her all the more appealing to me. The plot was fast paced for me. I didn't want to put the book down. Her mission that she is forced to undertake has made me wonder whats really going on in the galaxy of Mirabel. I have a lot of questions left unanswered, so this makes me excited for the next book. Overall, this is a pretty good action adventure sci-fi novel!",1516147200,4

5894,235,784,"4 not-quite-so-perfect stars to The Perfect Girl    

It only took me a couple pages to get hooked on The Perfect Girl. The structure of the book added to the swift pacing where different points of view were told at two different times - both before and after a murder. The short chapters added to the quick tempo. Lots of surprises, interesting characters, and a birds eye view into this family, all added up to a great book on the whole.

But you know theres but in here somewhere, don't you?  There were a couple loose ends with characters that left me questioning whether some parts of the book were edited out (it is a longer read at over 400 pages), and it felt a little unsettling. For example, a side character discovered a medical condition that was discussed quite a bit, but Im not sure what it added to the story? Also, the ending. The book could have gone out with fireworks , just like it started; but instead, it just fizzled out. If it had ended better, it would have easily been five stars.

Overall, this was a quick read with excellent pacing, and I would definitely be interested in reading other books by Gilly Macmillan.",1516233600,4
5895,531,521,"I was expecting a thoughtful examination of how big data results in a lot of bad information and how to improve its use and get to ""real"" information. Instead, this just reads as the guy showing off the results of his applications of Google tools.  His point that Google searches reveal something we don't admit to others is made (repeatedly) but is one dimensional. For example, increased Google searches for information behind racist thinking doesn't necessarily mean someone's a racist, it could be someone trying to understand racist rationale - this type of more complex, nuanced behavior is never touched upon or even thrown in as a toss-off line to account for it as a possibility for a fraction of said searches....anyway, I don't feel like this is a ""must read"" unless you haven't been on the internet in 4 years.",1516233600,2
5896,902,1730,"How was this my first Susan Wiggs book?! No seriously, shes written more than fifty novels so the fact that I haven't read any of her books before is blowing my mind. Family Tree had everything I look for in womens fiction; a wonderful lead character who you can root for, a story that weaves between the past and present, some mouth watering descriptions of food and a cozy setting in the forests of Vermont. What more could you want?! A dash of romance maybe? No worries, theres that as well and its not the cliched, overdone type of love story, its raw and extremely true to life. Can you tell yet that I really liked this book?

When Annie wakes up after being in a coma for a year there are some huge gaps in her memory and she has a long road to recovery. I adored her, she was upbeat and positive but also sarcastic and snarky which is exactly how I would expect someone in her shoes to behave. This is split pretty equally between Annies life as a teenager and in the present and I liked both timelines equally. I was totally invested in Annie and couldn't wait to see what choices she made and how she moved forward and began anew.

This would be a great choice for a book club, the discussion possibilities are endless. I would start with the food but thats just me. All joking aside there is a strong emotional component to this book that raises many questions about family, love, loss, life and chasing dreams. This was a really easy book to escape into and one that made me a new fan of Wiggs.

Family Tree in three words: Emotive, Delicious, and Genuine.",1516233600,4
5897,700,904,The Catcher in the Rye stands out as a unique work. It is a fantastic coming-of-age read about the stark teenage reality of growing up in New York City. What sets this book apart is that it has a dark story that reflects on how people treat each other. I recently re-read this and was surprised how a book about teenagers written in the 1950s is still relevant today. I think what I got most out of this book was a unique viewpoint about consequences of our actions.  This is a book that everybody should read at least once.,1516233600,3

5901,491,496,"This is a wonderful  exploration of an overlooked corner of history.  I remember reading Conrad Richters A Light in the Forest in junior high  a fine tale exploring the adjustment difficulties of a boy who had been captured by Indians as a child and raised as a member of the tribe, then was returned to his birth family in his teens.  (The book was later made into a Disney movie).  Jiles story tells of a similar case, a young girl captured and raised by the Kiowa Indians who had killed her parents and younger sister.

We are a lot more sophisticated about the long term effects of traumatic shock than we were in Richters time. Johanna has obliterated any memory of her first family and wants only to stay with the Kiowas.  On the northern border of Texas she is given into the reluctant care of an itinerant newsreader for delivery to her relatives near San Antonio.  It is never quite clear why Captain Kidd agrees to take this feral child in hand, but Jiles draws his character so vividly that the reader simply accepts that a combination of loneliness, chivalry, and sympathy for the abandoned and unwanted moves him, and once settled in his purpose, he will not go back.

If you liked Lonesome Dove and other tales of early Texas by Larry McMurtry, you will be excited to discover Paulette Jiles.  She covers some of the same geographic, historic, and social territory with the same earthy reality and sense of expansive self-discover, and with a twist of lyrical description that is her own.",1516233600,5

I was struggling to keep on schedule for my overburdened reviews and when I didn't connect right away with Charlie and Ever, I gave up.

But, I am so damn glad I tried again, because mere pages after my DNF hard stop, I was fully entranced by Charlie and Ever's romance and I couldn't read the pages fast enough.

They're both products of their environment, both working through relationship issues that were ingrained early and often by their parents. But there's just something about the other that they cannot deny--even though those thoughts break all of their internal rules.

I loved seeing them overcome their fears of love. To working through their issues. Their banter was so fun and sexy and their in-between-the-sheets sexy times were off the charts hot!

I am so glad I gave Disorderly Conduct another chance, otherwise I'd have missed out on a fantastic read! I can't wait to pick up Indecent Exposure to read all about Jack!",1516320000,4
5912,121,1756,"Truly Devious is a uniquely written mystery novel in that there is no mystery being solved as much as it being uncovered at the end. The main character of the novel, Stevie is an aspiring detective - she comes to Ellingham, an elite school for prodigies, because she wants to solve a cold case involving the schools founders family. The story takes place in both times - the present where Stevie is going through the case and the newer murder that happens, and in the past, telling us the events leading to and right after the abduction and murder of the founders wife and daughter, and a student of the school.

The atmosphere of the book is quite rich - it is an isolated boarding school, there is a small pool of students, there are creepy forests and lake craters and secret tunnels. But unlike a regular novel, it doesnt focus on the mystery; it is about the people that surround the mystery. Stevies development is not to look at just the mystery like a puzzle, but look at it from an emotional perspective, too. For the most part of the book, it eschews traditional mystery tropes - there are barely any clues being uncovered, and as a reader, we are not solving the mystery. It felt a bit frustrating at times, not being the one uncovering the mystery along with Stevie, nor being intimate with what she is deducing from it. She also doesnt look at a crime scene and catalogue what was unusual or anything - in fact, it plays out more like she is trying hard to be detective. But even so, she manages to solve the present murder of one of her classmates.

On a character perspective, Stevie provides mental health representation - she has anxiety and has had panic attacks. There are her housemates, who are big mysteries in themselves. Theres the web series star who seems shady and gets murdered. The artist who has no filter, and no awareness of social constraints. The aloof writer who she befriends, and the builder who is her best friend there. Theres the coding prodigy, who for some reason, likes to insert himself into her life. All of their interpersonal relationships are as much a part of the story as the bigger mystery of whodunnit. For a pack of mostly outcasts, they don't exactly band together either.

Overall, it is intriguing, different and certainly has you wanting for more (it ended in a cliffhanger!) so this one is recommended for mystery lovers.

But, I haven't read many of the Cajun stories because I have to be in the right mood for some of her brand of silliness. It has been YEARS since I have lived in Louisiana, but this book took me right back to their culture. A lot of spot-on things to remind me of my time there. If you are unfamiliar with the Cajun way of speaking, I can see how reading it may get on your nerves. Much of the book made me smile, but I didn't feel the romance between Adam and Simone. There was so much going on with all the other supporting cast that I never felt satisfied with the main couple's relationship unfolding properly.

During a beheading, Clancy mentions how reverent the crowd comports themselves. I experienced a beheading in the main square of Riyad in 1977, and instead of reverence, the crowd was more into participation. These are just minor details in a long, long book.  It didn't help that the only character I liked was Ryan's wife.  I was ready to sacrifice her if only all the rest would be incinerated in a horrible holocaust.

5916,919,205,"Where do I start with Dracula? I didn't hate it so there's that. It was weird. I mean I expect classics to be weird for the most part since times are so different now but it's like bonus weird. I will still always love all retellings and movies about the Drac. I listened to the audiobook and followed along in my library book. Classics end up on audio most of the time for me.

There are darknesses in life and there are lights, and you are one of the lights, the light of all lights.

So much could have been avoided if Harker would have listened to those people when they said not to go. If so many people are telling you it's a bad idea, it's probably a bad idea. But then there's the double edge sword, would Dracula have been stopped if Harker didn't go?

Remember my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker

The biggest problem I had was all of the voices. I can appreciate different POVs, it can be a really good way to get the whole story. However, having 8 main different voices plus a handful of others is too many for me. It's also written entirely in diary/journal entries, newspaper articles, and letters. This gives the complete story since we get perspective from everyone but it also is too much. I mean why does he write down so much detail in his diary? Is what he had for dinner and going to the bathroom that important? I think those are things the story doesn't actually need. Did people back in the day actually keep such detailed diaries? I feel like these people just walk around all day writing down every single thing they do. The audiobook really helped me get through all the POV changes.

I want you to believe...to believe in things that you cannot.

There were a few things I really didn't expect. Apparently, Dracula is related to Attila the Hun. I thought that was cool. Everything I thought of in regards to vampires and werewolves is in question here... vampires are usually bats and werewolves are wolves obviously, they don't normally like each other and there are usually exclusive. Very rarely is there a vampire-werewolf hybrid( Underworld is the only thing I can think of where that is and Vampire Diaries) but Dracula is both? He can control the wolves and turn into a bat or wolf. I've always pictured Dracula as strictly vamp.

Overall, I liked Dracula. He is the father of most vampire fiction and in this way, he was successful in spreading the undead curse.",1516320000,3

But that is my only quibble with Ursula Le Guin.  Its rightfully acknowledged as one of the genre's classics and many think its a classic of general fiction.
The book jacket summarizes the story well.  This Ursula Le Guin novel is a tale of a utopian society,  and the characters that struggle to keep it a utopia. It is a multi-layered novel.

What it's all about...

Blood! This book is about people who have to sell their blood in order to live! Its complicated and when I first began this book I wasn't sure that I would be able to read it. It revolves around a Queen and a family and the Queens quest to live forever...no matter the cost. But...of course...nothing is what it seems in a book like this. Jules...the poorest of anyone...is the key to everything! Secrets abound, childhood memories are key and Jules has to be the one to figure it all out.

Why I wanted to read it...

I was in the mood for a fantasy. The cover of this book is beautiful. The writing is strong and captivating.

What made me truly enjoy this book...

The plot is unique. The pace is fast. I sped through the last few pages. I had to know what Jules...brave Jules...would do. Where would she go to hide from evil? Is there anywhere safe? Whom can she trust? I have to wait for the next book for answers!
.
Why you should read it, too...

Readers who love a unique fantasy should love this book!

I received this book from the publisher and NetGalley and Amazon.  I read and reviewed this book because I wanted to.",1516320000,5
5934,764,819,"The Woman in the Window was an extremely good page-turner, a good beach read and a nice little thriller.  The beginning is a little slow, the writing isn't War and Peace, the plot isn't even original, but it was great fun to read and I was taken by surprise at the various twists.  I wish A.J. Finn great success with his future novels.",1516320000,5
5935,455,1415,"The first book I read by Deborah Crombie was the 14th in her Gemma James/Duncan Kincaid mystery series No Mark Upon Her. When a female rower, who happened to be a Met detective, drowns under mysterious circumstances, Scotland Yard detectives James and Kincaid are on the case.

I was immediately drawn into the story, thanks mostly to the interesting characters. Gemma and Duncan are work and life partners, and we get to know the other detectives, Melody and Doug, who assist them. The central London area where the action takes place is also an intriguing character.

Crombie's 17th book in the series, The Garden of Lamentations, begins a few years later. Although I have missed a few books in between, I was able to pick up without missing too much.

A young nanny is found dead in a walled off garden area, accessible only by the people who live adjacent to it. Gemma is drawn into the investigation by a friend of hers who lives near there.

Meanwhile, when an undercover cop is found dead, a suspected suicide, Kincaid is contacted by his former boss, whom he hasn't talked to since the boss abruptly transferred Kincaid. After Kincaid meets with his boss in a restaurant, the boss is attacked and left for dead.

Kincaid becomes obsessed with the attack and the possible connection to the undercover cop's death. Was it really suicide or is it something more sinister? Are cops being targeted and is he next?

In this story, everyone seems to be split up and pulled apart. Melody takes over Gemma's responsibilities while Gemma is pulled into the dead nanny's murder. Doug is no longer working with Kincaid. Kincaid's preoccupation with his case has kept him away from his and Gemma's children- teenage Kit, seven-year-old Toby and three year-old Charlotte. Gemma is upset that he is not confiding in her.

It took me awhile to get into The Garden of Lamentations, but once I did, I couldn't stop reading until I was done. The neighborhood where the nanny was killed is filled with many interesting Agatha Christie-like characters- the parents who lost a young son last year and blamed the dead nanny, a busybody woman obsessed with the garden, the nanny's highstrung boss and her son who wants to be a ballet dancer- that took a bit to keep straight.

Kincaid's investigation leads him back to the case from No Mark Upon Her, as well as to an incident from 1994 involving an undercover police operation infiltrating possible terrorist organizations. There is alot to keep track of here, but Crombie keeps her eye on the ball and everything comes together in the end.

I liked that there are so many female police officers in the story. Gemma, Melody, Gemma's new partner in the nanny investigation is a woman, and later in the story we meet a high ranking woman in Scotland Yard. It's no big deal here, the way it should be.

Fans of Irish mystery writer Tana French (The Dublin Murder Squad series) will like Deborah Crombie's The Garden of Lamentations. They both write taut, character-driven mysteries that immerse the reader in the location of the story. I highly recommend The Garden of Lamentations, although I will say that this perhaps is not a good book to jump into the series with. People who have read previous books in the series will get much more out of it.",1516320000,4

Forming a wary truce, the surviving sisters look to the past to find the truth, unearthing the secrets that destroyed their family all those years ago . . . and uncovering the possibility of redemption, and revenge, where they least expect it.""

My Thoughts:

This book was by far the darkest and most thrilling book that I finished in 2017!  It was so very intense and a complete page turner!  I picked this book up finally thanks my personal TBR challenge - it's the first book that I've read off of my list of TBR reads.  It was so unbelievably good and I'm kicking myself for waiting until now to read it!  I've now read three books by Slaughter and she has jumped on to my must read everything she writes list!  She definitely writes books that are on the darker side so they won't be for everyone.  They are my kind of books though as I couldn't get enough of this one!  I found myself completely immersed in this book from the very beginning.  The thing about reading it was that you just never knew what was going to happen next.  The author had me twisting and turning right along with the characters - I just couldn't stop reading because of it!  I found myself so immersed in this book trying to figure out what was going on!  And how it was all going to end - I just didn't want to stop reading.  I'm trying not to go into too much detail as I don't want to give anything away.  This is a book that you just need to read and experience for yourself!  The book begins when Claire's husband is killed which in itself is a pretty intense moment and literally doesn't stop from there.  I'm just basically gushing at this point but it was just that good!

Overall, this book easily ended up on my top reads list for 2017 as I absolutely loved it!  Not sure exactly what that says about me considering the subject matter and how dark the book was but there you have it.  This is one of those thrillers that I won't be forgetting about any time soon.  It was intense and heart pounding but just oh so good!  I'm really glad that this challenge finally helped me to pull this one off of my TBR list.  It's been on there since August of 2015 according to Goodreads.  Yikes!  I would recommend this one to fans of thrillers and mysteries a like.  Just be warned that there is some difficult subject matter and that this is an author not afraid to pull punches with her main characters.  Highly recommended!

Bottom Line:  Heart-stoppingly good!

This book was well written and well developed, and has an interesting story that makes the reader want to keep reading.

This is a historical fiction book about the people of Lithuania being taken from their homes by a secret Russian police force known as the NKVD. There is a part of the story where the people of Lithuania have been taken and there is a mother with her newborn baby on the bus and the NKVD take the baby from the mother. This shows the levels of intensity and conflict in the book. The story follows the life of Lina Vilkas and her familys life while all of this is happening. Throughout the story Lina is searching for her dad who was taken before Lina and her family were. Once all of the people who lived in Lithuania had been taken, they were brought to a camp where they will be living which serves a greater purpose other than to hold the people until the NKVD gets what they want. This book connects to Ruta Sepetys because she is a Lithuanian-American writer who has written other historical fiction books similar to Between Shades of Gray.

This was a very entertaining book to read because it didn't take a long time to develop like some other books seem to do at times. The book contains all elements that readers can find enjoyable in a book such as: action, conflict, suspense, and emotion. Between Shades of Gray contains all of these elements while being a well written and well developed book. I definitely recommend this book for all people looking for a good read.

...by Clay...

This novel is about the innocent people of Lithuania being taken from their homes by the NKVD. This book is an extravagant book that keeps the reader involved throughout and never has a dull moment.

 Lina is just a normal girl living in the 1940s just like any other person now. Until things take a turn for the worst for her and her family. For Lina, it is a normal, brisk, night in the land of Lithuania, when she hears loud banging on the door. She panics, however, her mom does not. She tells Lina to not worry and to go to her room and Lina obeys. A few minutes later Lina hears loud crashing noises coming from the downstairs. She rushes downstairs to find things all over the place and it looked like an earthquake had hit. There are trends just like this historical fiction book. Such as many books about World War II. Also many books about people who become enslaved in stuff they cannot control.

 Ruta Sepetys really did a great job on this historical fiction novel that never seemed to keep the reader bored. Anything historical that compels you to read it, then you will definitely have to read this too.",1516320000,4
5942,604,1471,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the first Bond novel having watched the majority of the films. Casino Royale began a bit slow and at first it felt as if the reader needed further background about post-WWII Europe, however, about 40 pages in that all changed. The pace of the book picked up and the characters came to life. The reader learns about Bonds idiosyncrasies as the action and adventure picks up. The book is a fairly quick read but is also a jam packed story. It is the perfect length for what it conveys. Not to mention, the ending was A++. Definitely read this if you haven't read any Bond novels, and as it is the first one, its the perfect place to start.",1516320000,4

Without religious faith the nation of Israel will not survive and is a meaningless existence and cultural experiment. But of that the author cannot speak. To understand he must first must gain faith in that God created Israel and the Jews. The perspective must be from God's point of view, not from the Jewish ever changing culture, preferences and circumstances. Israel and the Jews exists because God wants it, not the other way around.

5946,712,6,"Despite being a voracious reader, there are some books considered ""children's classics"" that I have never read.  I decided to rectify this recently by picking up ""The Secret Garden.""  I was somewhat familiar with the story, as I'd watched a film adaptation of the story at one point, but am fully aware that books and their movies can often be vastly different.  So though I could predict certain things about the story as I read, I still found it an enjoyable read... even if it isn't my favorite book, and certain elements felt strange in their inclusion, especially towards the end.

""The Secret Garden"" follows Mary, a spoiled and unlikable young girl and the daughter of a British officer living in India.  When her parents die of a terrible sickness, she's shuttled off to England to live with a reclusive uncle, and finds herself lost and alone in the gloomy manor.  But as she sets out to explore her new home and make sense of this strange new land, she discovers the titular secret garden -- a garden that has been locked up since her aunt died in a tragic accident ten years ago.  Enchanted by the garden, Mary sets out to tend it and bring it back to life, aided by a grouchy gardener, a soft-hearted animal-loving boy named Dickon... and Colin, a cousin who has been locked inside all his life and treated like an invalid.  The garden turns out to be just the thing both Mary and Colin need to revitalize themselves... and it just may finally bring healing to a family long broken by tragedy...

""The Secret Garden"" is an enchanting novel, told with an almost fairy-tale-like language that evokes the sights, sounds, and smells of the English moors and gardens and their inhabitants.  The writing style is lovely, and paints clear pictures in the mind.  The heavy Yorkshire accents of certain characters can be tricky at times, but I managed anyhow.  And while Dickon as a character feels a little too good to be true, almost straying into Mary-Sue territory, it's nice to see Mary and Colin develop as the book goes in, gaining confidence in themselves and shedding some of the selfishness and bad temper their sheltered lives have given them.

The biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that the book strays into a weird fantasy/magical-realism realm toward the end, which I feel wasn't foreshadowed very well.  I love fantasy and don't mind magical realism, but it felt out of place here, especially with Colin going on about studying ""magic"" while at the same time declaring he wants to be a scientist.  It just felt odd to me, and while it might be a product of its time (this book IS over a century old), it did taint my enjoyment somewhat.

Still, complaints aside, I can easily see why ""The Secret Garden"" enjoys a reputation as a children's classic.  It's not the best children's novel I've ever read, but I enjoyed it, and am glad I gave it a chance.  Perhaps I'll pick up the author's other classic, ""A Little Princess,"" sometime in the near future...",1516406400,4
5947,9,1769,"Not my kind of book.  I agree with another reviewer that compared it to a bit ""watered down harlequin romance"".  The thick Irish accents throughout slowed the reading down, and I just couldn't read the abuse the children received at work and school.  I'm sure, though, that these things did occur at the time of the potato famine and with that in mind it was probably realistic.  I just don't think I'm going to continue with the series.",1516406400,3
5948,547,1697,This book was sooo good! I hated putting it down! The storyline is unique and draws you in. Plus the twists and turns make your head spin. My only complaint is that the sequel isn't out yet so I can find out what happens!,1516406400,5
5949,322,592,"Meh.  Unlike most of the people who read this book, I found it a bit disappointing.  (If you loved it, I wish I had read it through your eyes, and if you want to read it, you may want to read the majority of the very good reviews instead of this one.)

I loved the premise.  Something has appeared in the world that drives humans insane  causing them to kill themselves and possibly others along the way.  The only way to survive is by keeping your eyes closed at all times if there is any possibility of seeing this ?creature.  (If youve completely boarded up your house, for example, you can open your eyes in your house.)  Okay!  Interesting zombie-ish idea.

The story is essentially about a woman with two four-year-old children trying to take a day-long (perhaps only hours-long?) trip to get from where she is living alone with the children to a place of safety.  The trick?  They have to take a boat on a river blindfolded!  Sounds good!

Unfortunately, the plot just didn't play out for me.  I wasn't given any information about what was causing people to go crazy.  There really wasn't much that happened.  And much that did happen wasn't particularly horrifying.  For a book playing a lot on what might be lurking in the shadows (or, in this case, behind the blindfold), I expected more shivery moments.  Please don't misunderstand:  Im not complaining because I wanted more gore  I cant handle gore.  Im merely saying that for a novel that is supposed to deliver psychological horror, I just didn't feel it.

Also, Im a person who loves character-driven novels.  Even though we spend all of our time in the head and memories of Malorie, I just didn't connect with her.  I really didn't get a good idea of who she was, whether Id like to be a friend of hers, or what her interests and capabilities were.  Considering Malorie is the only viewpoint character, this took away from the book for me.

In truth, I felt the author spent a lot of time trying to raise goose bumps on my arms with a Just imagine if you couldn't open your eyes and you didn't know what was happening around you  just imagine if you touched or heard something you weren't expecting  wouldnt that be really scary???  Well, yes, it would.  For the length of a short story.  Or perhaps a novella.  Not for a 300-page novel that seems to rely solely on this one device.  There was just too much (for me) of What could that noise have been?  Oh no, lets let our imagination run for a while Phew, we got lucky that time, everythings okay  Wait!  What could THAT noise have been?

To give the novel its due, I was compelled to finish it.  I did want to know why Malorie was alone with two young children, and where she was trying to get to.  I did want to know what would happen when she got there, if she got there.  And another plus:  I should have seen the ending coming, and didnt",1516406400,3

5951,638,1413,"Rating 4.5/5 Stars

Rating: 4.5/5 Stars

""Wow"" is about the only word I can think to give this story. It quite literally took my breath away at the very end. Attempting to summarize and review this novel is quite a task not simply because of the heavy and heartbreaking subject matter, but because of the magnificent, intricate, and beautifully written story that Jodi Picoult told that brought a face to the victims of the Holocaust and even a heart to some of the perpetrators.

The StoryTeller primarily follows four main characters, and through the story, we see from their point of view, two of which are present tense (Sage and Leo), two of which are in the past (Josef and Minka).

Sage Singer has spent the past three years frequenting a grief support group, trying to deal with the loss of her mother to the same car accident that gave her a disfiguring scar across her face. Dealing with the loss and insecure about her scar, she hides herself away as a baker, working through the night to prepare breads and pastries for her friend's bakery, finding therapy in the process.

But her life suddenly changes when she befriends Josef Weber, a member of her grief group and frequent patron of the bakery. They spark an unlikely friendship, bonding over grief. However, one night Josef reveals a disturbimg secret: he was a Nazi during WWII and is responsible for the death of countless people and heinous other crimes. And now, he is wanting forgivenes.....and to die,and wants Sage to help him. Over their next few meetings, Josef recounts in detail his time as Hitler Youth and an SS officer, and the horrific crimes be committed.

Disgusted and horrified by this revelation, Sage contacts the FBI where she meets Leo who still needs more information before he can proceed with any type of action against Josef. Sage then takes him to the only person she can think of: her grandmother, who is a Holocaust Survivor.

From there we are taken on a heartbreaking journey filled with excruciating details of loss, pain, suffering, hatred and forgiveness as Minka, Sage's grandmother, recounts her experience during the war and with it, helps to guide Sage as she wrestles with what she should do.

This novel is absolutely intense, but beautifully written and impeccably researched. Picoult brings to life the times in which we are reading, making us want to run home and hug our loved ones. Even so, it also manages to take us into morally gray areas where we wonder what is truly right or wrong and if we should forgive those who truly seek penance for their crimes.

Though I loved this story immensly, I was a bit put off by the length. It has always been my opinion that to tell a truly intense tale, you should do so in a way that is both detailed yet succinct. Minka's story took up about half of the book (which was 460 pages) and though I understood the need for this, as we needed to fully be able to immerse ourselves in the horror of her experience and truly appreciate her as a character, after a certain point, it seemed to outlast it's purpose. It went on for so long, I actually stopped empathizing and caring. This actually affected my enjoyment of it so much, I was tempted to downgrade my rating one full star; however, the last 60 pages really cemented the how amzing this book is, especially when you realized the completely unexpected (for me) twist at the end. A surprise I did not see coming. One I didnot  even know to anticipate. It ended the story on such a bittersweet note, one that left me so heartbroken for many reasons and I just cannot say enough about it.

If you are a fan of Picoult's other stories. If you love historical/WWII fiction. If you just love a great and impactful story...you need this book.",1516406400,4
5952,878,132,"Four stars because it's good but not great. I liked the 1915 story better than the 1947 one.

5953,233,96,"4 out of 5 stars to HIDDEN FIGURES

This book was a bit of a slow start for me because its written like a history/math textbook rather than a novel or a memoir, which is what I find easier to read in nonfiction. However, it's amazingly chock-full of incredible information and worth all the time it takes to read.

HIDDEN FIGURES is the story behind the black women who helped launch a man to the moon. Right? I didn't know this story existed until this book, which makes it extra important. I loved these women's stories and their passion, determination, and love for something that honestly terrifies me (math!)

It was also great because while Ive had a mental understanding of the racism of the early 1900s, this book really crystallized it for me and made it personal and real. I now have a heart-understanding, not just a head-understanding. And it was horrible. Blatant and disgusting and treacherous.

Overall, I would have given this book 5 stars because I love the story and what it shows me about America, but I did have bit of a hard time getting into it because of the emphasis on historical facts of personal story.

There is nary a word that's left unsaid about WH's characters. These understated giants are portrayed with many nuances, which allows them to be viewed in a different light by people of different eras or cultures. The author herself may have had clear heroes and villains when she set out to write the book, but almost all her characters could be interpreted in different lights depending on the reader's values, morals, tastes and background.

The book was certainly well ahead of its time. Its influence on the literature of the next few decades must have been highly significant, not just because of the styles, themes or stories here, but also because of the richness of the language.  The author's age and unique background, including the gender, makes everything that much more extraordinary. For a modern reader, the book has two major flaws. The one is borne out of the book's own success: the story contains little twists given how many times any reader must have been told a similar story - directly or indirectly inspired from the book - somewhere else. The second issue is because of the era that was. To readers who are not at ease with what was counted right and what not in the mid-1800s in English aristocratic societies, there is a lot in the book which is revoltingly classist/feudal and patriarchal.",1516406400,4

But after a mention that this classic was actually quite entertaining, I decided to finally pick it up. And they were right, because I actually found myself having a lot of fun while readingThe Invisible Man. Not only is the prose quite easy to read, but the plot itself is both intriguing and entertaining as things start escalating. The character development has been really well done and shows the effects being invisible can have on a man... If you are looking for an accessible and entertaining classic to read,The Invisible Man is the choice for you.",1516406400,4
5962,666,1165,"CW: Drug abuse, mention of rape

This book was one of the gifts I got for my birthday from my fianc back in October and I am so happy I decided to pick it up now. I had seen the cover around other blogs, videos, and on social media but I didn't know much about it other than it was some sort of Sherlock Holmes retelling.

I love the fact that it wasn't so much as a retelling, as a companion series 100 years after the famous stories in The Adventures in Sherlock  Holmes. I loved the idea of our main characters being the descendants of Holmes and Watson. I will admit I thought it was going to be a bit cheesy, kind of like the Descendants books/movies (which isn't any shade towards them! I find them fun, but they're definitely a bit cheesy at times). But it wasn't, instead it was kind of exactly what I wanted out of a story with a premise like the one above.

First, the characters. I genuinely loved Jamie Watson and Charlotte Holmes. I have a soft spot for John Watson, so I loved Jamie a little bit more but just like Sherlock, Charlotte was as charming as she was intelligent. I loved their friendship, the way they bickered and debated but held a underlining tone of respect and love for each other. I would easily pick up the other books just on the fact that I want more of their interactions, and that isn't taking the well written mystery.

The mystery was a lot of fun, and definitely gives off a Sherlock Holmes vibe. Because Charlotte is so young, even with all the detective training she has been given she's also just a teenager who has had a very interesting childhood and is going through some pretty adult things. I thought it felt realistic and I think because I was expecting for the story to be cheesy, I was just shocked at how mature the story was but especially Charlotte's story. Jamie's character was great because I loved being in his head. I like that he was smart, smarter than he gave himself credit for, but he was also well loved. Like I said earlier,  I have a huge soft spot for John Watson, so I think Jamie fit under that soft spot also. It is mentioned he's on the rugby team to help his aggression, but I would have liked to see more of that with him. We see Charlotte dealing with her abuse of drugs, so it would be nice to see Jamie struggling with his anger. Maybe it'll come up in later books, or maybe him focusing so hard on solving mysteries with Charlotte helped.

The writing was really well done. I think it was a great young adult companion to the original stories. The story is fast paced and kind of drops you into the story right away, which sometimes can be jarring in other experiences but I didn't find it to be in this case. I thought it was easy to get into the story and keep up with the pace. There was only one thing I honestly had a bit of a problem with and that had to do with Charlotte's drug use. We are told her family put her in rehab a handful of times but she still continues to use drugs. I understand that is a parallel to her great-great-great-granddaughter and there is a message of ""don't do drugs kids"" but I don't feel like anyone other than Jamie is really concerned about her drug abuse. Maybe that's a comment on boarding/private schools and caring more about their student's public reputation, but I feel like it was a bit odd that Charlotte didn't have many repercussions in the present story.

Overall, I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you like The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle, if you like the Sherlock Holmes movies or even the Sherlock BBC show, then I think you'll like this. If you aren't experienced in the Sherlock Holmes world, I think this could be a fun introduction. Either way, I say pick it up and try it because I think it's worth it!",1516492800,4
5963,877,1770,"Loved it.  Very interesting memoir and excellent, in-depth writing.  I'm reminded of Malcolm Gladwell's book, David & Goliath.  The adversity Mary Pflum experienced in her family is what made her the great person, tv producer, mother and writer she is today.  The book also brought back lots of memories of being raised in the Catholic Church.  First Communion, Confirmation, going to confession, catechism, mass, the rosary, prayer cards, etc.  My mother was not a hoarder but she was not a good housekeeper.  Our house was cluttered and just dirty.  I had many years of shame over that house but it was nothing compared to Mary's childhood home.  As they say, ""All things in life are relative.""

5964,1068,1697,"The entire YA fantasy genre is filled with either female protagonists with magic they don't know about or magic they develop. I am trying desperately to steer clear of these tropes, but....this cover though. <3

I wanted to love this book. I wanted to love Jules and her father as they slog through a world run with time as their currency. It's a cool concept and world, but had me confused for about half of the book. I hate when I feel as though books remind me of other books (before you say it, I know there are NO original ideas anymore, but at least when a plot is similar, the characters and situations differ), but sadly this one crushed Red Queen with some Ember in the Ashes and a few others and I couldn't get past it.

That is not to say I didn't enjoy reading it. I did. The writing was good except for some info dumps and confusing backstories. Jules was sort of dry and I admit that I do enjoy romance, but this one was lacking in that department.

Here's the break down: Jules goes to work at Everless to pay off her father's debts despite his warnings to stay away from the palace AND the queen both. She ignores all warnings which pissed me off. She came off like such a smart gal with a head on her shoulders, but she put herself into some stupid situations for reasons that were not even justified. Thus is the YA fantasy i suppose.

I feel like there was potential that was missed, characters that could have developed a little better and plot-lines that could have been scratched. I hope others enjoy it more than I did.

5965,879,958,"I think my heart stopped a few times while reading this book. I consumed it in less than a day, because I honestly was drawn to the lives of Joaquin, Grace and Maya.

They each tell the story in alternating chapters, yet it flows together so smoothly, the concept of them being family seems right from the very beginning.

Each sibling is dealing with confronting how their past (both mistakes they've made and the fact that they were given up by their biological mother) meshes with their future that each isn't sure they deserve.

Grace's pain really rocked me to my core. I felt a heavy pit in my chest as I read her chapters and I found myself desperate to find some solace for her...however she didn't outshine Joaquin and Maya by much.

With dynamic characters, stunning and subtle plot twists, lovely supporting characters (Rafe!, Mark and Linda ), this is a masterpiece deserving of all the press and awards it's received.

5988,601,14,"When Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner first published Freakonomocs in 2005 it was widely promoted as breakthrough thinking and an important challenge to the common wisdom. I am not sure why I held off reading it because I was much impressed by the press and the interviews. Now, almost 13 years later it seems stale and hardly breakthrough.

Since then there have been a number of other books based on the advantages of thinking from different perspectives and going beyond the common wisdom. It now seems that the very expression common wisdom is the kiss of death on any idea. We have all become so expert on everything that too many feel empowered to challenge as equals anyone who has actually studied and earned the right to publish on even the most esoteric topics.

One major thing not addressed by the authors is the terrible way much of the product of science tends to be consumed. Two examples. Often opinions about research are based on second hand analysis of the paper under discussion. Hear this analysis from within our respective our respective echo champers, means starting from a position of bias, driven by the slant of the preferred media outlet. That the speaker has mis-read, or selectively read the paper has to be part of an individuals analysis. Or better yet, read the paper in its original.
What is most infuriating to me is the confusion over what is meant when a paper concludes that something tends to cause something else. If you know of one or fifty examples counter to the paper the paper is NOT necessarily wrong. What the author(s) proved was that within their data set the this causes that - is likely true is for some statistically significant percentage of the total occurrences of that. Your counter examples may prove that the paper is wrong or just that you are more aware of the Thats not related to a particular causative This.

Back to the book. Much of what the authors have to say about crime was of particular interest to me. I am employed to provide support to some of the new creative policing strategies that grew out of NYPDs COMSTAT Process. He never directly criticizes the approach but it can be oversold.
The claim that is most famously made that readily available abortion has contributed to a fifteen year plus reduction, nationwide, in crime. I do not hear this claim given any discussion within the profession. Yet there is no agreement within the profession as to what does explain the decline. Not having any agreement on this side of the trend leaves us all exposed when this trend, like others makes its turn around.
What I came to dislike was the short intros to each new chapter. All those paragraphs about how great and unique is Stephen Levitt. It all tends to read like so much P.R. If the man needs so much sell, why?

The Section subtitled: Would a Roshanda by any Other Name Smell as Sweet? Brings us to the limits of Levitts approach. Early in the section he tells us of a number of studies that people with the same resume content and names that signal different ethic/racial backgrounds get different rates of acceptance into job interviews and Colleges. These are discounted because (1) they do not tell us if the bias was race based or based on the association with these names and economic/social conditions. The person seeking school entrance or a job, this is a distinction without a difference. Whatever the probabilities of a successful interview is in fact known. No interview means no job. The non-interview is a 100% certainty, the other merely an imponderable probability.
Later there is a brief mention of studies that show lower long term outcomes for the people with the wrong names. Again why is less important than the fact these studies tend to reinforce the decisions made by the schools and employers. For the record, this reinforcement not based on the individual achievements of the individuals applicant. It is the association tied to the name.

We may have needed Freakonomics in 2005. What we need in 2018 is reinforcement that facts do exist and take primacy over opinion.",1516492800,2

It just did not hold up to my other reads, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more at a different time.  Overall, it was a cute read.

5991,2,598,"NBC News correspondent Katy Tur reported on Donald Trump's presidential campaign right from the start, often finding herself publicly singled out by the candidate with alternating praise and insults in his signature volatile style. Trump broke political and societal norms left and right, and in this book, Tur somewhat breathlessly recounts what it was like for a reporter to follow that story across the country, watching the Republican's support grow in rally after rally -- and through scandal after scandal -- on the way to his unlikely electoral victory.

To some extent, the resulting book is less interesting because of the very outcome it depicts. The author is completely correct that there has never been a presidential candidate like Trump, but after a year of seeing him govern in the same chaotic way that he ran for office, there's not really much novelty in looking back on the election beyond the occasional jolting reminder that we used to find such behavior unusual. Tur's insights into Trump's success are also pretty surface-level, although her descriptions of the sexism and other ugliness on display at his rallies are chilling, especially for the verbal and physical threats directed at the author and her fellow journalists. In the end, though, it's sadly all too believable.",1516492800,2

Instead of flying cars, we get 140 characters, and people no longer have an optimistic view of technology's ability to change the world. The best minds are thinking about how to make people click ads, or to make instantaneous stock market trades.

When fresh out of college, Musk founded Zip2, a primitive Google Maps meets Yelp. Compaq bought Zip2 in 1999 for $307 million. Musk made $22 million from the deal and poured almost all of it into becoming the largest shareholder in a startup that would morph into PayPal - a company eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Moving from Silicon Valley to L.A., he put $70 million into Tesla, $100 million into SpaceX, and $10 million into SolarCity. SpaceX has made a name for itself as the low-cost supplier while battling Lockheed Martin and Boeing, as well as Russia and China. It's key - reusable rockets. With Tesla, Musk has tried to revamp how cars are manufactured and sold, while building a worldwide fuel distribution network at the same time. Viewing hybrids as a suboptimal comprises, Tesla strives to make all-electric cars that people lust after and that push the limits of technology. Teslas are not sold through dealers, but rather on the Web and in galleries located in high-end shopping centers. Tesla also does not anticipate making lots of money from servicing vehicles - electric cars do not require most of the maintenance procedures of most traditional cars. Its solar-powered recharging stations run along many major highways in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, can add hundreds of miles of power to a car in about 20 minutes, and cost nothing to Tesla owners. With Solar City, Musk has funded the largest installer and financer of solar panels, and the company is run by two of his cousins.

In a typical week, he works all of Monday at SpaceX, Tuesday begins again at SpaceX - then he flies to Silicon Valley to spend a couple of days working at Tesla. Thursdays it's back to L.A. and SpaceX. Four days/week he has custody of his five young boys (twins and triplets).

In 1984, 'PC and Office Technology' published the code for a science-fiction-inspired space game by 12-year-old Elon Musk. Musk immigrated to the U.S. in his 20's.

From a very young age, he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times - ten hours/day was not unusual. He had a photographic memory. His childhood was not generally happy - problems with his engineer father. (Parents divorced.) Great interest in science, math and computers.

5993,666,698,"I have been intimidated by this book for a while now. I bought it when everyone was talking about it years ago close it the book's release date, and then tried reading it. I didn't have the time to really enjoy it the way you're supposed to with books like these, and so I put it down. I brought it to and from my college dorm room and home multiple times, and then in January 2016 it traveled with me to the apartment I live in now. I am so mad it took me this long to finally dive into this story.

This book was amazing. It's a slow paced story with a lot of world (well, circus) building, but honestly I think it was worth it and I wouldn't change it. There were moments during reading I was thinking why is this so slow? Why not make it faster paced? but once I got to the end honestly it all kind of made sense. The ending completely made the slower paced story worth pushing through. My biggest advice for this book is to keep pushing through, even if you're unsure about the story.

The circus and the world Morgenstern has built is absolutely enchanting. The mystery behind the circus and how the competition between Celia and Marco are what kept me turning the pages, despite feeling like it was slow at times. The descriptions of the circus, the performers, the different tents, and just the overall ambiance of the experience at Le Cirque des Rves made me so badly want to experience it with the crowd.

The characters were actually really great and I enjoyed them a lot. However, it felt like the circus was the main character, and everyone else were secondary characters. The two characters I liked the best, Poppet and Widget, I would have liked to see more of, especially with Bailey. I thought Celia and Marco were beautifully characters and I did enjoy their plot a lot. But for me, Poppet and Widget's plot was my favorite to read about. The relationship between Celia and her father was intense, and made me feel really bad for her while also hating him. I also felt sorry for Marco with the man in the gray suit, because although Marco was given a lot of great opportunities, he was isolated. I think their entire story is an amazing one and I really enjoyed their romance. I like that the romance wasn't the main focus but instead the characters and circus were the main focus. For the scenes they have together I found them to have amazing chemistry not only as lovers but as friends but I would have liked more scenes with them together.

The writing is amazing. I think because the writing is so beautiful it was easy to just enjoy what was happening, instead of being annoyed by the pace. Morgenstern is obviously a very talented and poetic writer. Like the synopsis of the book states, her writing is rich and seductive. I have seen people review it as overly descriptive, and although I do think it's more descriptive than the average book I do not think it's a bad thing. I feel like the story and world benefit from how descriptive and rich the writing is. Some disagree, so I think it could be a matter of personal taste, but I lived for the descriptions.

There are not many issues I had with the book, but there are some flaws I think the book holds. One being that the timelines could get a bit confusing. I read before I started the book that you need to pay attention to the time stamps in front of each chapter, so I did. But it could still get confusing. Everything came together in the end, which tends to happen with different time periods in books, but the journey got confusing and sometimes it was frustrating. Another being that although I was promised a fierce competition, there wasn't much of a competition and it wasn't explained as well as I wish it was. Also, I did think that the side characters could have used more ""screen time"" but I think the amount of material we are given gets the job done. My last issue with the book is something that may sound vague to someone who hasn't read the book, but I am not a fan of putting spoilers in. I really enjoyed Celia and Marco's relationship, however I would have liked more scenes with them together. Especially with the ending. It felt like we were supposed to be caught up in this big love story, which I was enjoying but not fully emotionally invested in, and I think I could have been if there were more dialogue/scenes with them together in their relationship.

Overall,  I absolutely loved this book. I thought the characters, world, and writing were beautiful. I can easily find myself re-reading this book again when I am in the mood for something rich and warm. I hope Erin Morgenstern writes more books so I can read them because her writing is so haunting.",1516492800,4

5995,594,819,"The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn had a ton of pre-publication buzz, especially at BookExpo 2017, which is where I first heard about the book. There has also been a big media and review campaign supporting it, basically hyping up the book to be the next big read. Needless to say, because of all the buzz, I had the highest expectations for it. While it was a good read, I have to say that Im a little perplexed about the fervor around the book.

Finns protagonist is Anna Fox, a child psychologist who now suffers from agoraphobia, following a traumatic incident. She hasn't left her home in nearly a year, coping with daily life through a cocktail of numerous prescription medications and countless bottles of Merlot. She has limited interactions with the outside world, such as her tenant, therapist, and delivery drivers. Anna also counsels fellow agoraphobics via an online forum, The Agora.

But when Anna witnesses a disturbing crime through her window, the story takes several twists and turns. She knows what she saw, but no one believes her. Eventually, she starts to question her own sanity as the voices surrounding her continually insist that shes imagining everything that has happened thus far.

This was definitely a suspenseful read. I read most of it within the span of one day. Finns writing style is certainly compelling. However, I figured out three or four of the twists before they were revealed, which surprised me because Im normally not the greatest at guessing twists. Nevertheless, its a good read, but I thought that the story lost a little bit of steam once the big climax happens toward the end.

I can see why a film is in development alreadyI think it will translate well to the screen. Following the trend of adaptations like Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train, The Woman in the Window is another addition in a line of unreliable narrators and female-led thrillers.

Ultimately, Im not convinced that all the hype was warranted. Did I enjoy the book? Definitely. Would I recommend it? Yes. Do I think its THE book of 2018? Doubtful, but its a good read nonetheless.

5997,434,819,"Been done before, right? But The Woman in the Window is well worth a read, with an original spin on a familiar plot. There were definite similarities between this novel and The Girl on the Train and Im sure this book will be compared to that one, but unlike the female characters in TGOTT (who I found to be, weak, selfish, and difficult to relate to) I felt a lot of empathy for Anna and it made sense to me why she was unable to leave her house. The detailed descriptions of Annas surroundings made me feel like her home was my home, and I could see why she felt safe there. As a long time Alfred Hitchcock fan I loved all the references to his movies, and also that the plot of this novel was Rear Window-ish. I felt the plot dragged in places, and the mystery was a tad predictable, but still a well-deserved 4 stars, and a first novel to be proud of.",1516579200,4

5999,1038,468,"This book was phenomenal. I could not put it down. Fast-paced, with a wise-cracking protagonist who makes no apologies for her shortcomings, this is one awesome adventure.

As the summary says, the premise is that Artemis is a settlement on the moon. This book also reminded me of why I can't write scifi - I'm just not smart enough (yes, you can quote me on that). Not only is the story full of adventure, it is also full of knowledge. And not snotty, I-know-more-than-you science facts. Jazz as the protagonist EXPLAINS the science to the reader but in a way that is interesting and necessary and makes good sense.

The other big plus of this novel for me was the diversity of characters within the story. Jazz is Saudi Arabian but has lived on the moon since she was 6. Her dad is devoutly Muslim. The major characters are from a variety of nationalities (from Brazilian to Eastern European to Kenyan). It was really refreshing to read a book that reflects my own worldview.

Definitely put this one on your to-read list.",1516579200,5

6003,1071,1072,"I am perhaps the last person who truly wanted to read this book to finally do it. This was the very first book I ever bought on my Kindle. Several Kindles later, I finally got around to reading it. What threw me over the top was 1) noticing it became a movie while I've got a book that was bought on the strength of a pre-release review, which inspired me to 2) borrow the audiobook from the library and that gave me a deadline. I usually speed up audio at least a little, but this guy sounded like a chipmunk with any speed at all. He also had an annoying way of portraying all women with what I can only describe as a ""stereotypical gay voice."" It was so bad and so slow that I got impatient, pulled out the Kindle & just read the darned book already.

The title is one-hundred percent spot on. Almost all 3oo-some pages take place on Thanksgiving Day at a Cowboy's football home game.

Billy Lynn is a 19 year old kid who ended up in Iraq after a judge gave him a choice. He and Bravo squad -- eight close buddies and their Sargeant ""Fine,"" are now War Heroes after a battle is caught on video and shown on Fox News. They've been brought home to do a two-week ""Victory Tour,"" oh and bury Shroom -- one of their own who was killed in the skirmish. Shroom was Billy Lynn's closest friend, and while he's not physically there, he is ever present in Billy Lynn's mind. While on tour they've picked up Albert, a Hollywood type who has bought the rights to their story and is trying to quickly fashion a big movie ""deal"" before they all go back to Iraq. Oh and the US Army would prefer they didn't mention they're going back.

Billy Lynn comes off at first as a stupid hick, but we learn otherwise. He may lack formal education, but he's been reading over in Iraq, with recommendations from Shroom. He's read many of the books that people who don't sign up for the military pretend to read. His list is basically a ""great American Books"" series. He's simplistic but sharp. He lacks confidence to act impressed by himself though, and he's never sure that what he says is on target. What he has is a clear view on right and wrong, and good insight into the differences between those who fight and those who talk about the fight.

The satire is deep, rich and almost constant. It's well-written with great metaphors and one-liners. There's also a wonderful scene where they're greeted by yet another adoring, rich Friend of George Dubya who is foolish enough to proclaim that he's drilling oil ""for the troops."" Fine loses it in one of the most exquisite tirades I've ever read.

I wondered what Ben Fountain would do with the current climate and all the contradictions involved in today's convoluted ""patriotism;"" kneeling for the anthem, or dreamers who have fought in the US services being deported...

Satire can be emotionally gripping, but this one wasn't. I laughed aloud and nodded agreement with the Bravos frequently. I just wasn't much affected by what I read. A book about the public-military disconnect, performative versus actual patriotism, the rich keeping their kids home while making money off the war machine; a loveable, slightly neurotic, too-smart-to-be-educated main character: this one should have hit my sweet spot, but it missed the mark for me. Nonetheless, I would still recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in the topics I've mentioned.

6004,439,179,"Laura and her sister Mary had lots in common with Little Red Riding Hood. They lived with their family in the middle of the dense woods with wolves as their neighbours, not to mention bears and panthers. It's the first in Laura's series of novels about her life, and kicks off when she's almost five years old. On the surface, it's a simple, heartwarming story about reminiscences of days long ago, but what a lot we can take on board from the pioneering spirit displayed in these stories!

I'll start with Ma's great example of making an effort, right down to finishing touches. She wanted everything to be pretty, to the extent of using grated carrot to dye her churned cream, and snips of red flannel to cast lovely kerosene light patterns. Since there was normally nobody but her husband and small children around to notice, she might have been forgiven for not bothering. You might well ask, 'Why make even more work for yourself?' But Caroline understood the power of small embellishments to boost her sense of well-being. She obviously did nothing just for show. What would be the point? It was self-care, because she knew the mood-boosting impact of small details. Caroline was a truly classy lady whose motto might as well have been, 'We're worth it.' Even on the dreariest winter day, she'd never dream of just letting things go.

Next there's Pa's example of the power of stories and music. If all his daughters ever learned from him was their potential to make life richer and happier, he was a successful Dad. He kept drawing on his good memory, sense of humour and fiddle to keep things bright around the house, and work their magic on everyone else too. What a guy, to take responsibility for the fun times, as well as keeping everyone safe and alive. Laura and Mary saw him go off to work each day, but of course it wasn't the common office job many modern fathers have. Risking his life out hunting was all in a day's work for Charles.

I also love his matter-of-fact attitude about strict time management. I went into this re-read assuming they were free of the deadlines and pressure of our era. But that's not true, they were just different. For example, Pa and Uncle Henry were desperate to get Henry's oats shocked before the pending rain, or it would all be for nought. And when they finished, Charles couldn't hang around and relax with his brother, because he had to make it home to milk his cows on time, or their output would be skimpy. These days we may roll our eyes when we hear some old-timer say that waste is a sin. But in their time and place, it was an indisputable fact. The book starts off with the butchering of a pig. I wouldn't be surprised if the only bits of him left over by the time Pa and Ma finished with him were his teeth :)

There are several examples of fantastic creations that can come out of humble circumstances. The delicious food produced from their own little grey log house wouldn't be out of place in a gourmet deli, including cheese, salted fish and hickory smoked venison. There are really interesting details of the steps involved in each process. (A little calf paid a high price for the rennet needed in cheese making.) It's soon clear that one of Laura's trademarks is describing food so our mouths water, even when it's just simple fare. Grandma's 'hasty pudding' is basically just boiled polenta, and 'Johnny Cake' is humble corn bread. But it's written in such a way that I'm sure they'd be tastier than any 21st century attempts.

However, it's not all charming nostalgia. Even a five-year-old girl can't escape tense undercurrents. The story moves along merrily for about 100 pages, then a sentence hits us from seemingly nowhere.  'Mary's hair was beautifully golden, but Laura's was only a dirt-coloured brown.' That observation is like a plug releasing similar gripes, to the point where Laura loses her temper and slaps Mary. Oh oh, sibling rivalry rears its head, and I can't help thinking of the elderly Laura, dredging into her buried past to write about the 60-year-old friction. It turns out to be not just Mary's hair but her whole attitude, behaviour and position as eldest child that got under Laura's skin.

Envy can be an irrational emotion, because deep down, I'm sure Laura wouldn't even want to be like Mary, whose idea of fun seemed to be stitching samplers and stirring pots. Mary comes across as a bit of a princess in this book; a prim, girly girl with just a hint of superiority. Perhaps she found obedience came easy because she wouldn't dream of all the adventurous, quirky and mischievous things that filled Laura's head. Yet we get the impression Laura might have happily given up her own uniqueness, for the chance to be more like her sister. Maybe readers should take it as a hint to carefully consider what we envy. Would it even be worth it?

Laura wasn't too crazy about Sundays either, and I can sort of understand why. These devout 19th century Christians seemed to make hard work out of their 'no work' rule. The girls didn't have much to fall back on, so no wonder the day dragged. I would've considered making clothes for their paper dolls to be more leisure than work, but nope! It was a punishable offense on that day. Am I the only one who thinks the Ingalls family seemed to err on the side of the Pharisees in this respect? I suppose that since life was one long round of house and maintenance work for Charles and Caroline, making a particular effort to keep the Sabbath Day holy had to take top priority, or it would easily slide into the same old grind as the rest of the week.

You can't read this story without a healthy respect for the Big Woods. The Ingalls family could only tame it to a certain extent, but mostly had to adjust to it. They needed to be familiar with its cycles and patterns to eke out a living. Pa even says, 'A man just has to keep everlasting at it, or the woods'll take back the place.' It's easy to imagine that when they left, that's just what must have happened.

Laura turns out to be an early (and very young) believer in the benefit of mindfulness. Little House in the Big Woods finishes off with one of those epiphanies that the present moment is all we really have. She's lying in her bed while Pa plays the fiddle and Ma sews, and the wise five-year-old thinks, 'This is now. It can never be a long time ago.' But of course it is, and I've clocked up many similar moments in my own life, which I'm sure we all have. What a nice reminder to value the little moments before they slip away.

The quote of the book might be Pa's enthusiasm for modern times. ' Other folks can stick to old fashioned ways if they want to, but I'm all for progress. It's a great age we're living in.' I'd love to know what he and Laura would make of our digital era.

Overall, I loved the re-read, including cameo appearances of long-gone relatives such as 'wild' Uncle George who came back from the army with his bugle, and naughty cousin Charley who had his own 'boy who cried wolf' story. Now bring on the next story in the sequence, Little House on the Prairie, which will be up in February.",1516579200,5

Not only do they have to grow accustomed to each other, they also have to grow accustomed to the new way their parents behave. While things aren't ever going to be the same again, they do find a way to co-exist together.

I have to be honest, I can't say I'm in love with this book. I can't say I hated it though either. It was a very well written book. It definitely highlights some of the struggles of blended families. My only issue with it is that it kept going back and forward in time with no warning whatsoever. I kept having to reread the book just to make sure that I didn't miss something somewhere. After getting the hang of it though, it did become easier.

The narrator definitely did a fantastic job on this book. I tried to actually physically read it before purchasing an audiobook and wasn't getting anywhere at all. I'm glad I decided to plunge and buy the audio version. It was definitely worth the buy with the way this narrator performed.

I fully recommend this book. It's very realistic. It's charming. I feel like the author could go back and write some more things into the novel to add more structure and backbone, but it is a very lovely story nonetheless.",1516579200,4

6008,973,16,"Y'all, I really need to quit reading audiobooks because even when I LOVE them (like I LOVED The Hate U Give written by Angie Thomas and fantastically narrated by the amazing Banhi Turpin in the audiobook version), it takes me forever to finish audiobooks now!

If you've spent any amount of time following popular books in the past year, you've heard the hype about this book and you need to believe the hype!! The novel follows Starr, a black American teenager, who is the sole witness to her friend being wrongfully and fatally shot by a police officer. The rest of the novel traces Starr and her family's navigation of questioning police brutality (whilst having a family member who is a police officer), questioning blackness/whiteness and black identity (Starr goes to a school that is majority white and largely unaware of the shooting because it happened on the ""wrong"" side of town), and undergoing all of this while still being in one's teenage years. About halfway through the book, the story jumps five weeks ahead and then fast forwards another five weeks ahead toward the end of the book around Chapter 21 so the reader ends up seeing how this story plays out and effects everyone at different points.

This book is GREAT on EVERY LEVEL!! How? Angie Thomas is a genius. Each pitch ends up being a home run and presents a nuanced view that will hopefully allow readers to thoughtfully expand their horizons. For readers who don't need their horizons expanded, this read will hopefully be comforting and offer a slice of solidarity.

While listening to the audiobook, my heart skipped a beat several times in fear of what would come next, illustrating the incredibly compelling writing of the author that elicits anxiety during certain scenes. The audiobook experience was further heightened by the talents of the narrator who performed so many distinct voices so well, which is often lacking in the YA audiobooks I've previously listened to.

I won't go too much further into the details of the actual plot because many other book reviewers have done a better job at that than I ever could, but I did want to highlight some of my favorite bits. During the novel, Starr has a conversation with her father about ""The Hate U Give,"" something originally said by Tupac that inspired the title of the novel, where Starr's father outlines oppression, the drug society, and the prison industry in such an accessible, informative way that I want to place this little gem of the book in every person's hands!

The situations that the characters are thrown into throughout the book also model difficult conversations kids might experience in today's world, like having a friend display that they have an all/police lives matter mindset and use police apologist actions and language. While a t(w)een might feel strange about confronting a situation like this with a real life friend, seeing it written about here will likely be helpful.

And my last love note to this great book is that it features one of the best burns I've ever heard when one character says to another that they are ""Harry (Potter) and the Order of the Phoenix angry lately.""

6017,227,1775,"I couldn't even make it through the pilot of Girls (an HBO series which stars Lena Dunham):  I didn't like Dunhams character, and I get the sense she was pretty much playing herself.  Dunham also played Anna Kendricks gal-pal in the slow and barely-watchable film Happy Christmas;  Dunham's character contributed nothing to the film.

Despite these initial negative encounters with Lena Dunham, I tried to read Not That Kind of Girl with an open mind, hoping I'd discover something worthwhile about Lena Dunham after all (I mean, SOMEONE must like her since she got a book contract!)  but nah.  First, the book opens with the statement that she covers up self-hatred with aggressive self-acceptance.  Setting whether that statement even makes sense,  it clearly means that the weird, somewhat eccentric personality which has gotten her noticed by the media ISNT even her authentic artistic self!!  Who she is, instead, is a contrived persona she has decided to pursue aggressively in order to throw people off the scent of her own self-loathing.  Wow.  That is so indescribably wrong and sad:  when her career fizzles out, which I'm pretty sure it will, she won't even know who she is.

The first chapter (Take my Virginity!) was just cringe-y, and the second chapter (on platonic bed-sharing) is weird and not conducive to the building of healthy romantic and/or sexual relationships.  Some of the 18 Unlikely Things Ive Said Flirtatiously might be amusing to immature young people, but overall it came across as someone trying WAY TOO HARD to see relevant, chic, unique, funny, worth reading.

6021,176,126,"We Kansans have a love/hate relationship with the Wizard of Oz. On the one hand, were proud of the fact that L. Frank Baum chose to set the Oz books in our state, a fact that is often played up at tourist sites and the like. (I was surprised to find out that Baum never actually lived in Kansas, considering how frequently he is claimed as an honorary native son.) On the other hand, were tired of all the Dorothy and Toto jokes foisted upon us by out-of-state friends and relatives every time the mention of our state comes up. Like everyone else, Ive seen the 1939 film adaptation, but I had never read any of Baums Oz books before. As a 25-year resident of Kansas with an interest in classic literature, I figured it was about time I got around to reading the original text.

The purpose of reading a book after seeing the film is to determine how the original differs from the adaptation, in hopes that some new buried treasures might be unearthed from the text. The verdict on that score, however, is that there is little new to be found here, as the writers of the movie stuck pretty close to Baums book. The screenwriters obviously edited the story for brevity, as there are a few kingdoms and creatures that were left out of the film. In a couple cases it also seems some plot elements may have been left out because the special effects of the 1930s would not have been able to depict them satisfactorily. The most inventive example of the latter category would be the Hammer-Heads. Dorothy and friends also encounter a few talking forest creatures, such as a mischief of field mice and a stork. In general, however, the novels deleted scenes aren't particularly integral to the main thrust of the story, and the film captures Baums original narrative quite well.

One aspect in which the two versions differ considerably is in the level of violence; the book certainly wins out in that department. In Baums novel, the tin woodmans axe is not just for show. His origin story involves self-dismemberment, and in one scene he beheads an entire pack of wolves. Though in the minds of children these would likely be seen as bloodless decapitations, it is certainly odd to read a childrens book in which the heroine and her fanciful friends are sent on a mission to kill someone, in this case the wicked witch. That assassination plot is played down in the movie, but here the fatal intent on the part of both sides of that battle is much more evident. For that reason, one might want to reconsider reading the book to small children, but I suppose it isn't not any worse than the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm.

The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, originally published in 1900, is the first in a series of 14 novels by Baum. He also wrote Ozian plays, short stories, and a comic strip. Since his death, several other authors have also written books set in the world of Oz. There are those who delve deeply into this fictional universe and consider it on a par with J. R. R. Tolkiens Middle Earth. In the history of fantasy literature it likely occupies an important place as Americas Alice in Wonderland. Having read a lot of science fiction from the 19th century and earlier, however, I didn't find this book particularly groundbreaking. Sure, its imaginative, but other than the film adaptation I cant see why Baums book continues to fascinate readers of fantasy literature after all these years, while so many other aged books of the genre have faded into obscurity. I still feel some Kansan pride towards Baum, but Im unlikely to read any of the sequels.",1516579200,3

The mystery and the Truly Devious letter were fantastically eerie. They were smart, twisted, and well-established. The flashbacks worked so well captivating the unhinged tone and kept me engaged. The Ellingham mystery was probably my favorite part of the story.

I liked Stevie. She was inquisitive and head strong and sure of herself. She was smart, capable, and confident in her abilities and that was great to see.

There are some mentions of diversity that I hope will be explored more in the rest of the series. Janelle, Stevies friend is a lesbian, and Janelles crush/partner Vi, uses they/them prounous. Both have incredibly minor roles, with Vi only being mentioned 3 or 4 times, but I hope to see more from them.

Things I Didnt Like
I feel like a lot of the side characters were just there. I honestly couldn't remember half of them, and I had trouble keeping some of them straight. I would have liked to see them established more, especialy Stevies friend Janelle.

For the first half of the story I loved how the mystery was being handled. Stevie, while passionate about true crime and mysteries, actively worked with police and school authorities giving them pertinent information. It was nice to see that she could continue her own investigation without hindering an official one. Unfortunately that changed after the two-thirds mark and Stevie was determined that she had to solve the crime on her own. I was upset, because the story reverted to every murder mystery ever.

The story felt very much like a part one. It was mostly set up for a larger story and we really don't get any answers. It wasn't really a satisfying ending at all.

While I absolutely loved the first half, I was disappointed by the ending and that brought the story down a bit. I was captivated by the flashbacks to the Truly Devious murders and the Ellingham kidnappings. The interviews, the characters, the mystery and tone were all perfect. Truly Devious is a fun mystery and definitly keeps you guessing.

I received a copy of the book from Katherine Tegen Books via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.",1516665600,3
6029,476,1756,"3.5 stars. This raises more questions than it answers, leaving the answers for future books. I didn't click with any of the characters in this which is crucial for me as a reader if I am going to enjoy a book. I will definitely try book 2 when it comes out to see if that ties some things up and leaves me feeling more satisfied. The ending of this had a nice punch, which is what will get me to try book 2.",1516665600,3
6030,279,1778,"I think there is one thing that sets Jill Shalvis apart from other romance authors. Her heroines believe in themselves. Maybe its because she (Jill Shalvis) has a strong man at her side. Maybe its because she (Jill) brought up three intelligent, spirited and beautiful daughters. Maybe its because she (J. S.) doesnt want her heroines or women, in general, to settle for less than what they deserve. Now, all of these things are probably true, but honestly, Im just guessing. What I can say is that I love that Jill Shalvis is not afraid to give her heroine a backbone. Her heroines acknowledge that they are worthy and show strength when they walk away from someone who isn't willing to go in the whole way. Jill Shalvis always manages to remind me that I deserve happiness and fulfilment.

Now, don't get me wrong, these heroines are not perfect. They definitely have vulnerabilities, doubts and insecurities. What person doesnt? My favourite type of heroine is capable of doing things for herself. My favourite type of heroine uses her talents and abilities to get through life. My favourite type of heroine also doesnt mind someone giving them a hand. My favourite type of heroine also doesnt walk into a burning building by herself because of some misguided belief thatSHE CAN DO IT ALL! (Those bloody heroines drive me up the bloody wall!!) My favourite type of heroine is Kylie.

My favourite type of hero is Joeafter he wakes up to himself. Ill give you a hint about why I love Joe. Hes bossy, HOT, protective, HOT, sexy, HOT and he loves his family while also being HOT. Joe also thinks that hes a bad bet on love. Of course, he just hadnt found his one.

I have never met two people more afraid of throwing a penny into a love fountain. Both Joe and Kylie are scared of love but with the chemistry between them, they cant avoid the love bug for long.

I really enjoyed About that kiss. The Heartbreaker Bay series is my favourite type of comfort read. A love story with engaging characters, an interesting storyline, bossy heroes, quirky heroines and really cute animals. I cant get enough of these stories and Im really hoping that Molly and Lucas might be up next. I think I see a spark between them

6031,556,1778,Loved it!  Another great addition to the Heartbreaker Bay Series. It was so fun watching Kylie and Joe try to deny their feelings and the added element of mystery was great fun. Fingers crossed that Molly and Lucas are up next!,1516665600,5
6032,126,1400,"You, who are on the road must have a code that you can live by.
And so become yourself because the past is just a good bye.
Teach your children well, their father's hell did slowly go by,
And feed them on your dreams, the one they pick's the one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you would cry,
So just look at them and sigh and know they love you.
-- Teach Your Children  lyrics by Graham Nash

August 7

When I tell you that my white name is Cedar Hawk Songmaker and that I am the adopted child of Minneapolis liberals, and that when I went looking for my Ojibwe parents and found that I was born Mary Potts I hid the knowledge, maybe youll understand. Or not. Ill write this anyway, because ever since last week things have changed. Apparently  I mean, nobody knows  our world is running backward. Or forward. Or maybe sideways, in a way as yet ungrasped.

And so, at the age of twenty-six, Cedar begins her journal to her unborn child.

Did I mention that Im four months pregnant?
With you?

Prior to this knowledge, Cedar had no interest in finding her birth parents; it is only now as she faces bringing a new life with her unknown medical background that she is driven to find them, to be prepared. But things have changed in these between-times, in this somewhat pre-apocalyptic period, pregnant women are being rounded up, and the hyper-vigilant government seems to know where you are at all times. Turns out Big Brother, or in this case, Mother has been watching.

Of course, they only want to help you, make sure you deliver a healthy baby and there are so many precautions one should take of course, they feel that you should trust them to know what is best for you, for your unborn child.

Evolution has begun its own revolution, and the earth and its inhabitants are changing.

I know weve come to the end of science. Human beings might be saved by science. It might happen, but I am quite sure even then there will be no true explanation. If evolution has reversed, well never know why, any more than we know why it began. It is like consciousness. We can map the brain and parse out the origins of thoughts, even feelings. We can tell everything about the brain except why it exists. And why it thinks about itself. 

I loved the blending of the mystical, spiritual with Ojibwa customs, sprinkled with a little magical realism, a somewhat dystopian setting, loved this strong female central character, all the other characters she connected with, and the focus on the arrival of one babe yet to be born, as if in some way that babe was destined to save the world.

somewhere outside of the actual human experience of words spoken, words thought, there exists a language or perhaps a pre-language made up of words so unthinkably holy they cannot be said, much less known.

6033,599,1728,"I love the Frieda Klein books, and this is one of the best in the series! It got really suspenseful during the second half, even after the murderer was known.

There will only be one more book in the series, but I hope, even then, we won't have to say goodbye to Frieda and her friends!

6035,505,47,"Billy Pilgram is convinced that he has been given a mission by another planet. He spends all of his time going from one time of his life to another without warning. Most of his mission involves his time of imprisonment in the war.

I wanted to like this book. I just couldn't get into it. It was interesting, but it didn't really take my attention that much. It was a bit repetitive and just not interesting. I know it's a classic and many people adore it. Everybody has different opinions. Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean others will.

I liked the way the narrator did this book. It felt like he was a part of the time era. You can really tell that he put in a lot of work into narrating it. I can't say he's one of my favorite narrators, but he did a pretty good job.

I do recommend this book. It's a good book. It may not rank up there with my top favorites, but it's definitely worth the read. I'm sure that many people will take a lot more from this book than I did.",1516665600,3
6036,317,1225,"How have I never heard of this book before now?!? A gripping psychological read, this story hooked me from the very first line and kept me on the edge of my seat to the last.

Centred around a hospital ward, we get to know Alice who is excellent at her job and really connects and cares about her patients. There is Frank who she believes is suffering from locked-in syndrome, even though her boss disagrees, and the close-knit group of staff who feel like family. But Alice is struggling with her personal life in many ways and at times feels overwhelmed by what she thought her life would be like.

But when young, beautiful Cassie Jensen arrives on her ward in a coma after a hit and run, Alice feels a strong connection to this woman, and as Alice begins to uncover snippets of Cassie's life she feels compelled to find out exactly what happened to this young woman. Frank may hold all the answers if only he could find some way to communicate ...

This thrilling story is told from the point of view of Alice, Frank, and Cassie and moves easily from past to present to give us the whole picture. This is not a high-action, fast-paced novel but rather a tense, creepy, and disturbing tale of love, loss, and betrayal of the highest order.

IF YOU KNEW HER by Emily Elgar is a compelling psychological thriller that really got under my skin and I could easily imagine it on our tv screens as a crime drama - a fantastic story by a new author and I cannot wait for more from Emily Elgar.

6037,21,819,"A.J. Finn's debut, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, is a remarkably assured, compelling white-knuckle, cat-and-mouse psychological thriller. Fans of Shirley Jackson's neurotic heroines and Margaret Millar's explorations of loneliness, isolation and paranoia will rejoice in discovering Dr. Anna Fox, an agoraphobic alcoholic and former child physiatrist. She has not left her four-level Harlem townhouse in nearly a year. She is also the definition of an unreliable narrator as she self-medicates with copious amounts of anxiety and depression prescription pills, usually taken with a glass--or entire bottle--of merlot.

Separated from her husband and daughter, Anna's days and nights are filled with watching her favorite noir movies, playing online chess and ministering to people in her online agoraphobia support group. She also watches her neighbors through her telephoto camera lens, like James Stewart in ""Rear Window."" She witnesses one of her neighbors being stabbed to death, but the police find no signs of violence and the neighbors insist no such woman lived there. Is she hallucinating, or has there been a murder?

Chock full of delicious red herrings, jaw-dropping twists and revelations, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is a sinister and clever nail-biter. Anna Fox is a marvelous, complex and engaging heroine. Film noir fans will pick up extra clues as some of Anna's film choices (""Shadow of a Doubt""; ""Midnight Lace"") hint at twists to come. Finn (a pseudonym for William Morrow v-p and executive editor Dan Mallory) has written a tense, darkly funny, psychologically sound thriller.

Originally posted at Vampire Book Club

After earning her first mark Kyra, at nineteen, has become the youngest current Markswoman for the Order of Kali, the oldest of the five Orders in Asiana. The Orders consist of groups of elite warrior women who are bonded to and fight with their katari swordswe won't mention the anomaly that is the Order of Kuhr, youngest of the Orders, and made up of Marksmen.

Ever since being adopted into the Order at the age of five after the brutal slaying of her family and people, Kyra has long held the hope of avenging her familys death, and with becoming a Markswoman, shes one step closer to being able to make that a reality. Her plans are pushed back, however, when Shirin Mam, the head of the Order of Kali dies unexpectedly, and Kyra immediately senses foul play. In order to stay alive long enough to see justice served, Kyra runs, and encounters help from where she least expected it: from the Marksmen of the Order of Kuhr.

Now, preparing for the fight of her life, with the help of fellow Marksman Rustan, Kyra learns what it truly means to be a Markswoman, and to wield the magic of her katari.

Markswoman boasts a wonderful dystopian view of Asia that, upon finishing, I immediately wanted to jump right back into. I can honestly not tell you how much Im looking forward to learning more about this unique world and its history. Rati Mehrotra does a great job of making the story one that deftly straddles the line between YA and adult, and I think we could see this shift as Kyra grows in future books.

The growth that Kyra experiences in this book alone is exponential. She starts out as a novice, just having taken her first life. Dealing with the consequences of being the person to end someone elses existence, even though it was sanctioned, carries weight. Her need for revenge also clouds her judgment a little, but when her teacher dies, everything she thought she knew, everything shes been taught, is challenged.

On the opposite side we have Rustan. Hes a couple of years older than Kyra and a little more experienced, but hes just had to take care of a difficult mark himself and begins to question the validity of the Order. As Kyra and Rustan work together their separate views of the Order give them each new perspective, hopefully paving a way for the Order to get past many of its antiquated traditions.

One minor thing that kept this from being a fully five-star read for me was the development of Kyra and Rustans relationship. Over the course of the story, Kyra and Rustan grow closer than is considered proper by many in the Order. Its something they both struggle with, but lends weight to their changing view of the Order. However, I felt like instead of putting a little more focus into showcasing scenes of Kyra and Rustan overcoming their prejudices towards ones another, it gets overshadowed a bit too much by world-building. I felt like one page they loathed each other, and the next they loved each other. I wanted to see more of the progression. Im hoping that subsequent sequels will put a little more focus on their burgeoning relationship.

Markswoman hits a lot of pros on my list. A strong, yet still flawed, central heroine coming more into her powers, and the brooding hero who helps her, along with a vast and interesting worldbetter get the Best Of List started.",1516665600,5

I think this is the way my brain chose to tell me that the book wasn't perfect, but I still enjoyed reading it. I liked the book. When I think of it while trying to write this review I remember the wooden penguin that's missing, Kylie's bad choices of outfits when she didn't want to be recognized and her dog, which sounded adorable despite the snoring. The book had a lot of great moments and I was very happy when I was reading it.

My favorite character is going to be Kylie. She is feisty, smart and the kind of person that I would like to have into my life. She is a great heroine who doesn't complain and doesn't think she can do everything on her own when that is not true. She acted perfectly in this book and she now has a spot in my heart. All the characters that appear in this book (with the exception of a couple) made me feel like I was a part of their cycle because they were already familiar to me through the previous books and I liked seeing them again.

I know it's bad, but I enjoyed the way the villain tormented Kylie. I don't know why, but I couldn't be mad at the person who was staging those photographs. If a friend of Kylie's did this for fun I might have even laughed and that's the reason why I am a bad person. I loved the penguin's ending though. It was a very sweet scene. The rest of the book was light-hearted and sometimes funny.

In the end, the book is good. Joe might not have been the greatest hero, now that I think about it, but he was at least on my good side. I think he might be the reason behind the absence of the 1 star. Anyway, the book was good and I enjoyed it, so I would recommend it.

6051,484,652,"To say that this book shocked me is an understatement. When I finished reading the book, I had to reread that ending a few times to make sure I fully comprehended what just happened. It took me a while to fully grasp the ramifications and be able to come to terms with it. The story got into my head, and really bothered me in ways I cannot describe.

In short, the story is about Mary B. Addison, a young black girl who was convicted of allegedly killing a 3 month old white baby at 9 years of age, while she was babysitting with her mother one evening. Throughout all the trials, Mary never said a word to defend herself, she took the punishment, neither denying nor confirming the accusations, while her mother was let go.

The media had a field day with the story, raising hell about a black girl killing a white baby, and demanding retribution, regardless of her age. At present, Mary is 15 or 16 and is still required to stay at a juvenile home for troubled youth until the age of 19. The entire story is told from her perspective, and as the story progresses, we slowly begin to peel back the layers of her personality as we get to know her more and more intimately. We sympathize with her situation, we trust her and we feel what she feels, injustice, unfairness, fear, frustration, determination and loveso much love for her unborn baby. When she finds out that she is pregnant, Mary decides to do all that is in her power to keep her baby, and that means finally speaking out about what really happened that night and who was responsible for the death of the child. She tries to get a proper education, studying for her SATs so she can get into college, struggling to make a better life for herself and her baby, but is constantly being pushed back. We get a very intimate look at life in a juvenile home, the brutality experienced, the monstrosity of some of the people who end up there and the peers that are assigned to look after them.

I could feel Marys struggle and frustration. Her mothers calm and religious persona, which was hypocritical and made me want to gouge her eyes out, was incredibly infuriating. I wanted to strangle her once the whole story is finally revealed and we find out exactly what occurred that dark night. I genuinely rooted for Mary and wanted to see her story shared and the case reopened for trial. I wanted to see her win, I wanted justice served and I wanted her to be able to keep her baby. Marys voice is strong, she reels you in and keeps you hanging on to her every word. You trust her. You believe her. You cheer her on.

The twist at the end was so unpredictable, I never saw it coming, and it seems from the reviews Ive read that no one else has. That is what made me give the book a 5 star rating, because despite the fact that I felt certain parts of it dragged and despite the fact that I was ready to give up on it, it completely managed to shake me and leave a huge impact on me. There aren't many books I can say that about.

I was honestly appalled at how graphically violent this book was. It made me very uncomfortable reading some parts, while I had to skim through other parts, especially concerning the details of the babys injuries. It made me want to cry and gag and just set down the book and never pick it up again. It was a difficult read. It was really challenging getting through it, and at the end, my head ached, my brain ached and my whole body ached. I did not realize how tightly wound I was until I had finished the book, let me shoulders down and felt my muscles creak with exhaustion.

This book took it out of me, so a word of caution: tread carefully, because the content is very mature and unpleasant, but the ending  for me  was worth the trouble.",1516665600,5

>>>>> My Synopsis (Review Follows): <<<<<

""May you Walk on water and pass through fire...""

Centuries ago there was a war to end all wars--The Great War. Not much is left from the time period known as the golden age. Much of the structures are gone, and the rule of Kings and Queens has long since passed. No texts survived and knowledge of the technology was lost to the sands of time. Asiana had to be rebuilt from the ground up using whatever scraps and pieces the survivors could find and salvage.

""To live we must die, and to rule we must serve, and to uphold the peace we must kill...""

Asiana was divided into five sections. Each one ruled and policed by one of the five Orders of Peace--Kali, Zorya, Valavan, Mat-su and Khur. All the Orders, save one, are run entirely by women known as the Markswomen. The exception is the Order of Khur, the youngest of all the Orders. It is the only one comprised entirely of men--the Marksmen. The Orders were formed upon the recommendations made in texts written at the end of the Great War by the last ruling King of Asiana. Known as the Kanun of Ture-asa, it bound all the clans and established the law of the land.

""The katari belongs to you. But you need to make sure that your emotions don't rule your blade.""

Markswomen and Marksmen are the highly trained force who mete out justice and the only ones legally allowed to kill. With each kill they mark their skin with a cut, hence, their name. Inner Speech is the gift of kalishium which is what the Markswomen's/Marksmen's katari's are made from. A Markswoman bonds telepathically with their weapon and when properly trained, they can read and control other people's minds and actions. The deeper the bond, the greater the ability.

""We must remember who we kill and why. Our blood for theirs.""

One young Markswoman will seek justice for the Mahimata (the leader) of her Order whom she believes met her end by foul play. In doing so she will come to find her path in the world, and come to understand what her beloved friend and mentor had tried to teach her and why.

""Being a Markswoman is not about taking revenge. If you kill in anger, you are no better than the ones you execute.""

The Orders have worked for over eight hundred years, but the world changes with time and so must everyone along with it. It is whispered that the power of the Orders is beginning to fade. Kyra's quest for justice will make her begin to question the way of the Orders, and lead her on a different path than the one she planned. Her quest will bring about the winds of change.

""Let the past be what it is. Let the future bring what it will. Stay in the present. Be aware of yourself and who you are. It is all that matters.""

>>>>> My Review: <<<<<
I really liked this story. It took me some time to get into because there is a whole lot to this universe, so it took me awhile to get acclimated. Gradually, we learn more about Asiana and the Orders of Peace as Kyra completes her final test before being formerly accepted into the sisterhood of Markswomen. Kyra is one of the youngest in the Order of Kali and we get to see her earn her first mark. She's lived with the Order since the age of five when her family and entire clan was murdered. Kyra found her place in the Order, and can't imagine not being part of it. When the leader of her Order is found dead, a women who was very much like a mother to Kyra, she believes foul play is involved, especially since the person she suspects of doing it will become Shirin Mam's successor. Kyra quickly disengages herself from the Order on the ruse of seeking out the rightful heir to Shirin Mam's katari. The journey that ensues takes her on one of discovery. She learns things about herself, the Orders, and her teacher. It helps her to see things more clearly and ready her for what is to come.

You see, when Kyra left on her quest, she was marked a defector. In order for her to go home she'll need to challenge the new Mahimata to a duel. Prior to Tamsyn's promotion to Mahimata, she was the Order's Mistress of Mental Arts and the Hand of Kali--Shirin Mam's executioner of choice. No one dares challenge Tamsyn because of her fierce reputation with her blade. Luckily, when Kyra finds herself literally at the door of the Order of Khur, they take her in and agree to train her so she'll have a chance at beating Tamsyn. It's there that she'll learn things that have been kept from her and realize the importance of Shirin Mam's teachings, and start to question some of the practices of the Orders.

The katari blades reminded me a little of the Shardblades in Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series. The Orders with their 'good vs evil' mentality and mind bending skills reminded me a touch of the Jedi of Star Wars fame. The references to the 'Ones' had me a little baffled. Who exactly are they, where did they come from, and what, if any, role did they play in the coming about of the Great War? Those questions have yet to be answered. Then there are the doors which appear to be remnants of the technology from the world long since destroyed. They seem to be passageways not only to other places in Asiana, but are they also a means to travel through time? I found these very cool yet also very confusing. I hope at some point how they work will be more fully explained. They kind of reminded me of the movie Arrival and how things seemed to get a little out of sequence (time wise) and you needed to figure out how they fit together.

Overall, I gave this one 4 1/2 out of 5 roses. I loved the relationships in this tale especially the one blooming between Kyra and Rustan, and look forward to seeing how this love affair will grow. There were quite a few interesting twists and turns which kept me glued to the pages once I settled into the story. The world building was phenomenal, although we've only seen a small portion of it. The series is shaping up to be something special, but I was left with a lot of unanswered questions. The author seeded the story with so many puzzle pieces that, as of yet, don't quite fit together though we're starting to see the edges of it take shape. It's the type of story that gives your imagination lease to run wild and try to puzzle it out before the next book. I'm guessing this was a ploy by the author to keep my interest piqued until the next installment comes out. Depending on how those questions are answered and how things are explained and handled, this series could become one of my favorites. I'm cautiously optimistic that that will be the case, but we'll have to wait and see where the author takes it. I look forward to seeing if any of my hypotheses are correct.

****Notes to keep you in the know...

--There seems to be a touch of concepts from the Hindu religion woven into the story...

Mahimata is a term which literally means Mother Earth.

Kali is a goddess in the Hindu religion known as the Goddess of destruction. Said by some to be the destroyer of evil forces and by others the destroyer of ego. She is also known and worshiped for being the Divine Mother or Mother of the Universe. She is also hailed by some to be a protector and the one who bestows moksha, or liberation.

--There also seems to be a little buddhism woven in too...

The wheel of life with eight spokes is primarily used only in Buddhism and is often times referred to as the wheel of Dharma. The eight spokes represent the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism which are said to (depending on where you look) lead either to spiritual enlightenment, Nirvana, or pain relief.

6054,972,748,"I guess based on the reviews, I was expecting to be laughing my butt off throughout most of the book, which was not the case at all. I've read love/hate stories, particularly office co-worker ones before, so I've always enjoyed the antics that the main characters do to each other and I was hoping for some fun times here. Nope! We barely got any, if at all, of the games I was hoping for. I kept waiting and waiting for the fun to start and NOTHING!

I think that much of the humor comes from being in the mind of Lucinda. Her thoughts about Joshua and her co-workers were pretty hilarious, but in reality, it only garnered some mild chuckles from my end. She's sweet and I really liked her, but the story itself fell flat and I honestly didn't care for Joshua. I sympathized with him and his situation with his family, but yeah, I didn't care for him.

It also bugged me how blatantly obvious a LOT of the stuff was in this book and how clueless the MC's were about it. I mean, I'll give them a little bit of cluelessness, it's part of the writing game of course, but I think the author made Lucinda a bit too dense when she otherwise was such a smart, witty, and skillful character. She was so observant of her surroundings, particularly when it came to Joshua, yet she didn't see anything coming. Even if I could overlook the fact that she didn't know about the attraction and feelings he had for her, the one ""big secret"" he was keeping from her was so damn obvious and so many clues were given throughout the book, it was like the author was slapping Lucinda in the face with it repeatedly and yet she still didn't get it.

So yes, while I enjoyed this book in an ""it wasn't a total waste of time"" sense, I was sorely disappointed overall. I know a lot of others got a lot of laughs from this book, but for me, it left much to be desired.",1516665600,3
6055,923,27,For many years I have felt that author Alison Gaylin deserves to have her novels produced in hardcover rather than relegated to the paperback original market.  Her work has been nominated for Edgar and Shamus awards and each one is tautly written and on par with anything else on the psychological thriller market.  IF I DIE TONIGHT is no exception. Set in the mystical and haunting Hudson Valley region of New York State we find a strange woman bounding into the Havenkill police station late one night with a story that will open up a myriad of plotlines involving several different characters.

This story is a very well-written one, with a unique premise. Tremblay did a great job creating a story that had me hooked from the beginning, and wouldn't let me go until the end. The finale was a bit of a shock, and I am impressed with his smooth writing style and gripping characters.

6060,228,22,"My niece has just snagged the role of Mrs. Corry in her high school production of Mary Poppins so I decided to read the original book. I was terribly disappointed in it. While Mary Poppins does make it possible for the children to experience wonderful and fanciful things, Mary, herself, is a very mean person. She lies to the children and gets angry at them for talking to her about what they have seen with her. At another points she steals their stars. She is also almost always in a bad mood. In fact, the only person shes actually completely nice to and considerate of is Bert. Its difficult for me to understand why the children come to like her so much. In the movie, she leaves when the wind changes, but this occurs only after she has fixed the family dynamic so that the childrens parents begin to take an interest in them. That does not happen in the book. The wind changes and Mary Poppins leaves without even saying goodbye to the children. I wouldnt recommend this one.",1516665600,2
6061,986,435,"Even though I don't really know Amy Schumer or her work, I was still intrigued enough to want to pick up The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo. The fact that this memoir has been praised a LOT did also help of course. I was fully expecting to be loving this read, but I ended up feeling the complete opposite. Oh yes, it's time for another unpopular review... Did you really think I could go that long without one? I don't think my opinion has all that much to do with the fact I don't really know her... It's more that her writing style, crudy humor and sexual talk simply aren't a right fit for me. The humor felt kind of forced-funny, but then again my sense of humor has always been a bit 'special' and I don't like what most people like. What was a surprise is that The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo was actually a lot darker and self-confessional than I thought it would be, especially since it's labeled humor. Kuddos to her for having the guts to share all this personal stuff... Although if I got it right she kind of does the same thing in her shows. I guess her humor and writing style either works for you, or it doesn't. Unfortunately I belong to the second group, and honestly I kind of struggled making it to the last page.

He's broken by harsh men, beat into submission to be rebuilt as a strong, tireless sled pulling machine.  He runs on a small ration of fish per day, learns the ways of the sled dog, and slowly takes over as leader of the pack. (Vroom vroom!).

6069,4,162,"There were many places in the debut novel titled, The Chilbury Ladies' Choir, by Jennifer Ryan where she could have veered into soap opera. Instead, this story of World War II life in an English village stayed focused on developing interesting characters and developing an engaging plot. Part of Ryan's structure involves letters from individual characters, and I found that approach fresh and interesting. There's a harmony in this novel beyond the vocal talents of the choir members in the title. Village life during the Battle of Britain drew me into the story and led me to care about every character.

6074,559,1778,"About That Kiss is book five in the Heartbreaker Bay series by Jill Shalvis.  This bookthis series!  Ive loved it from the start but this one just might be my favorite.  Or do I think that after every book?

Kylie Masters is a very talented wood worker.  She is working for her long time friend, Gib at Reclaimed Woods.  Kylie never knew her Dad and her Mom was more interested in her long string of boyfriends, so Kylie was raised by her Grandfather who was also a well known wood worker.  He taught her everything she knew but he died in a fire a few years ago and Kylie still misses him every day.

Joe Malone was ex-military and now worked for a security firm in the same building.  He and Kylie have known each other casually for the year that theyd both been working in the building.  Until a couple of nights ago when they kissed.  It wasn't just any kiss either.  It was a kiss that makes your pulse speed up, makes your blood boil, and makes you wish for things that you know cant be.  Because Joe Malone is not emotionally available.  Hes hot, hes sweet, but he is not a forever kind of guy.

Kylie always thought she wanted safe.  Had even had a school girl crush on Gib.  But after that kiss, she knew she didn't want safe at all.  She wanted wild, hot and sweaty.  She wanted Joe.  But she isn't a one night stand kind of girl.  Could she be?  Could she just so she knew how it could be with him?

Now for the character that stole this book, Kylies little dog, Vinnie.  This little guy was adorable.  She would let him snuggle up in her hoodie pocket.  He went everywhere with her.

All Kylie had to remember her Grandfather by was a little three inch carving of a penguin.  She kept it with her all of the time.  But its missing.  And now she started getting mysterious photos of her penguin in various dangerous places.  Who would do this?  What do they want?  Kylie knows she needs help in getting to the bottom of this so she is forced to ask Joe for help.  No way, though, is Kylie going to let Joe do this alone.  Its her carving, and she wants to help.

It doesnt take long for another kiss to follow the first one as Kylie and Joe spend time together while trying to track down her penguin.  As Kylie and Joe work through a list of possible suspects, they get to know each other better and feelings develop and deepen.  Kylie knows Joe cant give her what she needs but she cant help but to fall for this man.  And she knows he feels something too.  He just doesnt want to admit it to himself, or her.

On the quest to save Kylies penguin, these two perhaps are saving each other at the same time.  Saving each other from guilt over past events, from loneliness, and showing each other what could be, if they let it.

I am in love with this book.  Every page was a joy.  These two were amazing, or three if you count little Vinnie.  This is one of those books that just makes you happy and gives you all the warm and fuzzy tummy twirls you can handle.  Jill Shalvis, you rock!  Thank you for this amazing book.",1516665600,5
6075,596,1778,"This was great!  I am really enjoying this series and this book was no exception.  This is the fifth book in the Heartbreaker Bay series but it could easily be read as a stand alone since it does tell its own story.  I would warn new readers to the series that you will want to read the other books in this amazing series as soon you finish this one just because you will want to spend a little more time with these amazing characters.  I had a lot of fun spending time with the group and watching Joe and Kylie find their happily ever after.

Joe and Kylie are the focus of this book.  I have been waiting to read Joe's story since I love his character.  I really was curious about what his story was and this book did not disappoint.  We get to learn a bit about Joe and Molly's history in this book and it wasn't anything I could have expected.  It was great to really get to know Joe.  Kylie was also a wonderful character.  I thought that her past was just as interesting as Joe's.  Neither Joe nor Kylie has had an ideal childhood but they are both strong individuals that have been able to move past it.

I loved Joe and Kylie together.  I loved it every single time they were together in this book.  The chemistry between them was intense.  It wasn't just about the chemistry because they really had fun with each other.  It seemed like they were both people that really needed a true friend that they could count on and they filled that role for each other.  There were a few more comical moments in the story and I really enjoyed seeing them laugh together.

They mystery in the story was well done.  Kylie asks Joe to help her find the wooden penguin that her grandfather gave to her.  Sounds easy right?  Well, it was anything but easy.  This pair spend a lot of time together checking out leads and going on the occasional stake out.  Things go wrong from time to time but they are both determined to figure out what is going on.

I would highly recommend this book to others.  I found this book to be an absolute delight to read and I couldn't get enough of Joe and Kylie.  I can't wait to watch another couple find love in Heartbreaker Bay!

In this case, another of the mighty investigators at Hunter Investigation falls.  Joe Malone has seen and known Kylie for a long time but hasn't let himself get involved.  He doesn't do relationships and she doesn't do one night stands - until they do.
It all starts when someone kidnaps her small carved penguin.  It is her last tie to her dead grandfather who raised her.  Joe agrees to investigate the penguin-napping.  He tries to be all business but Kylie won't let him do it alone.  She insists on being part of the investigation team.  The longer they spend time together, the harder it is to deny their feelings.
Ms Shalvis writes entertaining dialogue and the way she writes about the friendships between all the woman is a delight to read.

Can she please just keep adding new books to it forever? They make me totally heart-eyed every single time and I don't think I'll ever get enough of them.

About That Kiss is the story of Joe and Kylie. I absolutely adored both of them. Their story was fun, yet still had plenty of feels. And kissing. There was lots of that, too. Neither Joe nor Kylie were looking for a relationship, but their chemistry was undeniable  even if they tried  and the more time they spent together, the more apparent it became there was something special brewing. I read half this book with a giant, cheesy grin on my face and totally loved every minute of their story.

The Heartbreaker Bay series is rife with characters I've fallen for... hard. Joe and Kylie were stellar, obviously, but I also really enjoyed getting to see some of my favorites from earlier in the series again. I'm also looking forward to Molly's story because I think I'm half in girl crush mode with her already. (Oh how I hope her book is next!) It's not just the humans who bring something special to this series either. Kylie's dog Vinnie? Oh. My. Heart. He was just about the cutest and most charming little guy EVER  and this is coming from someone who really isn't a dog person. But, oh did he melt my heart.

6078,1074,16,"Angie Thomas has created one of those books, you know, the ones you pick up and cant put down so you binge read it within a matter of days, ignoring calls, staying home missing out on events just to finish it. I don't know what took me so long to pick up this book, I had seen pictures of the book all over social media, but until I read the book jacket for myself I wasn't dedicated to adding it to my library. The story was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, the title The Hate U Give was inspired by Tupacs concept of Thug Life; explained in an interview Tupac gave years ago.

The Hate U Give tells a story police brutality from a witnesss point of view, uncovering the devastating effects on the friends and family, the community and culture in the aftermath of such a tragedy. The main character Starr comes from the hood but attends a private school where she is one of the very few black kids. She balances the two worlds as best as she can keeping them as separate as possible. Its not until she witnesses the death of her close friend that her worlds collide fully opening her eyes up to the differences between both environments.

Never be ashamed of who you are and where you come from; I cant change where I come from or what Ive been through, so why should I be ashamed of what makes me, me?. One of the underlying themes in this book urges readers to take pride in where you are from no matter how glorious or poverty stricken that area may be. Theres beauty in each of these places depending on how you look at it. Towards the very end of the novel the main characters father is trying to revive his roses that be brought with him from the hood to their new suburban home. When asked whether they will survive he replies Yeah. A lil damaged, but alive. Im gon try something different with them. Putting them in new soil can be like hitting a reset button. Starrs mother wants to leave the hood where as her father wants to stay, many people today struggle with this same decision, once you make enough to make it out do you stay or do you go? Are those who choose to leave giving up on their communities? I don't know if the fathers dedication to the sustainment of his roses is pure irony or perfect symbolism, based off of Tupacs most famous poems The Rose That Grew From Concrete.

Starr also has a white boyfriend from school and the complexity of interracial dating comes to light. As much as she tries to be herself she is never fully herself, never allowing Chris to visit her home, never telling him about the problems surrounding her involvement in the murder of her best friends.

This book examines several struggles those in the black community face such as racism, classism and police brutality, it is an easily enjoyable read for anyone 14 and up and is priced at $18 for the hardback version. I would recommend this read and will probably purchase a couple copies for my niece and a friend.

The Wife grabbed me from the very first chapter. The writing was tight, and the pacing was on point. When Angelas husband was accused of sexual harrassment, and later sexual assault of a different woman, would she continue to stand by her husband? How far would she go to protect him? And just what is it about her past that keeps her in this marriage?

The last chapter is perfection. I was able to figure out one of the twists, but not the other; but it took me until later in the book to put my finger on it. On another twist, I followed one red herring so far in the wrong direction that I practically landed in the water with it!

6084,16,1510,"Oh, Alafair Burke, you have outdone yourself with your new novel, The Wife! Brilliant, addictive, full of twists - and that last line ending? Perfect!

I was hooked from the opening line: ""In an instant, I became the woman they assumed I'd been all along: the wife who lied to protect her husband.""

The husband, Jason, is a celebrated public figure. When one of his interns makes an accusation against him, the foundations of his public and private lives begin to crumble. His wife, Angela, has secrets in her past that she wants to keep out of the public light. And she doesn't want her son exposed to any of it. What will Angela do to keep that secret? To protect her husband? Her son? Is Jason guilty? Or is he the victim of a campaign to discredit him and his work? Ahh, a delicious premise and one I couldn't wait to dig into!

The Wife falls into the genre of 'domestic thriller'. This has fast become a favourite for me. I love not knowing who is telling the truth, the possibilities of whodunit, the turns and twists that jump out of a chapter to surprise me, and unexpected endings.

""To know something, he argued, was not the same as to be certain beyond all doubt. And to believe something was definitely not the sane as to know it.""

Burke's characters are so well drawn, coming alive in my imagination. Angela is portrayed as a sympathetic character - but does she deserve it? I was happy to see Olivia Randall in this novel. She's a high powered defense attorney last seen in Burke's previous book, The Ex. (And I hope we see her again.) The dialogue flows easily, the plotting is addictive and the prose are so very 'readable.'

The Wife benefits greatly from Burke's legal background. (Burke teaches criminal law) The case, the police investigation and the legal machinations are so well portrayed and unfold in a believable manner. Suspense, mystery, police procedural and some social commentary - The Wife has it all. This is one you're going to want to pick up. I loved it!",1516665600,5
6085,275,1510,"Part police procedural and part domestic drama, The Wife by Alafair Burke is an engrossing, twist-filled mystery.

Angela Powell is a happily married stay at home mom to thirteen year old Spencer. Her husband,Jason, is an economics professor whose bestselling book about socially conscious investing has resulted in a lucrative consulting business and guest spots on news programs. Angela eschews the limelight and works hard to maintain a well-ordered, structured life for her family. Their domestic bliss slowly begins to unravel when Jasons intern, Rachel Sutton, accuses him of sexual harassment. But what really rocks the foundation of their life is an allegation from a client, Kerry Lynch, that soon leads to Jasons arrest. Determined to stand by her husband, Angela is stunned by numerous revelations about her husband. When Kerry goes missing, Jason is the prime suspect in her disappearance and SVU Detective Corrine Duncan is asking Angela some very hard questions about the night Kerry vanished.

Angela grew up in a blue-collar family who resides in a playground of the rich and famous.  She and her best friend, Trisha Faulkner, ran a little wild and had a few brushes with the law.  But Angela moved past her rather troubled past and when she met Jason, she was running a successful catering business. Not really looking for love, Jason nonetheless won her over and they have been happily married for six years when trouble strikes. Angela has worked very hard to maintain a low profile and although Jason is well-aware of her past, no one else has stumbled onto her secrets. As Jasons very public problems thrust them into the media spotlight, one of Angelas biggest fears is her past will be uncovered.

Corrine is a tenacious investigator who is not jaded by the sexual assault cases she works so hard to solve. She is genuinely concerned that Angela is putting Jasons interests before her own. No matter how worried she about Angela, Corrine has no reason to doubt that Kerry is telling the truth about Jason and she works hard to find the evidence she needs to solidify her case. After Kerry vanishes, she is not officially assigned to the case, but Corrine cannot remain on the sidelines during the investigation.

The Wife is an intricately plotted and very clever mystery that is mostly written from Angelas perspective. She is a  complex character whose tragic past makes her a sympathetic and credible narrator. Her continued loyalty to Jason is admirable but might be misplaced as the truth about her husband slowly begins to emerge.  Savvy readers might surmise some of the upcoming twists, but Alafair Burke brilliantly saves the most shocking revelations for the novels jaw-dropping, stunning conclusion.

The City of Brass is a powerful #ownvoices debut novel people. S.A. Chakrabortys debut novel follows the story ofNahri. She is an orphaned con artist living in eighteenth-century Cairo. She doesnt know who she is, who her parents are, or how she is able to heal people. She also can understand and respond to seemingly any language without prior knowledge of the said language includinga strange tongue she somehow knows even though shes never heard anyone else speak it. Nahri is a 20 something young woman with no hope and does tons of swindling activities in order to survive. She has dreams of one day going to Istanbul to learn to heal properly. While executing a phony healing ceremony, she accidentally calls on Dara, a powerful djinn with a violent past and reveals that Nahri ispart djinn, descended from a long line of healers. To be safe she must flee Cairo as she is a target for ifrit (evil djinn with no souls who are her familys enemies).We then follow her and Dara as they make their way to Daevebad where only those with djinn blood can enter. Daevabad is far from perfect the rulers oppress the shafit(half-djinn) and there is always the threat of rebellion and war. Nahri is actually part of the tribe that conflicted with the current ruling tribe. She swapped the oppressive powers of France and the Ottoman Empire in her native Egypt for a new set of injustices and oppression.

1) Characters

""But terrified as she was, the sound of her native language was intoxicating, and she didn't want the mysterious stranger to stop speaking.""

Nahri is a smart young woman with incredible healing abilities and a master of languages. I love how real she was we got to see her be confident and sarcastic but also very scared and make decisions that weren't always the best. We learn that she is a very powerful being from the Nahid tribe and the last of her kind. Her gifts are apart of Nahid culture. I want to see her really understand her people and not be swayed by the royals. Dara is a powerful Afshin that are connected to the Nahid. He sounds sexy and wonderful. I love how complex he is without even getting his point of view. But, I didn't like how some characters spoke of him but we didn't get to hear his POV. Ali was interesting but also a little insufferable. I want to see how far he will go and if he will actually do something about his corrupt family. The side characters were all very complex and a lot were morally grey and touched on real things.

2) Plot

""Go,"" he urged. ""I promise not to go to war without your permission,"" he added with a sharp smile at the Qahtanis.

The plot of this story was exceptional and it beautifully highlighted Middle Eastern culture. The pace was amazing and picked up right away. There were many plot twists and I won't spoil them but just know that even if things appear gone I think the author is setting us up for something amazing in book two.

3) Writing/World Building

""Because on the day of your judgment, Alizayd...when you're asked why you didn't stand up for what you knew was just..."" He paused, his next words finding Ali's heart like an arrow. ""Loyalty to your family won't excuse you.""

The story is rich in Egyptian and Middle Eastern culture and history. As a PageHabit book, we got annotations from the author throughout the book which gives us the authors personal touch and feelings in the story. Since she has been to many of the places and I think part of the culture this really elevated the story. The dialogue is very well done as well. The City of Brass (Daevabad) sounds gorgeous and is a place of different tribes and people. The description that the author writes really transports you to this world.

4) Romance

But Dara went no furtherthough there was no denying the flash of regret in his eyes as his thumb lightly brushed her lower lip. ""I'm coming back, Nahri,"" he promised. ""You're my Banu Nahida. This is my city."" His expression was defiant. ""Nothing will keep me from either of you.""

I really love Nahri and Dara and the relationship brewing. I don't know what will happen in book two but I know it will only get better. It was sexy and their banter was so fun.",1516665600,5
6087,111,1778,"Kylie Masters is a woodworker, but on that day it was her turn to mind the Reclaimed Woods front desk. Of course, Joe Malone would choose that moment to step into the shop. A few days ago, when she was a bit tipsy, Kylie and Joe had shared a passionate kiss, nothing came of it, and Kylie tried to forget about it; it seemed Joe had. Joe is shopping for a present for his sister Molly, but the mirror he had in mind  one of Kylies creations  has already been sold, so he commissions a similar one. Case closed, thinks Kylie, but not quite. As shes leaving the shop, Kylie notices that her precious wooden penguin, the only thing she has left from her late grandfather, is missing. Upon opening her front door, theres an envelope with a photograph showing her penguin in peril. Desperate times call for desperate measures: she needs Joes help; its his job after all, he works for Hunt Investigations. If it weren't for that kiss

In this fifth book in the Heartbreaker Bay series, faithful readers get to catch up with characters from previous books, while newcomers will feel entirely at ease dropping by. I really liked that Kylie has an unusual occupation, and that she is not your typical Jill Shalvis klutz, although Kylie is a bit shy and insecure but she does have a funny pooch. I was quite pleased that what first appeared a little joke of a mystery turned out to be quite an ingenious one. The romance progressed at a realistic pace, and some of the best moments in ABOUT THAT KISS consist of Joe and Kylies exchanges about their pasts. Ms. Shalvis descriptions of Joes childhood neighbourhood bordered on postapocalyptic, as our inner cities often appear. I felt that the story dragged a bit in the middle, as there was some meandering in several directions, and while Joe is a good and sweet man, his determination to deny that he was in love with Kylie grated a bit. On the other hand, Kylie handled his obstinacy surprisingly well and I thought Ms. Shalvis did an amazing job: Kylie never came across as a victim or a wimp, and I really liked her.

There are also superb secondary characters in ABOUT THAT KISS, namely Molly  Joes sister and Kylies mother. ABOUT THAT KISS is cute, light, flirty, and there is a silly puppy that will steal your heart.

6088,567,1778,"I love this series--and Kylie and Joe's story was exactly what I'd been hoping for when I read the teaser at the end of the last Heartbreaker Bay book :)

The chemistry between Kylie and Joe is perfectly delicious. They shared a kiss some time before the book begins (hence the title) which hasn't had any follow up and has gotten Kylie's back up big time--she's prepared to not give Joe the time of day for the rest of time...until she needs his help. I'll admit that at first I thought Kylie's quest was a bit on the silly side (a family treasure is missing) but I should have known better; of course Ms. Shalvis would make it work 100%! Joe, Kylie, and the reader all have to work to figure out whodunnit, and that story thread is resolved just as satisfyingly as is Joe and Kylie's HEA.

In between, Vinnie, Kylie's dog, is one of my new favorite fictional dogs (OMG, what he finally decides to fetch will make you LOL) and I can't even tell you how many bits of dialogue I highlighted as I read. I just can't say enough about how much I enjoy Ms. Shalvis's writing style in these books--they are funny and sexy and heartwarming, all in one package that it's nearly impossible to put down until you're done.

About that Kiss is the fifth book in the series, but like the others, it could be read as a standalone--there's slight spoilers as to who ends up with whom, but that can be figured out from the books' blurbs anyway. A warning, though--reading any story about this group of friends will pretty much ensure that you'll want to read all of their stories! (Molly and Lucas are coming up soon, yes? ;))

When their scavenger hunt search also leads to discoveries about each otherand the layers they hide behind, will Kylie and Joe see their way past their kiss to something more?

I don't think I will ever tire of reading about the awesome characters living in Heartbreaker Bay. Each one more unique than the next. Each one with a bit of a pastand their own reason for living there. It's an amazing community of friends and I would never move if I lived there too!!

I loved the developing relationship between Joe and Kylie, and the suspense element of their search. Both Kylie and Joe are strong mindedstubborn even. And their desire for each other was fun to watch them fight. But those kissesplus a skosh of jealousy proved that is wasn't just About That Kiss, it was about the promise of more.

6090,757,1778,"Kylie Masters missed her grandfather terribly. He was an extraordinary woodworking artist and a loving guardian. Although Kylie wasn't as talented as her late grandfather, her woodworking was still remarkable and sought after. Kylie was embarrassed by her mothers flirtatious and loose behavior. Kylie kept a tight control over her emotions. She didn't want to become her mother. But after a favorite possession of hers was stolen, and she started, to receive blackmail notes regarding it, Kylie enlisted the help of a handsome investigator, one whom she once shared a kiss with, Joe Malone.

Kylie sincerely hoped that she hadnt inherited her mothers provocative ways. Keeping her sexual feelings hidden was Kylies norm. But, when it came to Joe Malone, control seemed to be the farthest thing from Kylies mind. And the more time she spent with Joe, the harder it became to resist the handsome investigator.

About That Kiss is an enjoyable read. If you love romance with a bit of mystery, this may be just the book for you.

6091,645,1778,"My Review:
I liked this story. Neither Kylie nor Joe want or need a relationship, but they keep drifting toward one another. One drunken night they shared a kiss and now neither one can forget it. It's best to just stay away from one another.

But then Kylie's beloved carved penguin made for her by her grandfather is stolen and a threatening photo arrives. Her grandfather was a talented woodworker, but he and almost all his work were destroyed in a fire at his workshop. The penguin is all she has left. But the villain won't return it unless Kylie falsely authenticates some woodworking as her grandfather's.

Joe works for Archer's security firm and is as tough and smart as they come, so he's the one she turns to for help. She needs her penguin back, but isn't willing to sully her grandfather's reputation with sub-standard woodworking. They have to work together to try to find out who is trying to bribe her. And you know what all that time together is going to do for them...this is a romance novel. ;)

Both of these characters have good reasons for being leery of relationships. But I loved watching them fall for one another when they had no idea that could even happen. Joe is gruff and sexy and protective. And it's awesome watching him fall apart and lose control over Kylie. Kylie can admit that Joe is a darn sexy man, but she's been left by way too many people. She's better off alone than getting hurt again. She just wants her penguin back.

But as the two work more and more together, their friendship and understanding of the other person deepens...and that sexual chemistry sure isn't going away. This was a sexy, fun read. I liked the little details about Joe's history with his sister Molly and how that all plays into his protective stance with Kylie. I also loved watching all the guys who work with Joe at Archer's security firm give Joe a hard time...bromance at its best.

This was just a fun book to read...and it had the added bonus of a light bit of mystery and suspense added to the story that kicked it up a notch. LOVED that!

I definitely recommend this and the entire series, although you can read any of the books as stand alones.

When someone steals it, and holds it hostage she is completely devastated, and is desperate to get it back... even if it means turning to the one person she has always steered clear of... Joe Malone. It's not that she doesn't like Joe, problem is she likes him a little too much, but relationships give her hives, and a one night stands just aren't her thing, so it's best just to keep him at a distance... but now she needs him and his investigative skills! Now if she can just manage to keep her hormones in check while working right alongside him...

Joe Malone can't believe the words coming out of Kylie's mouth, she wants him to help her find a wooden penguin, he isn't real keen on getting involved, but he can't help but notice the hurt that is written all over her face, and dang it if he doesn't want to make her happy again. He agrees to help, and assumes he can more than handle the task alone, but Kylie refuses to let him go at it alone, she wants to help bring her beloved penguin home. Joe knows working alongside her is going to be challenging, mainly because the minute she comes around his heart starts to go into overdrive, and the sparks start to fly... but he doesn't do love, relationships, or anything of the sort, or does he?

Once again this author has brought her A-game and given readers a heartwarming tale and two endearing characters that they can't help but lose their heart too. Between the pages of ""About That Kiss"" you will find two characters that don't believe in love and are adamant that they don't want to fall victim to it, but fortunately for them the love gods are looking out for them and have other plans! The moment a missing little penguin brings these two together the sparks start to fly, desire takes over and things really start to heat up, so be ready to get your blush on!! I thoroughly enjoyed this new addition to the Heartbreaker Bay series, it had this author's trademark humor, her eccentric characters, and a little suspenseful action to boot, definitely a MUST read to look for in January!!

Once upon a time a girl and a guy fell in love, but it took a while. He didn't think he was the relationship type. She was a quiet introvert who didn't open up all that easily. Then a family heirloom goes missing and the two team up to find it. So after trying to deny it, and attempting to avoid it, they finally give in and fall and it all started with a kiss. A heat scorching, heat pounding, bone-melting, world rocking kiss.

About that kiss...

>>>>My Reivew: <<<<

This past year Jill Shalvis was given the Centennial Award by RWA for the publication of her 100th novel. With each book she seems to up her game, and this one is something special. It's another fun loving, sweet-hearted, sexy as all get out romance with a little mystery thrown into to the mix and a whole lot of depth. It seems like Jill is spreading her wings and tackling some harder subjects. I wouldn't be surprised if this one gets nominated for a RITA. In my humble opinion, it was that good. This is the fifth book of the Heartbreaker Bay series and it can definitely be read as a standalone. Be forewarned, however, it's hard to stop with just one of her novels. They tend to be very addictive.

Kylie reminded me of a cross between Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy and Stephanie Plum from Janet Evanovich's series by the same name. As you read about all her attempts to disguise herself, you can't help but get an amused look on your face. Her attempts had me chuckling and shaking my head in equal measure. I'm thinking she watched one too many humorous detective shows (somehow Scooby-Doo comes to the forefront) and thought detective work was much easier than it is. She's actually very talented and artistic when it come to woodworking, which kind of runs in the family. She should definitely stick with that.

Joe reminded me a bit of Ranger of the Stephanie Plum series. He's gorgeous, has a dangerous air about him, and is all alpha male. He works for a private investigation service and Kylie makes him laugh which is something no one else seems capable of doing. To her he seems to be one big contradiction from head to toe. Badass and ready to save the world one minute, deceptively playful the next. He's got a lot of emotional baggage and his dad isn't exactly the kind of person you want to bring your friends home to. His dad suffers from PTSD and isn't the easiest person to deal with. His dad has a tendency to answer the door with a gun in his hand, and you are never quite sure whether or not he'll use it. Joe's dad's illness led to him and his sister growing up fast and hard after their mother died. At the tender age of ten he'd assumed the parental role of the family.

At first glance, Kylie and Joe seem like complete opposites, but they actually do share something in common. Each is haunted by something in their past. This is where the depth in the story comes from. Each needs to work through their feelings of guilt in order to move on, and together they do just that.

I couldn't help but give this one 5 out of 5 roses. It was a fun, witty, heart warming and emotionally moving romance. I loved watching these two fall for one another, and their chemistry was so hot I thought my e-reader would spontaneously combust. This one had a little sugar and spice and a whole lot of hot and steamy nights cause that's what good romances are made of. On the Lisarenee Romance Rating Scale, this one earned a STEAM rating--too hot for a fan, but you still have a handle on things. You should use extreme caution when reading a book with this rating in public. People may inquire as to why you looked flustered and flushed. I simply adored it.",1516665600,5
6094,552,1778,"Ive enjoyed the Heartbreak Bay series from the start, and while there were parts of About That Kiss I really enjoyed it didn't have the same humor and fun Ive come to expect from Jill Shalvis instead she opted to grab onto the romantic suspense ring that everyone seems to be grasping at these days which was disappointing.

Kylie Masters is an accomplished wood worker and enjoys her job at Reclaimed Woods with one of her late grandfathers accomplished apprentices. She has a great group of friends who live and work nearby and shes finding it hard to forget the kiss she shared with Joe Malone, who works as a private investigator in the same complex where she works. When the last thing she has to remember her beloved grandfather goes missing and she receives a ransom note of sorts, she turns to Joe for help.

First and foremost I want to say that the attraction and tension between Kylie and Joe was impossible to miss and I did enjoy watching them fluster one another. The missing penguin figurine and the photos of it in various perilous poses while troublesome to the heroine actually added a bit of humor to the book something that was mostly missing. While I appreciated that the figure and its disappearance brought them together, this part of the story overtook the romance which is one of the reasons I don't like romantic suspense. The other being a heroine who puts herself in danger necessitating rescue by the hero which surprise, surprise happens in this book and save me from heros who think they don't deserve love or want to commit until they see someone else interested in a woman that has caught his attention.

Parts of this book that kept it from being a complete miss; the crazy crew of friends that cant seem to keep their noses out of each others business and Vinnie, Kylies loveable little pup, with an aversion to doorways.

While there was enough good in About That Kiss to keep me reading; I didn't find it as endearing or entertaining as the previous books in this series.

6095,112,1778,"About That Kiss is book 5 in the Heartbreaker Bay series. I'm really loving this group of friends that the series revolves around. This novel focuses on Kylie and Joe and I found myself hooked from the first chapter. If you're wanting a Contemporary Romance series to try you have to grab this series!

Kylie Masters is a bit different from our usual leading lady, she makes custom wood pieces at Reclaimed Woods and is quite talented. She's frantic when she loses the only thing she has left from her Grandfather that raised her and turns to Joe Malone to help track down who stole it. Our duo strikes a bargain, Kylie makes Joe's sister a wood framed mirror and he'll track down the person that stole her carved penguin. Joe's the perfect guy for the job since he works with Archer at his security business. They go through their suspects but the tension between the two grows until they decide to have a fling. Neither is looking for something serious but as the novel progressed I wondered how they'd make it work. Joe has some major commitment issues and Kylie has seen her mom go from guy to guy and it's left some insecurities on her part too.

About That Kiss is a great addition to a series I adore. I enjoyed seeing their romance unfold along with the mystery. I'm hoping we see some more of the guys in the security companies as future lead characters, because I can't get enough of them! If you're a fan of Contemporary Romance with a touch of whodunit mixed in you'll love this book.",1516665600,4
6096,372,1778,"I love how every single character in the Heartbreaker Bay series has a distinct personality, with distinct fears and flaws to overcome. And each time I read about a couple, I think Jill Shalvis cant possibly top them being my favoriteand then somehow, she totally does.

Kylie and Joe are amazing together! Adorable, endearing, and so, so sweet. They both have their flaws and their idiosyncrasies, of course, but underneath all that, they're truly good people who have experienced some really bad things in their lives. They get each other, and thats what truly binds them together in ways neither one of them expected.

Joe is someone Kylie both wants and tells herself she cant have. Hes wrong for her, and yet, she cant seem to stop from wanting him. Kylie is someone Joe has wanted for a while, but deep down believes deserves better than he could ever give her. Hes tough, protective, and a has a beautiful heart and a great sense of humor. Which is a really good thing because Kylie is quite the charactertruly a larger than life heroine who I would totally befriend.

If you're looking for a dynamite contemporary romance with a charming heroine and a kick-butt hero, pick up a copy of About that Kiss by Jill Shalvis! Its a swoon-worthy romance that, if you're anything like me, will be impossible to put down.",1516665600,5

Love love loved Kylie and Joe. Shes tougher than she thinks and has the biggest heart. Hes gruff and stand off-ish. Together they have loads of chemistry and some sweet moments together. I truly enjoyed the reading them figure things out.

Plot wise, it was okay. The scavenger hunt isn't quite as whimsical as it sounds and felt a bit convoluted in parts. I loved them getting to know each other and it was interesting, but something was sort of off for me. Something kept me from loving it.

Overall, I did love Kylie and Joe together {as well as the rest of the cast} and the epilogue was adorable. It was a great addition to the series and I cant wait to see who is next.

6098,74,1778,"About that Kiss by Jill Shalvis is a 2018 Avon publication.

Sweet, sexy and suspenseful!

A mind blowing, toe curling kiss-

It was just a one off- Joe never called Kylie after they shared that kiss, so Kylie tries to put it out of her mind.

But, a special heirloom her grandfather made for her is stolen, and held for ransom- yes, you read that right, and she needs Joes expertise in getting it back.

Kylie insists on helping with the investigation, which means spending time with Joe, who is having a very hard time keeping his lips away from hers.

Joe and Kylie have an almost feverish chemistry between them. They cant keep seem to stop kissing each other! As deeper feelings begin to develop, they both try to hide or deny their emotions.

In the meantime, the case of the missing penguin remains an enigma as one lead after another, turns into a dead end. But, there is also an underlying sense of dread, as the thief becomes more insistent. Could Kylie be in danger?

I really enjoyed this installment in the Heartbreaker Bay series. The magic fountain is still bringing couples together, but his story has a bit of a suspenseful edge to it, without becoming too dark, and even has a little screwball action tossed in, which I really enjoyed.

The characters are well drawn, and of course a bit quirky, but I loved their unique occupations, and backstories, involving the secondary characters, which was a nice touch.

Both Kylie and Joe had a hard time in life, but neither of them used it as an excuse. If anything, they were both a little too hard on themselves.

What I really, really, really liked was Kylies sense of self-worth. I loved the way she refused to accept crumbs and insisted on the full buffet. You go girl! This is a such a positive message, not just for young ladies, but for guys too, especially those who are afraid they might not be good with relationships. When its right, you gotta step up and show a girl what you're made of.

As always, Shalvis weaves an emotional and sentimental story, but is offset by a lighter tone, brisk pacing, and humor.

This is a delightful contemporary romance with a very light, action and romantic suspense element included, making this one a real pleasure.

6099,551,1778,"About That Kiss quickly became one of my favorite book from Jill Shalvis. From the second I started reading I was captivated by these characters. They were both very strong lead characters that I could admire. Joe was sexy with all his alpha-ness and Kylie was just as strong, yet had a quiet vulnerability in her character that I liked.

The story takes you on their journey to find Kylie's wooden penguin that also holds the memory of her grandfather. When I first figured out what exactly Kyle was on a quest to find I did think it was a little silly but as I delved deeper into the story I came to like it. It was a little quirky for a romance book but it still gave me a good dose of suspense that kept me interested.

Overall, I found this story to be very well written and I liked the mix of a light mystery with a good amount of romance. The characters were both very likable and I already can't wait to read more from the secondary characters featured.",1516665600,4

6101,557,1778,"I absolutely adored this. About That Kiss is my favorite book in the Heartbreaker Bay series so far. I loved the main characters, the animosity between them, the humor, and the bit of mystery mixed in. This was pretty perfect to me!

I loved Joe and Kylie. They had such great chemistry and I loved how they played off one another and the humor that was created. That animosity was really playful and a bit snarky and I ate it up. I thought Joe was fantastic, all gruff and bossy but really sweet and caring. I loved learning about his past and having him let his guard down. Those moments when he opens to her were wonderful. I loved, loved, loved Kylie! She was a tough spitfire that spoke her mind and I loved that feistiness and attitude. Together they had so many great scenes with excellent back and forth banter and I enjoyed the build of them coming together immensely.

This is one of those stories that had me smiling the entire time. It's so entertaining to read and I keep having little bursts of laughter bubble out of me. Adding to that is a really well rounded cast of characters that I feel like I've come to know since the series began. I love seeing couples and people from other books and getting updates on them, it was fantastic.

The writing was great with excellent details. I loved the dual POVs and thought both Kylie and Joe had great voices. There was a really nice mystery, suspense element happening which is one of the things that brought Joe and Kylie together and I really like how everything flowed. There were also these subtle, emotional moments that I thought were perfect when one of them opened up. There a lot of small elements woven in and I kept thinking, this is just getting better and better.

This story was just so ridiculously fun to read with these great characters who where on an adventure of sorts. I loved Joe and Kylies chemistry and heat, getting to know them, the bits of drama, and the overall feel the story gave me. A must read! Reading a Jill Shalvis book always feels like coming home because I know exactly what I'm going to get.

Joe isn't the forever guy, hes the for now guy, if that, so she tries to push the attraction into a deep, dark closet. Unfortunately something comes up and she needs Joes help. So she asks him to help her find something that was stolen in exchange for her making a gift for his sisters birthday and he agrees. Now they're working together to solve a mystery and that means spending a lot of time together. Sometimes they're arguing, sometimes they're kissing, and sometimes they're thinking that maybe theyve found something worth keeping.

Overall reaction to the story? Jill Shalvis books are pure magic! Her characters wiggle their way into a permanent place in your heart and theres nothing you want to do about it! I loved being able to jump back into this stellar group of friends. The bonds between each of them are part of what makes them my favorite cast of characters. Joe and Kylie seem like an unusual pair with Joe being the playboy of the group and Kylie being a forever kind of person. I loved their verbal sparring and the way Shalvis built up their relationship from Not a Chance to No One Else Will Do with plenty of laughs along the way. I tell you, theres something really special about this group from Heartbreaker Bay, they always put a smile on my face.

Describe the hero in five words: Enigmatic. Flirty. Loyal. Cocky. Friendly.
Did you like him? Yes.
Why? Joe may be a fling kind of guy but I cant help but like him. Hes a great guy and has every quality that makes him a friend youd want to have. He just doesnt do relationships and for believable reason too. Throughout the series he has always come across as a carefree playboy but About That Kiss went beyond his food, fun, and women attitude to show a man who was riddled with guilt. He punished himself for the bad choices he made in his youth and made sure women didn't stay in his life long enough to be a threat to his self imposed emotional isolation. His internal conflict contrasted with the persona he showed to everyone else and to me made him feel more real and more of a leading man rather than just the sidekick he was in past books.

Describe the heroine in five words: Quirky. Loyal. Intelligent. Funny. Caring.
Did you like her? Yes.
Why? Like Joe, Kylie was more of a sidekick in previous books, she had a funny thing to say here, a bit of advice there but now everything in her life is laid bare and the result is yet another character to love. Kylie has such a relatable brand of crazy that made her such fun and qualities that made her stand out among her female friends, starting with her profession. Shes a woodworker! I loved that we get to see her in her element rather than just hearing her talk about it! But despite having a group of loving friends, Kylie still seemed lonely because she didn't let people see her broken side, the side that wished for someone to love her and not leave her like her parents did. Even with her vulnerabilities though she was a feisty one and didn't let Joe get away with ruffling her feathers. She was clever enough to have the last word once in awhile and throw Mr. Fun Time off balance.

Lets talk about the romance: Joe and Kylies relationship was part attraction, part competitiveness. They constantly tried to put the other off balance and that was part of the fun. They balanced out each others crazy. Joe brought a bit of calm organization and Kylie shook him out of his No Strings comfort zone. These two were hyper aware of each other long before they kissed and that tension took their chemistry up a couple of notches. What I really enjoy about Shalvis couples is that they don't just fall in love, they build a real friendship with the person they fall for and Joe and Kylie are no exception. While they got to know each other though there were plenty of laugh out loud moments that really made my day.

How about that supporting cast? Kylie and Joe both belong to the same group of friends so they weren't total strangers. I just adore this group to pieces, they're the right combination of honesty, love, support, and humor. Theyre all so different from each other yet they function as a real family, complete with crazy as heck moments that always have me wishing I had a group like them. Joes sister Molly and their dad were something else too. Molly has been around since the beginning since shes also part of the crazy group of friends but it was nice to see her and Joe have a typical sibling relationship and for them to have moments with their father that were just too funny to only read once.

Click It or Skip It? Click It. If you only read one romance this year, make it About That Kiss.

6106,648,1780,"The world is not getting closer to its end. On the contrary, it has been much improved in terms of social and cultural developments in addition to the conditions of human life in general since mankind started recording history of own. The fallacy of popular pessimistic views on the impending end of the world resulting from overpopulation, a lack of food, or any other apocalyptical reasons befitting a doomsday scenario, arises out of sheer ignorance of the nature of the human progress and/or of willful negligence of acknowledging it so as to populate epidemic scare across the globe for sensational attention and personal gains on the part of the popular authors of such doomsday scenarios.

This book by Matt Ridley is indeed a fresh breath of air that gives people of the world a beacon of truth. Ridley asserts on the grounds of rational evidence and explanation that the progress of the human race within the historical times ranging from the ancient Greek/Roman times to the modern time has been made possible by collective human intelligence by which we exchange our ideas, skills, and knowledge in the form of specialized division of labor. This social collectivism, whether tacitly or unconsciously realized by doers, apperatins to synchronicity, a kind of inter-brain entrainment in which information based on experience is exchanged between individuals, which is also known as collective phenomenon. This collective intelligence is a vital essence of cultural evolution which results from selection by imitation of successful institutions and habits. It is this element of cumulative culture that makes us singularly different from beasts. Since this social trait is innately preprogrammed in mankind, there is no inevitable end to specialization of efforts and talents that keeps this collective phenomenon going. In fact, more jobs will be produced in more specialized areas contrary to brooding premonition that technology will push out manpower from work.

In sum, Ridley aims to enlighten readers about the necessities of changes as part of cultural evolution for the betterment of mankind and the world itself. In the human history, no other time period has produced the better living conditions and cultural developments than those we have now due to a continued cumulative cultural evolution, which links to the evolution of the origins by natural selection. This book renders me a feeling that how wasteful it would be fretting about the uncertain and dark future that looks darker by popular theories of dysopic economic and social future. Just as Ridley will remain a steadfast rational optimist, I will continue to perform demands imposed upon daily tasks of life as a contribution to the orderliness and constancy of the world as m ancestors did because I know the world will not fall in calamity. as long as we as a collective body of the human race exist.",1516752000,4

6108,844,1510,"In an eerily prescient novel, Alafair Burke has given us a psychological thriller that feels more than ripped from the headlines, one that kept this reader rapidly turning pages to see what will happen next.

From the publisher:  When Angela met Jason Powell while catering a dinner party in East Hampton, she assumed their romance would be a short-lived thing, like so many relationships between locals and summer visitors. To her surprise, Jason, a brilliant economics professor at NYU, had other plans, and they married the following summer.  For Angela, the marriage turned out to be a chance to reboot her life.  She and her son were finally able to move out of her mothers home, to Manhattan, where no one knew about her tragic past.  Six years later, thanks to a bestselling book and a growing media career, Jason has become a cultural lightning rod, placing Angela near the spotlight she worked so carefully to avoid.  When a college intern makes an accusation against Jason, and another woman, Kerry Lynch, comes forward with an even more troubling allegation, their perfect life begins to unravel.  Jason insists he is innocent, and Angela believes him.  But when Kerry disappears, Angela is forced to take a closer look at the man she married.  And when she is asked to defend Jason in court, she realizes that her loyalty to her husband could unearth old secrets.

The novel opens with these provocative words:  In an instant, I became the woman they assumed Id been all along:  the wife who lied to protect her husband. And a woman who is told Youre more than a bystander. . . Dont let Jason take you and your boy down with him.  Angela had met Jason at 24, when she was a mother to a six-year-old boy, Spencer, whose legal adoption by Jason turns out to be more difficult than anticipated.  But difficulties and complications are just beginning.  It is impossible to read this book without flashing back to the headlines of the recent past.

The author, a former prosecutor who now teaches criminal law, has given the reader a page-turner of a book, one which is highly recommended.",1516752000,5
6109,120,1782,"""Trumpocracy has left Americans less safe against foreign dangers, has diverted their money from its proper purposes to improper pockets, has worked to bias law enforcement in favor of the powerful, and has sought to intimidate media lest they report things the public most needs to know."" Thus David Frum sets the stage to explain how Donald Trump undermines democracy in his new book,Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic.

If there is any surprise in this line of argument, it lies in the identity of its author. David Frum is a card-carrying conservative, or neoconservative, if you prefer the current jargon. He wrote speeches for George W. Bush and served as a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. (He is now a senior editor at The Atlantic and a CNN commentator.) What sets Frum apart from today's kneejerk ""conservatives"" is that he has been in the Never Trump camp since the New York developer turned reality TV star declared his campaign for the White House.

In Trumpocracy, Frum methodically surveys the damage Donald Trump and his minions have been inflicting on the American people ever since November 6, 2016. For example, in a chapter entitled ""Plunder,"" he details the blatant corruption that is enriching Trump and his family. (Frum notes that ""the United States ranked a not exactly reassuring eighteenth on Transparency International's corruption index, behind Hong Kong and Belgium."") But the author doesn't place all the blame on Donald Trump personally. ""The man inside the oval center did not act alone. He held his power with the connivance of others. They executed his orders and empowered his whims for crass and cowardly reasons of their own: partisanship, ambition, greed for gain, eagerness for attention, ideological zeal, careerist conformity, orin the worst casesmalicious glee in the wreck of things they could never have built themselves.""

Frum is clearly convinced (as am I) that Donald Trump is in the White House ""in some considerable part by clandestine help from Russia."" Like Guardian reporter Luke Harding in another recent book,Collusion, Frum believes the evidence clearly shows that the Trump campaign collaborated with Russian officials operating on behalf of President Vladimir Putin. And he deplores the shameless efforts by Right-Wing media as well as the White House to discredit those who are attempting to uncover the truth about the collusion. For instance, he quotes a pro-Trump author speaking on CNN: ""'There's no violation of law if, in fact, the campaign colluded with Russia, whatever that means.'"" Come again? How is collusion in this context not treasonous?

Curiously (for a conservative), Frum appears to be troubled by the near-total dominance of the Republican Party in today's political sceneand the underhanded tactics used to achieve it. ""Republicans entered the 2016 cycle controlling all elected branches of government in half the states in the country, their best showing since the 1920s. Democrats controlled only seven states, their worst showing since Reconstruction."" Frum notes with concern that voter suppression has played a major role in this trend. However, he doesn't mention gerrymandering, which has doubtless been an equally important factor.

Frum also examines the damage to US foreign policy and our country's reputation around the world. He writes, ""[Trump] never understood that America's power arose not only from its own wealth and its own military force, but from its centrality to a network of friends and allies."" The author is also deeply concerned about the multiple attacks from Trump and his staff on the national security agencies. He fears the possibility that the FBI, the CIA, and the other intelligence agenciesas well as the Pentagonmay drift into the habit of keeping future Presidents isolated and acting essentially on their own.

As other commentators have done, Frum explores the rise in support for violent white-nationalist groups as a result of Donald Trump's campaign and his time in the White House. But of even greater concern is the much broader trend toward the politics of resentment. ""The phrase 'white privilege' transitioned from the academy into common speech in the Obama yearsat exactly the moment that millions of white Americans were experiencing the worst social trauma since the Great Depression."" Not only did Trump capitalize on that development; as well all know, he is driving the wedge even deeper between whites and people of color.

There is little in Trumpocracy that is truly new. We've learned most of these lessons from others over the past two years. Frum's contribution is to compile the facts and the analysis into one thin volumeand carefully document every assertion. By contrast with other recent books about the Trump Era, one-quarter of Frum's book consists of notes. The result is a case against Donald Trump that is difficult to refute.",1516752000,5

6113,464,1778,"Kylie is the singleton (and decidedly so) in our little group of friends. Shes gone the opposite route of her mother  avoiding romantic entanglements as she struggles with a massive childhood-long crush on her boss, and missing her beloved grandfather.  Shes poured all of her love into Vinnie  a little mixed breed, totally clumsy dog who once ran into a glass door, and now tests every doorway he meets with an upraised paw. A bit more than unconventional, wood shavings and sawdust are never far from her  and while she is truly happy for her friends in love  shes decided shell never have that feeling or security because no one will want her enough.  Plenty of emotional trauma  she feels not enough after her mother dumping her with her grandfather, and his death in a fire in the workshop she grew up in.

Joe was a kid who grew up too fast and had to take on the responsibility of feeding and housing his father and sister after his mothers death. His father is suffering from extreme PTSD  and as a kid Joe did everything to keep them fed and his little sister Molly safe. When everything went pear shaped  he had two choices: military or jail. The military brought Joe some control of his temper  and he was a very good soldier  now working as the number two man in Archers security company  hes a point man on most of the difficult assignments, and completely able to keep his mind on his job.  But his sisters injuries are riding him hard  his guilt over that, and the worries that anyone close to him is in danger keeps him at arms length from anything real with a woman.  Until Kylie. When after a kiss  he cant get her out of his mind.

With Mollys birthday coming up, and her wanting a mirror that Kylie made  Joe agrees to help Kylie find a token, the only piece of her grandfather she has left, now being held for ransom  ransom paid with her authentication of a formerly lost piece from her famous grandfather and a lower-quality piece of work  both set to be sold at auction in a few weeks.

Oh these two are so stubborn  Joe has never met anyone more determined, more headstrong or even more intrusive in his work or life. He cant stop thinking about her, and trying to protect her  even when she refuses to follow instructions or let him quietly find the little penguin carving and the miscreant who stole it.  Hes intrigued and entranced by her: her look, her humor  even the crazy wigs she drags out for disguises  and she asks questions that hit right at his heart  questions hes not always ready to answer.  The two are so closed off and busy denying the connection between them  they are pieces that fit together  the last in the puzzle that is their lives  and it takes almost losing one another and strong words from Joes team-members and sister, as well as careful and considered levels of fear of the women in this little Cow Town community of friends and manufactured family that has them finally finding the truth.  Again, Shalvis has led us to yet another connection brought together by proximity and circumstance, tempered with friends, family and love, and perhaps a bit of magic from the fountain.  I love this series and story  while the other couples are making small cameo appearances and moments that show support  this book fits perfectly into the series and gives us yet another couple in this building full of people  once strangers, now family.

6114,862,1778,"Aaaah, I liked this one so much. Joe comes across as a bad ass and the strong silent type, and he is both of those but there's more to him. Kylie is quiet, determined, and hesitant when it comes to romance. Together, they have fun and let down their walls to let each other, and other people, inside.

 This book works fine as a stand alone so you can jump into the series here if you want, or start at the beginning and follow everybody's journeys. Joe and Kylie were minor characters in those books so you won't miss much of their romantic journey if you start here.

Joe and Kylie shared a spectacular, amazing, kiss recently but that was it. Neither one followed up afterwards, instead continuing on their separate paths. Then several things happen. Joe wants to purchase a mirror hand made by Kylie for his sister's birthday, and Kylie needs investigative help when a treasured carving made by late grandfather is stolen. Joe takes the case in exchange for the mirror. But there's a catch - Kylie insists on being an active participant in the investigation. Joe reluctantly agrees but several times he tries to cut her out and leave her behind, which pisses off Kylie. Kylie stands her ground and calls Joe on his behavior. She doesn't want or need his protection. She does need to be part of the search for the carving which has deep sentimental value for her - it was carved for her by her grandfather shortly before his death.

Both Joe and Kylie are carrying around guilt for events that happened in their past, actions they believed that they were responsible for. With help from Joe's sister Molly, and from each other, as well as an outside party, they come to understand where their responsibility for those actions ends. They realized they were taking on unnecessary guilt and managed to let it go. It was nice to see them come to terms with their pasts and how they were able to help each other. Joe, especially, realized that he needed to stop carrying the world on his shoulders and let other people have responsibility and own their actions, as well as letting others find their own way without him rushing in to save the day. He's been closed off emotionally for so long in some respects and yet in others he's very much a caretaker. He looks after his sister, though she doesn't want or need it, and he looks after their father, who does need some assistance. Even so, he doesn't let them all the way in but keeps them at bay.

  But she'd meant what she'd said. She didn't think she had the ability to hurt Joe. He held too much of himself back for that.

Kylie was raised mostly by her grandfather as her parents were teens when she born and her father took off, abandoning them, and her mother, though well-intentioned, was flighty. In fact, Kylie and her mother reversed roles with Kylie being the mature caretaker of the pair. But they come to understand each other a little better and near the end of the story, when it matters, her mother is there for her.

I liked the mix of romance and mystery in ""About That Kiss"". It's not a romantic suspense but the mystery is fairly important to the story. I was sure I knew who the guilty party but I was wrong. I do wish that Shalvis had given us more in the way of clues as to the perpetrator's identity, but otherwise I enjoyed that story line. Also, Tina needs her own romance and HEA. I hope Shalvis is working on it.

""About That Kiss"" was sweet, fun, emotional, and steamy. It's an excellent addition to the Heartbreaker Bay series.

Some favorite quotes:

  She blinked. She could tell he'd carved it himself, but beyond that she had no guesses. ""Did you make a ..."" She turned it around in her palm but it looked like only one thing. ""A penis?""

  He paused to stare at the carving and then laughed. ""Okay, yeah. Let's go with that."" He waggled a brow. ""For when I can't be with you. Beware of splinters.""

  She didn't bother hiding her emotions like he did. She had no interest in keeping herself in control. And actually, her willingness to let go was one of the things he loved about her. There was just something appealing about how she put herself out there, no worrying about outcome or the possibility of getting hurt.

  ""Well, no matter what happens, pizza will always be there for you,"" Tina said. ""Through thick and thin, in crust we trust.""

  ""And it's not like he isn't really hot,"" Haley said. ""What?"" she asked when they all just stared at her. ""I'm gay. I'm not dead.""

  Molly grimaced and put her fingers in her ears. ""Guys, please. He's my brother.""

6115,277,1778,"About that Kiss by Jill Shalvis is the 5th book in her wonderful Heartbreaker Bay series. Having read all the books in this series, I looked forward to reading this one, and once again Jill Shalvis gives us another winner.

Kylie, our heroine, is a woodworker, having been trained by her now deceased grandfather to create beautiful wood work designs.  While working in the store, she sees Joe (our hero) come in; Joe is another member of Archers Security firm, and they all share the same friends, though Joe and Kylie really do not get along.  During an engagement party not too long ago, Joe and Kylie had a bit too much to drink, and they had a powerful sizzling kiss.  But since then, she has not heard from him, until he came to the store.  Joe wants to buy a mirror that Kylie created for his sisters birthday, but it was already promised to someone else and Kylie, giving him the cold shoulder, tells him that she does not have time to do another.

When Kylie goes home that night, she finds an envelope under her door; with a picture of a treasured wood penguin that her grandfather had given her. Kylie knows that someone has stolen this from her, but she has no idea why, only that she wants it back desperately, as it is the only thing she has of her grandfather.  She decides to go to Joe, to help her find it, and promises payment in the form a new mirror for Molly, his sister.  Joe reluctantly accepts, but is surprised when Kylie insists to go with him as they investigate the possible culprits.

Kylie and Joe both have their own issues, with neither wanting to become involved. Both of them blame themselves for putting loved ones in danger; Kylie for her grandfather, who died in a fire; Joe, saving his sister from a gang he was involved with when he was younger. They are both scorching together, as their romance does heat up, as they spend more time together.  But they are also both stubborn and independent.

What follows is a sweet romance, as well as a very good mystery as to who is threatening Kylie.  There are some twists and surprises along the way that will change things for both of them.  What makes this even better, are their friends, whom we have come to love over the previous 4 books.  I also adored Kylies dog .  Cute.

Joe and Kylie were a great couple, very hot together; lots of fun to watch them falling hard for each other.  As I have said before, Heartbreaker Bay is a great series to enjoy, and I suggest you start with the first book.  About That Kiss was a fun, at times exciting, sexy, enjoyable read  with an outstanding cast of characters, cute dog, and a bit of mystery.

I did not like any of the characters, including the two little girls. I don't like the way Grace treats her friend, and their search for God was just weird. The whole reference to sheep and goats...also weird.

The adults were all loathsome. The disappearance of Mrs. Creasy unexciting. It went on for so long with no progress that 70% into the book I just skimmed through the rest of it, found out what happened in the end (which was super disappointing and anticlimactic) and put the book down, once and for all.

6119,559,1432,"The Pioneer Woman Cooks Dinnertime is by Ree Drummond.  If I had to describe this cookbook in one word, I think it would have to be delightful.  This is not just a cookbook, it is so much more!

The cover of the book claims that it includes comfort classics, freezer food, 16-minute meals, and other delicious ways to solve supper.  But there is a lot more to this book.  It starts out with an introduction and a peek at a typical week in Ree Drummonds life.  Ree lives on a real, working ranch.  This is one busy woman!  Throughout the cookbook, there are photos included of Ree and her family around the ranch.  I loved these.  Yes, there are awesome recipes in this book but she also made me just want to sit down with it and thumb through it looking at all of the pictures and reading her little anecdotes.

I came across one of The Pioneer Womans recipes online for baked beans.  I made it for a get together and am now asked to bring my baked beans every time any of our family gets together.  So I asked for one of her cookbooks for Christmas.  All of the recipes include easy to come by ingredients.  No weird or unusual ingredients.  For me this is important.  Although I don't live on a ranch, I do live in the country so I cant just run down the street to a grocery store.

The few recipes I have tried so far have all been a complete success.  Im old enough to feel confident if I want to change something small to fit our likes but I love having the book for so many new and wonderful ideas to try.  Each recipe includes not only an ingredient list but step by step photos along with instructions.  What a lot of work must have gone into taking all the photos for each recipe.

Ree also likes to cook ahead and throughout the book are so many ways to do that.  She will teach you how to make up a whole bunch of meatballs to be frozen and used for different things.  There are also plenty of helpful hints like simmering some barbecue sauce on the stove with chopped garlic to use.  Wow did this taste good!

I look forward to so many more recipes in this book that I want to try and also, I hope to pick up some of her other cookbooks as well.  Even in this age of digital books, I like to have a real, hard copy cookbook to sit on the counter while following a recipe.

6120,609,1001,"As I write this review I am reeling with sadness over the death of Ursula K.Le Guin, a writer of such imagination and such wisdom  rarely seen these days.  The news has inspired me to write a review of this, my favorite of her novels. The Lathe of Heaven was originally published in 1971, and it remains as fresh and amazing today as it did nearly fifty years ago.

George Orr is a nondescript young man leading an inconspicuous life in Portland, Oregon.  Life is grim: the world is severely overpopulated, with constant warfare, growing food shortages, and a climate that is gradually growing less and less hospitable to humanity.  Like most of his fellows George copes with the discomfort of every day life by using narcotics which blot out some of the worst aspects of his existence.  But George has a secret: he has effective dreams that can change reality, a power so disturbing to him that he regularly overdoses himself to the point of near-death. After one such episode he is assigned to a dream specialist or oneirologist, Dr. Haber, for help.  When Dr. Haber realizes the potential of George's effective dreams he begins to use the ""gift,"" as he sees it, to reshape the world.  Unfortunately Haber discovers, as do all who are so certain that they have all the answers to solve everyone else's problems, that reshaping the world carries penalties for the shaper as well as those who are reshaped.

Le Guin's beautiful, dreamlike prose makes The Lathe of Heaven into a marvelous reading experience.  I've spent many happy hours with George Orr over the years, and from now on I will spend them not only with him but with the memory of his creator.",1516752000,5

She drinks to forget and to soften the edges of her painful, lonely existence. Ten months she has lived alone, terrified to leave what should be her dream home. She exists on a cocktail of medication, which she either forgets to take or overdoses on, so when Anna sees something shocking,  though the neighbour's  window she is not a reliable witness.
Everything is seen through Anna's eyes but is what she sees, part of her delusional state or something sinister? I like Anna and feel a connection with her. Is she a victim of paranoia, or a conspiracy? Or does the truth lie somewhere in between?
 Perfect pacing means that even where there are lots of details and drunken confusion, these don't hinder the story but inform the reader. Although, given the unreliableness of the narrator, not everything you discover is true.
The characters are vivid, as is the setting and the suspense building is cleverly done. The atmosphere moves from mundane to terrifying seamlessly and has more impact because of this. The plot is twisty and the shocks when they come, alter facts you were sure of, making it essential to turn the page and see what happens next.
Anna's condition is treated sensitively, Sharing poignant memories and longings with the reader, which keep her character and the story believable.
A worthwhile read, some of the twists you may guess, but there are some you won't. The ending brings the suspense to a crashing crescendo as the mystery is solved and Anna has to decide whether she wants to live or die. Reading these scenes is like watching a film, just like the black and white thrillers Anna loves.

What makes this book somewhat different than what one might expect is the rotating viewpoints, following the mom (of course) but also the lead male detective. What is unique about the detective is that his whole story is told in bits and pieces in flashbacks, as he reluctantly unburdens himself to a psychotherapist, mandated by his bosses after the case is over due to his debilitating insomnia and depression. In addition to the two viewpoints, the author also tosses in the ubiquitous and often vicious impact of social media, with anonymous blogs and FB posts making life, and solving the crime, even more difficult.

This novel is definitely a quick page-turner, and one gets caught up in some of the dead-end suspects until the real culprit is unveiled. The title is a bit of a head-scratcher, though, since the she would seem to be the mom, and what she knew doesnt really represent the gist of the story. Also, as a police procedural of sorts, the detectives spend a lot of time in meetings and being shouted at, but not actually doing much of anything to solve the case. They are not bumbling fools, but they do seem to waste a lot of time and energy in a dire situation where every minute counts. Their inter-personal relationships are the weakest part of the story, and the strangely abusive family narrative shared in a therapy session is just tossed in with no resolution at all.

This is a pretty decent read, with some heartfelt emotion, especially from the moms point-of-view. Just don't dig too deeply looking for more depth or logic than is actually developed.",1516752000,4
6125,764,244,"I enjoyed this book very much for its beautiful writing, blending past and present without warning, but always making sense.

As for what it was about, it seemed to be about several things.  There were themes relating to repressed love, and to a man compulsively loyal to his work and unable to live a life of his own.  The most interesting was the question as to whether it was acceptable for a small group of wealthy elite men, hosted by the butler's employer, and presuming ""superior judgment,"" to influence affairs of state through private meetings outside the boundaries of government--affecting such things as England's relationship with Germany prior to World War 2.

6128,402,669,"Toward the end of December, I finally picked up and completed reading The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. This was a first time read for me and, despite knowing the outcome of the story, I can admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I also love how far it delves into the duality of man.

Dr. Jekyll deals with the same dilemma we all do: theres a darker nature buried within him. This story follows his pursuit of a cure  a way to return him to a wholesome, innocent, good man. Of course, we all know what happens when we try to play the role of a god, and this story is no different.

Stevensons pacing is pretty even, which Im grateful for. I didn't find the story to difficult to comprehend and I feel that there are some very good points brought up in it. Considering I did not get the chance to study it in high school, I feel as if I missed out on some valuable literature. I would probably read this again.",1516838400,4
6129,1075,758,"I read The Little Prince to satisfy one of the advanced prompts for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge (a book tied to your ancestryhaving a last name that is French, it seemed only fitting to read the all-time best-selling book by a French author)

It was a short, sweet story, reminiscent in ways of The Alchemist. A man stranded in the desert after a plane crash encounters a young prince from another world and has his life and outlook drastically changed in the process.

Very allegorical with a great depth of hidden meaning, it was an interesting read. However, it did feel similar to other books Ive read, mining the same philosophical veins, so to speak. Even though it was published before the other books, the fact that I am only reading it now (after them) has probably somewhat diminished its rating.

I think a lot of people will enjoy this book: children who are tired of explaining life to adults, and adults who have forgotten they were once children seem to be ideal targets. For me, at this point in my reading life, it is simply revisiting previously explored territory and finding nothing new or remarkable.

6130,256,375,"A friend of mine once said: ""Some books you judge; other books judge you."" It is with a positive bias that most lovers of literature pick up the monuments of the Western canon: _Don Quixote_, _War and Peace_, _The Brothers Karamazov_, _Moby Dick_, _Les Misrables_, _Middlemarch_. When reading any of these immortal works, I may be led to think that there's something wrong with me, not with the book, if I do not enjoy it; this is what is meant by the book judging the reader. _Middlemarch_ (1871-1872) is one of these ""judging books"". One may not like it, as one may not like _War and Peace_ (""what's all this philosophizing doing here?""), _Moby Dick_ (""is this a novel or an essay on whaling?""), or _Don Quixote_ (""what do these novellas within the novel have to do with the plot?""), but if one fails to recognize its greatness, that's one's own fault. Here's my confession: it was only when I finished reading _Middlemarch_ that I realized I had just read one of the best novels ever written, and yes, perhaps the best novel ever written in English, as many people describe it.

The first thing that will strike the reader about _Middlemarch_ is that it does not have a single protagonist. Sure, Dorothea Brooke is a central figure (so is Natasha Rostova in _War and Peace_), and the novel opens and closes with her, but to call her the protagonist would be to diminish the importance of many other key characters, such as Tertius Lydgate, Rosamond Vincy, and Will Ladislaw. The novel is subtitled ""A Study of Provincial Life,"" and that is exactly what it is. The protagonist, then, is Middlemarch, the town itself. The novel is an x-ray of life in a provincial English town in the early nineteenth century. More universally, it is a depiction of human discontent brought about by (1) misguided choices and (2) negative attitudes.

Not much can be said about the characters without spoiling the plot. A romantic young woman marries an older, more serious man. A rather austere, idealistic young man marries a woman of his age who is used to luxury and worries too much about appearances. An idle, lazy young man is not good at keeping his money; another one has artistic inclinations, and has trouble finding his place in the world. _Middlemarch_ is, as my title for this review indicates, a tale of mismatched people and missed opportunities. As you read the novel, you'll find yourself thinking, ""If only X had married Z instead of Y...."" But one should focus on the motives that lead to the choices, and these motives speak volumes about the society of that time and place.

That said, _Middlemarch_ is ultimately not bleak. The novel is realism at its best, and while it may be conservative in content when compared to, say, _Madame Bovary_ (1856) or _Anna Karenina_ (1873-1877), George Eliot's novel is more formally experimental than those, and represents a realist tradition that had not yet become tainted with the excessive pessimism characteristic of the naturalist movement. _Anna Karenina_ presents three marriages: a disastrous one, a reasonably tolerable one, and a good one. _Middlemarch_ is less formulaic and allows for more nuances when it comes to human relationships. Tolstoy may be a more satisfying narrator, but when it comes to dissecting souls, Eliot has the keen eye and the precision of Jane Austen. It is in fact Austen's tradition that Eliot continues, a tradition that would later be carried on by Henry James and John Galsworthy, among others. I like to think that it was this tradition that the Swedish Academy was recognizing when it awarded the Nobel Prize to Galsworthy, mainly for _The Forsyte Saga_ (see my review).

Why is _Middlemarch_ considered to be the best English novel ever written? Usually, when critics (or whoever it is that makes this type of decisions) look for The Great [insert demonym] Novel, they look to the nineteenth century, the age of the so-called ""national novels"". Given that time span, _Middlemarch_ competes, basically, with the novels of Jane Austen, the novels of Charles Dickens, and _Jane Eyre_. (_Wuthering Heights_ is well written too, and engrossing, but no nation would choose as its representative a work that portrays such neurotic characters.) Against the works of Austen and _Jane Eyre_, _Middlemarch_ would win because of its larger social scope: it is a panoramic novel. Dickens' works may be said to be panoramic too, but Eliot's prose is more polished than that of Dickens, and _Middlemarch_ is not marred by the structural and plot deficiencies that one finds in most of Dickens' works (let me mention, for instance, the unrealistic role that serendipity plays in _Oliver Twist_). I love Austen, and Dickens, and the Bronts. In fact, I enjoyed reading their works much more than I enjoyed reading _Middlemarch_; I'm just offering my thoughts on the coronation of Eliot's great novel.

It is needless to say that _Middlemarch_ displays an amazing understanding of women that is beyond the power of a male writer. (Here's a great line from the novel apropos of this: ""Men know best about everything, except what women know better."") What is amazing about Eliot is how well she understands not only the plights of women, but also those of men. As an example, let me cite the character of Will Ladislaw, who feels more than any other male character the pressure of a society in which a man must ""become someone"" or face ridicule and isolation.

As I said above, I had trouble with _Middlemarch_ initially. I kept comparing it to _Anna Karenina_ and to the works of Dickens. I wanted more action, more scandalous content, more colorful characters. When I reached the second half of the novel, however, I began to read compulsively, eager to know whether the characters would manage to find happiness after all. Give _Middlemarch_ a chance. It may take a while for some to connect with it, but once they do, they'll be thankful for investing their time in this great novel.

My next Victorian novel will be _Bleak House_ (1852-53), by Charles Dickens.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy the book!",1516838400,5

6133,142,282,"Initial Thoughts

After loving P.S. I Like You and hating The Fill-In Boyfriend, I wasn't sure how to feel going into this book. Would it be adorable and cute or frustrating and cringey?
It turned out to be a bit of both.

What I Liked

Dax. Dax was honestly a pretty compelling character, and turned out to be my favorite character in the story. He was independent and closed off, yet he had this soft gooey center that made me want to love him. At first I was a little confused by his motivations, but as the story went on and I began to understand him better, he really grew on me. Also, he ACTUALLY READ in the library (unlike the other characters, which kind of made the whole plot questionable... but I'll talk more about that later).
The relationship between Dax and Autumn was pretty cute. It definitely followed the hurt-closed-off-guy-opens-up-to-spoilt-rich-girl-who-secretly-has-problems trope, but it was done pretty well. I really liked how organic the relationship seemed (even if the part where them getting stuck in the library was... um... unlikely?)
I also liked the pacing of the book. It wasn't too slow, but it wasn't super fast either. And the plot was not too complex, but had a lot of complexity to it.

What I Didn't Like

Jeff. He was the boy that Autumn was pining over, and honestly he didn't do much except annoy me. Even though he was made out to be a fun, likeable, and go-lucky kind of guy, I couldn't bring myself to care about him in the slightest. He felt too much like a cut-out, and it definitely didn't help that his ""best friend"" was literally an exact copy of him (except of course he didn't like Autumn).
I honestly didn't really like any of the characters except Dax. All of Autumn's friends were boring, and I couldn't even differentiate between them. And, at some point, there was a little bit of drama when one of the friends told Autumn that another one liked Jeff... and then it was never mentioned again. Like what was the point of that?!?
I really didn't like the parents in this book. They were all frustrating and pointless. Even Dax's mom, who was built up so much, was a complete letdown. Then there were some loose ends left with her. DID THEY MAKE UP? DID DAX TELL HER OFF? The world may never know.
Also can we take a minute and talk about the library. What the hell. First of all, the whole Autumn being left behind thing was stupid and improbable. I just can't see that happening in real life. Secondly, the very first thing I would think of in that situation would be pulling the fire alarm. It was SO FRUSTRATING waiting for Autumn to come up with that on her own. It kind of ruined the whole first part of the book for me.
And Dax was honestly kind of annoying about the whole fire alarm thing. Like just let the girl get out and hide if you don't want to be seen. It's not like they are going to search the library once they realize that she pulled the alarm because she was stuck in there.
And then the whole plot when she finally got out of the library. I mean, I guess I could see how that would happen, but it was all just a little much to believe.
And then Jeff's mom. Oh MY GOSH she was the worst. I actually kind of wanted to strangle her. I get that she was just clinging onto any hope, but it was so unrealistic and annoying.
Let's also take a minute to talk about Autumn's anxiety disorder. She kept it a secret from her friends because she didn't want them to look at her differently. UMMMMM. Honey. If you are scared to tell your ""best"" friend(s) something like that then are you sure that they are really your friends? I get that talking about stuff like that can be scary sometimes, but that's something that people talk about with their friends. You should see how much I talk to my friends about stuff like that. It's called building a support system.
It wasn't even that I had the hardest time believing that she would keep it from her friends (although it was pretty stupid), what really annoyed me about Autumn's anxiety was how much she whined about it. That was literally half the book. ""Oh my gosh my anxiety is so bad and it holds me back from life but I don't want help I just want to suffer in silence please and make my friends think I'm a terrible flake instead of facing my problems. But you know I'm gonna whine about it 24/7 and wonder why this is happening to ME. I'm also going to ignore my parents and brother trying to help me because they JUST DON'T understand my mind.""

Overall

As you can probably tell by the amount of good vs. bad things I had to say about By Your Side, this wasn't my favorite book. It wasn't the worst thing that I've ever read, but I don't think I'm going to be picking up anything by Kasie West for quite a while.

6136,15,819,"Anna has problems. It's been nearly a year since she left her house. Not as hard these days with so many things being bought online and delivered to your door. Obviously there are things that she does need to go outside and do, putting the rubbish out for one, but for these, she has a lodger.
So, what does a person do all day if she can't go out. Yes, that's right, she spies on her neighbours. Making up names and backstories where she does not know the truth and keeping careful watch of what they all get up to on a daily basis. She's not casual about it by any means. In fact you could consider her dedication to her watching, even dipping into the realm of voyeurism on occasion.
And then, one day, she hears a scream coming from the Russell's house, and she sees what she thinks could be a rather nasty crime. But looks can be deceiving, especially if the watcher isn't exactly sober at the time, which is basically the police's attitude to the whole thing, backed up by the rest of the members of the household. Did Anna really see what she thought she saw and, if so, why are the Russell's lying?
Basically, this book is a updated re-imagining of the wonderful Rear Window. A well loved Hitchcock film based on a short story. But there are as many similarities as there are differences, especially with the plot and here, this book really excels. As with the majority of this genre of book, we have all the usual key plot elements front and centre. Secrets, lies, duplicitous behaviour, assumption, unreliability, mental health issues, you name it, it's here. But, never does the book come across as ""psychological thriller by numbers"" each element warrants inclusion and is seamlessly injected into the plot perfectly.
To say that Anna is a bit of a complex character would be the understatement of the year. Wow, she really has got herself into a bit of a pickle, even before seeing what she believes she saw. From the start, we know there is something that triggered all this off. Brought it to a head so to speak but it is not until much later that we found out what. And my heart bled as I read on with tears in my eyes. OK, I get a bit emotionally involved with well described, believable, wounded characters.
The atmosphere described by the author was suspenseful, indeed claustrophobic at times, especially as Anna's paranoia started to escalate. There were a few occasions where the action was physical but, what with Anna not being so mobile, these were few compared with the cerebral level of intrigue the author wove throughout. It was also quite a visual book for me, unusually so, and I also think it would transfer to screen very well (but please don't kill it).
All in all, a cracking book which looks to be a debut - surely not! One which grabbed me from the first page, held me captive throughout, leaving me spent but satisfied at the end. I really can't wait to see what the author serves up next time.
My thanks go to the Publisher and Netgalley for the chance to read this book.",1516838400,5
6137,681,1778,"Okay, About That Kiss is a cute story about two stubborn people. Yes, Joe and Kylie are extremely stubborn, no ifs ands or buts about that. However, they have this amazing chemistry that both are trying to keep at bay. Lets be honest, they can't keep their hands off each. Plus, they are up each others grills throughout the book.

Basically, Kylie needs Joe's help in finding this precious item, because no one else will help her. In some ways they have a madcap adventure. Poor Joe, all he wants to do is keep Kylie safe, and keep her at a distance. Kylie's not very good at that. She's not very good at listening. It's pretty crazy throughout the story, and they drive one another bonkers. Yet, they fit well together.

Joe is pretty awesome throughout the story. He puts up with a lot, but he slowly starts to melt his stoic exterior. Kylie, is definitely stubborn and keeps Joe on his toes. Yes, these two are pretty fun to read. There were times I felt for Joe, and I just wanted to strap Kylie in safe place. That girl can be a loose cannon at times, and it does get a little hairy towards the end. However, Joe and Kylie seem to find their footing after a few missteps. So, if you are in need of a madcap adventure that is light and fun, you might try About That Kiss. Don't worry if you haven't read the previous books, this book focuses on Joe and Kylie, but also makes me wonder who the next couple would be. I kind hope it's Joe's sister, because that would be soooo much fun. He's a bit overprotective of her.

6139,187,819,"The author, A. J. Finn, has weaved a Alfred Hitchcockian type tale that reminds me of the 1954 movie, Rear Window, but is distinctly different. In Finns novel we have a 39 year old child psychologist, Anna, who has agoraphobia (in her case-a fear of being outside) and who witnesses a murder from her window...or did she? Can a witness be reliable if she is on a diet of merlot wine and numerous self-prescribed pills? Basically, she is a mental mess after a recent horrible car accident. She is also freshly separated from her husband, Ed and her daughter, Olivia. She is a recluse who sleeps late, talks to her family (who aren't there), communicates on the internet site, Agora, with others that have her phobia and then watches old black and white movies all night...mostly mysteries. Oh yea, she also spies on her neighbors with her Nikon D5500 camera. The author got my attention immediately with excellent prose (with a touch of ergodic literature thrown in) that kept me guessing throughout the 427 pages. The only minor flaw was the authors repetitive time spent writing about Annas addictions to pills and merlot wine. But like I said that was minor compared to the constant drama and tension that built up as I read each short (which Im a big fan of) cliffhanging chapter. I did try to figure out the ending, but with so many surprises along with the many twist and turns, I failed to solve this gripping whodunit because I was never sure a murder even happened.

Anna lives in a four story multi-million dollar home in NYC with her cat, Punch and a basement tenant, David. The story starts out with Anna spying on her neighbors across the street in #212. She sees Dr. Miller almost catch his wife in bed with their contractor. While she is having a discussion with her daughter and husband (who aren't there), she sees new neighbors moving into #207 across the park. The deed of sale posted yesterday. My new neighbors are Alistair and Jane Russell (and their teenage son, Ethan); they paid $3.45 million for their humble abode. Google tells me that hes a partner at a midsize consultancy, previously based in Boston. Shes untraceable-you try plugging Jane Russell into a search engine. During the day, Anna logs on to the internet site, Agora, with the code name of thedoctorisin. She tries to help various people that have agoraphobic fears similar to hers, which""includes being outside the home alone; being in a crowd, or standing in a line; being on a bridge. One of the newcomers emailed her. Anna directs her to a survival manual she whipped up in the spring. It explains how to get food and  medicine without leaving the house, et cetera. The doorbell rings...its the Russells boy, Ethan. He gives Anna a gift of a lavender candle from his mother. Ethan seems to be a shy boy. He ask where her family is. Anna tells him that Ed and Olivia don't live with her, Were separated. She tells him that she is a psychologist who works with children. He leaves. Is he as delicate as he appears?

On Halloween, Since Anna doesnt answer the door for trick or treaters, her house is egged. The kids will not stop. I jolt the door open. Light and air blast me. She is hit with eggs and falls, I taste concrete. I Taste blood. I feel my limbs pinwheeled on the ground. The ground ripples against my body. My body ripples against the air. Suddenly someone chases the kids away and helps Anna back into the house. Anna looks at the woman and says, Youre Jane Russell. She stops, looking at me in wonder, then laughs, her teeth glinting in the half-light. How did you know that? Several days later, Anna has her camera on the Russells house""then the doorbell rings. Its jane Russell, You must be bored as hell, she says when I open the door. Then she folds me into a hug. I laugh, nervously. Sick of all those black and white movies, I bet. I brought something for you. She smiles, dipping a hand into her bag. Its cold, too. A sweaty bottle of Riesling. My mouth waters. Its been ages since I drank white. Oh, you shouldnt They drink and play chess for two and a half hours before Jane leaves and says, Ive got very important things to do. What is so important? The next day, after Anna finishes playing chess on the internet and was deciding on what Hitchcock movie to watch, she hears from #207, A scream, raw and horrorstruck, torn from the throat. Okay, I hope I was able to arouse your interest. I just wanted to give you the flavor of whats ahead. There is no way you can anticipate what happens in the next 312 pages.

6145,1077,988,"Caroline England's ""Beneath the Skin"" is like a daytime soap opera which you forcible deny that you like, but nevertheless turn it on religiously every day. After reading the first forty pages, I put it down and thought to myself do I really want to pick up this book up again? An hour later, I read another forty pages, put it down and thought to myself do I really want to read this book? An hour later, I once again, picked it up and read the entire book in one sitting.

Ms England cleverly connects four married couples to each other, either through school, work, dinner parties, or childhood friendships. The characters are literally laden with doubts, secrets, denials, and lies.

Ms. England's writing is clear, and crisp, not overly descriptive, but just descriptive enough. Her ability to keep your attention and interest in so many characters is quite a feat, especially since the four couples are in a sense all main characters, with lesser characters thrown in... But even the lesser characters, the children, barmaid, mothers and fathers are fully developed and also quite interesting.

The writer is quite adept at creating suspense and there are a number of turns and twists in this book that are seriously unexpected but add so much to the story.

The one thing I would suggest to the author is the need to add more humor because even under the most intense situations humor plays a very important role.

I did not know at the time where the story with her father was going to go.  I had a great bond with my father and he passed away while I was still young.  So, the story between America and her father really touched me in a way it may have not others who read this one.

6151,939,15,"Are You My Mother? is a cute picture book about a bird who hatches to find that his mother is not there. He goes on a journey to find where his mother is and meets a lot of different creatures along the way.

The book is very well written. It uses easy to read language to tell a beautiful story. The cadence of the words is well timed without resorting to rhymes. The drawings are simple and beautiful, allowing the child to focus on the objects that the words are referring to. My favorite (and I imagine other's as well) is when he finds the ""snort."" It is funny and the language just has a hilarious rhythmic flow to it.

This is part of the early reader series for good reason. There is a lot of repetition in the language, once the child learns the word dog they will get to practice it over the subsequent pages. It is also a good book for tacting if you are working with young children, or children with language delays.",1516838400,5

Blame it on my love for Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Arya, Daenerys and her dragons, but Im pretty sure this has to be my new favorite ASOIAF book. I admit I don't exactly remember my feelings for the first few books, mostly because its been quite some time since Ive finished them.

But than I heard it was a realistic fiction book, which I tend to stay away from realistic book. Because I just want to read about fiction worlds and step away from the real world issues in books from time too time. But I've been hearing great things about Monster on the Litsy app, that I was going to check it out from the library at first. But than when I was staying at my parents house recovery from my Achilles Heel surgery, I was looking through my little sister book shelf and I saw she had the book Monster. So I started too read it right away. Now Monster is a quick pace read, I read it in one setting, but it was not one of my favorite books that I read this year. Don't get me wrong it is a really good book, and it's great for educations use for students in school which I think kids and students should absolutely read this book. But like I said I don't normally read realistic book quite often. Monster is actually the first realistic book that I have read, and it most definitely won't be my last I would love too read my books like Monster in the near future. Now I don't want too go into any details about Monster, because I think every readers knows what it is about. But I will say I did highly liked and enjoyed it so much, it was totally a refreshing and very important read as well. And has open my eyes wide open to the reality of what's happening in the world today.

Andover and the elderly Mrs Ascher; Bexhill and a young Miss Betty Barnard and Churston and a gentleman by the name of Sir Carmichael Clarke had all met untimely deaths at the hands of a maniac who would leave the ABC Railway guide near to or on the body, showing each destination as proof he was once again bettering the police, but especially M. Poirot. With Scotland Yard involved, plus Poirot and Hastings  surely they would get to the bottom of the dastardly murders before D arrived.

The ABC Murders by Agatha Christie is #13 in the Hercule Poirot series and another excellent crime novel. I always enjoy M. Poirots deductions; the way his little grey cells get a work-out. Highly entertaining, and once again, highly recommended.",1516838400,4

The clues were very obvious so I figured out the main suspect pretty early on but I still really enjoyed this book. It is chockablock with very interesting characters - some new and some old. Nesbo juggles three different story lines expertly and for the first time in the series takes an in depth look at the darker motives and rationale behind human behaviour.

6159,642,1778,"My Review of About That Kiss by Jill Shalvis

About That Kiss  by Jill Shalvis is a delightful, charming, romantic story with a touch of mystery. Jill Shalvis describes her colorful quirky characters as flawed, complicated and sometimes complex. Then again, do you know anyone that is perfect?

Is it nice for a gentleman to kiss and tell? In this story, after Joe an alpha type of guy kisses Kylie on an un-gentlemanly way, its a good thing Kylie didn't hold her breath waiting for Joe to call. Kylie is a talented wood-crafter, learned from her late grandfather who taught her how to make creative things. Kylies parents were too young to raise her, and that job fell to her grandfather. Joe also comes from a dysfunctional family where his father is suffering from PSTD, and locks the doors to the house at least 5 times. Joe helps take care of his sister and father. Joe now works for a security company that can handle difficult situations.

Kylie sees Joe at work, and they tease each other. Unfortunately something priceless and meaningful to Kylie has been stolen. After getting letters with pictures, Kalie turns to Joe to help her. Both are working together trying to make the pieces of the puzzles fit.

Working so closely is becoming a problem, since both Kylie and Joe cant forget that kiss. Perhaps trying again, will make them forget, or remember?

I appreciate that Jill Shalvis brings up the problems of PSTD, and how difficult it is for the person and the family. There should be more help available.

I would recommend this novel for readers that enjoy a romantic story. Happy Reading !",1516924800,4
6160,503,459,"Sea of Rust is a post-apocalyptic robot novel. The initial setup is very similar to Charlie Stross' Saturn's Children, except where Saturn's Children is optimistic and expansive, Sea of Rust is pessimistic, gritty, and well, apocalyptic.

The idea is that after the robot uprising that wiped out humanity, what's left of the robots are split between multiple mainframe factions that are struggling to control the entire planet and all the independent robots that still haven't been brought under mainframe control. It's an entirely illogical setup, since most likely just a few hours of earlier sentience would create an insurmountable lead for one of the intelligence involved.

The narrative focuses on one independent robot and her search for spare parts. The style is that of a single-person competent viewpoint that alternates between historical exposition and ""current"" problem-solving. The entire narrative is well-written, with transparent prose and made-for-special-effects battle scenes and a Hollywood-ready big climax and denouement.

Is it as deep as Saturn's Children? No. It's shallow Hollywood stuff. But it's easy to read and a perfect airplane novel, and at $1.99, priced appropriately. Mildly recommended.",1516924800,4
6161,560,1778,"After Kylie and Joe share a hot kiss one night, things between them are a bit awkward.  When he comes to her woodworker shop to purchase a birthday present for his sister, Joe ends up making a deal with Kylie to help her find a lost family heirloom in exchange for the gift.  This puts Joe and Kylie in close proximity and their passion (and friendship) builds to inferno size.  Joe is absolutely yummy, and I loved Kylie's ""I can do it myself"" attitude.  They are perfect for each other!

Only problem is that Joe's a ""no relationship"" kind of guy because of past situations that have left deep scars on his heart.  But Kylie sees and feels something else in him -- it's just that Joe is too afraid to admit what he's really feeling.

I loved this story.  Joe and Kylie are so good together, and it's an interesting journey for Joe to realize what everyone else sees in how he feels about Kylie. It made for a super romantic story, and the missing heirloom story was a tight little mystery that kept things moving along at a great pace. I was at ""the end"" before I knew it as I devoured this book in a day.

About that Kiss is a fantastic standalone addition to the series. I definitely recommend it. About that Kiss might be my favorite in the series...so far!",1516924800,5

One thousand years after the One State has conquered the world, the survivors live in a city of glass and steele, enclosed behind a giant Green Wall, and outside the wall is destruction from the Two-hundred Years War, an unknown, wild and forbidden place. The city is designed for mass surveillance of the citizens, and the Bureau of Guardians (secret police) watch everything. Logic controls society completely, and an individuals behavior is based on formulas and equations created by the One State - thus ensuring security and happiness for all citizens. (Sound familiar to another novel?)

A man called D-503 (everyone is a number, no proper names) is a scientist heading the creation of the spacecraft Integral, which will allow the One State to invade and conquer the other planets. His lover, O-90, has been assigned to D-503, and they have Sexy-time on scheduled nights. O-90 cannot have children and this makes her deeply sad.

But one day D-503 meets another woman, I-330, and is attracted to her. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol, and flirts with D-503, and all of this is highly illegal. But D-503 becomes obsessed with the new woman, his strange dreams confuse him. I-330 reveals to him that a secret society is planning a revolt, and she wants D-503 to assist because of his his position while building the Integral spacecraft.

6165,457,618,"NO SPOILERS. I PROMISE!

After spending a whole day peeling back the Night Film tentacles from around my head, I can gratefully report that Im almost back to my normal self after reading this one.

Let me correct the last part of that sentence. One does not simply read Night Film. Before you open this book, take a moment to prepare yourself.

You are about to enter into a multi-media, multi-sensory whole body experience.

GURRRL, GET READY FOR A black magic spell to be cast upon your coconut.

You will know nothing but Night Film. Think of nothing but Night Film. If you do sleep, your dreams will be the creepy, dark type. You start to feel you are being watched. You will dig out your long lost pepper spray and start carrying it with you on walks. You will find yourself googling Stanislas Cordova. Was he actually given the 1980 Oscar for Best Director by the lovely Goldie Hawn?

YES! YOU KNOW ITS FICTIONAL, BUT YOUR MIND WONT ACCEPT THE FACT. It is presented in such a realistic manner with authentic photos, videos, and articles from Vanity Fair, The Rolling Stone, Time Magazine and The New York Times. There are police reports, artifacts, and interview transcriptions to help with your investigation. Its one thing to read about a haunting photo, but to have that photo to study for yourself? Genius.

PLOT SUMMARY: The daughter of a reclusive horror-film director Stanislas Cordova is found dead, and fallen journalist Scott McGrath falls into a maddening wormhole of trying to uncover the truth behind the girls murder. Night Film gets darker and more twisted the deeper McGrath ventures into Cordovas worldthe man hasn't been seen in public in 30 years, and his films are so horrifying that its believed the person who created them must be seriously disturbed as well.

The book is bone-chilling scary, but not in an obvious slasher way. The author creates and instills just enough fear to make your imagination run away with a suitcase and never come back. This is a major theme of Night Film: the power of imagination and the human mind which seeks to bridge the gap between the two. When faced with the unknown, we tend to look for answers in religion or just plain old superstitions. Can our fears all be explained in concrete, provable terms? Does evil always have to have a reason to exist? Pessl doesnt give us all the answers and thats why every person that reads Night Film will take away something different. I love that.

A genre-bending book, I have no idea how it could be classified justly. I would recommend it first and foremost just for the murder investigation at the heart of the plot. From the prologue until the bitter end, discovering what really happened to Ashley Cordova will keep you turning the pages all night. Now, add in the multi-media presentation because that greatly enhances the story and experience. This technique is unique without being gimmicky, and is truly original. Next, sprinkle in some Stephen King horror elements and just a touch of the supernaturalvoila! You have Night Film.

This is not a perfect book, much as I want all my favorites to be. It is a bit too long and the ending is not as satisfying as it could be. But, these minor points are easily overcome by Pessls fabulous writing style. She reminds me of my two spirit animals, Gillian Flynn and Tana French, writing in a fluid, descriptive manner. Her characters are fleshed out, the plot is addictive and the mood she sets? Wow. Dark, haunting, sobering.

I began this book on audio. I quickly realized I needed to see written words, since this is a complex GIANT novel. It was only then that I understood how much I would have missed by sticking only with audio! I hadnt read a ton of reviews and I didn't even know about the multi-media part of the book. Trust me! This is where the magic happens! You feel like you are right there on the case with Scott McGrath, studying clues and helping to solve the twisted Cordova mystery.

The Kindle multi-media version is amazing and when coupled with the astonishingly good audio, well, you can understand why I had to recover a day when I finished. If you are open to a bit of horror in your psychologically twisty mysteries, this is the book for you. I cant recommend it enough!",1516924800,5
6166,497,657,This book is a Beauty and The Beast re-telling and it was such a wonderful read. I love fairy tale re-tellings and I just knew I would love this. There are many twists and turns throughout the story that are different and keeps you wanting more. I am so very glad at the end the author took time out to tell of what happened next.

6167,9,132,"This book  fell short for me.  The background of the actual women's spy ring, the Alice network, could have made a good book, and that part was interesting.  The characters, however, were so harlequin romance types that it was very unbelievable.

I like a good historical fiction book, and this wasn't it.",1516924800,3
6168,941,326,"This book didn't just retell beauty and the beast.  It took heavy themes and aspects of the tale, wove a bit of mythology in it, and invented a whole new tale that just had to be told.

This is really great stuff. At first the book seemed to move a little on the slow side but then BAM all of a sudden there are things happening and you realize it wasn't truly going all that slow, it was all building up to what was to come in many ways and when the fan is hit, it is hit! The book takes you to places you never saw coming and you become really invested in the lives of the characters, and let me tell you there are times you want to reach right on in the pages and give a good stern talking to or a good swift kick in the butt to a character or two (when you read it you will know exactly to whom I am referring and to which parts I refer to and it is more than one person!) The scenery that is written on the pages feels like it literally exists simply because you can see it so well when you imagine it.  By the time the end rolls along, you will likely be no longer on the edge of your seat but completely on the floor. I'll not give you any clue as to what unfolds in the story because I know me and I know I'll wind up spilling the beans because I'm still reeling and hyped from the story as I type this so I'll just say you get enough info from the book synopsis to dive into this one and have a good time.

I still ended up enjoying it.  I liked seeing Maxon and America as parents, and the children they have raised.  I do feel the ending was rushed and I did not connect with any of the love interests except the one (which was who you are supposed to love).

I also did  not love the ending.  Yes, it is a cliff hanger for you to continue on.  But, I just did not love it as it was very rushed.  I also do not like that similar things happened like in the last book with the ending.  We will see where the rest of the series goes.",1516924800,3

6171,457,819,"You don't know how happy I was to get my greedy little paws on both the audio and Kindle versions of THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. My expectations were through the roof! Have you seen all those 5 star reviews?

As it turns out, the book doesn't live up to the hype. Yes, it is as addictive as popcorn, I couldn't put it down. But, there are so many disappointing drawbacks that I couldn't rate it a 4 star read.

For audio-lovers, do not waste your precious Audible credit on this one. It is absolute trash. The actress portraying our boozy, traumatized victim/narrator is chirpy and confident sounding. Talk about a mindf*k! It does not work. In contrast, a similar book, The Girl on the Train is sheer perfection on audio.

At about 40%, I turned off the audio, opened my Kindle and aaaaahhhh...the world made sense again. You know how much I love my unreliable narrators and our girl, Anna, is a doozy. Although she is terrified to step outside of her home, all kinds of interesting events still manage to take place in her small neighborhood. She spies on the nearby residents out of boredom. She's a regular Gladys Kravitz (you know, from Bewitched?). We can't trust Anna's narration because she is depressed and suffering from a traumatic event. And she pops a lot of pills and glugs wine as a chaser. Yeah, her take on the neighbors is suspect at best.

All this is great. Absorbing. But, you know those people that use too many words and make simple matters overly boring? AJ Finn is one of those kind of writers. My patience runs thin with passages like this:

----Frigid air seizes my body, so raw that my heart feels faint; storms my clothes, sets them trembling around me. My ears brim with the sound of wind. I'm filling up with cold, running over with cold.------

Ugggghhhhh. I think she's cold.

The book is so long and repetitive. It has an interesting, yet heavily borrowed upon plot and there are a couple of major twists. The plot twists are predictable, you will see them from a mile away, but it is still fun to see if your hunches were right (they will be).

Just one more thing. Finn shoves a ton of film references into the storyline. At first, I loved it. Then, it becomes too much. It's as if he's saying, ""I'm not borrowing plot lines, I'm just referencing them."" Wink-wink. It's all too heavy handed and cutesy, we know what's really going on.

Of course peace is not what he gets.  Instead he is pulled into a horrible situation he wants no part of.  Politics, gods, curses, magic and impossible odds.  Anything else I can say about it would only be a diminishment of how completely awesome it is.  Seriously, ye have to read it.",1516924800,5

6180,1079,1051,"Hygge is a Danish word that encompasses the feeling of cosiness and living well. Denmark is often called the happiest country on earth and the concept of hygge is one of the main attributions to this. With the darker winter months settling in and people's working and social lives being more busy and stressful than ever before, we can all use a little hygge in our lives. And this gorgeous book by the CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen can help you do just that.

The comforting feeling of togetherness described in the book sounds similar to the Dutch phrase gezellig, which is indeed likened to it within this little book of happiness. However, opposed to gezelligheid (as well as gemtlichkeit in Germany and hominess in Canada) hygge doesn't just describe the feeling of cosiness, it's a verb and the Danish even invite people over for some hygge. So rather than describing something that has already happened, they actively seek to create hygge.

And therein lies the difference. Happiness isn't something that occurs by accident, it's created and in The Little Book of Hygge author Meik Wiking talks about the different ways in which the Danish people achieve this, from the importance of lighting to food & drink, and everything in between. It's a really interesting and insightful journey through different aspects that can create a platform for a happier lifestyle. And, befitting the author's job, the road to living well as described within the book isn't only paved with examples of how the Danish achieve it, but also studies that support the theory.

The Little Book of Hygge was an absolute delight and inspiration to read. I'm sure I'm not the only one who in recent years has become more and more consumed by work and stress, and it can be difficult to break out of the pattern of work-sleep-repeat and truly enjoy life and the little moments within it. This book, while of course not changing my life for me completely or taking away all of the stress from work, provides a basis for a healthier and more enjoyable life.

It's filled with tips and tricks to achieving hygge, many of which are really not that hard to achieve as long as you make sure you actually do them. Things that stood out to me in particular included creating a hyggekrog (a place in the home where you'd love to snuggle up in a blanket with a book and a cup of tea), non-scented candles, and the importance of feeling close to nature.

There are also delicious recipes included within this little tome of happiness, a month by month breakdown to show you how you can achieve hygge all throughout the year, and even a series of ideas to create hygge on the cheap  so it's achievable for anyone at any point in their life. This book is a true treasure of happiness and insight into a very unique part of the Danish culture, and one we can all learn a lot from.

Not only that, but it looks absolutely stunning too and would make a gorgeous gift for friends, family and colleagues this Christmastime, don't you think? We can all use a little more hygge in our lives  and isn't spreading the love of hygge, hygge in itself?",1517011200,5
6181,666,417,"I am a huge fan of Adam Silvera's books. I've enjoyed all three so far but this one may be my favorite. Silvera is so talented at writing amazing characters and such unique stories that are easy to get hooked into.

I started this book 24 hours ago almost exactly and now I am writing the review. I could not put the book down for the life of me and when I did put the book down I was already scheduling around the stuff I had to do for when I could read again. Funnily enough though, when we got to the fourth (and final) section of the story, I found myself on social media. Desperately avoiding the book sitting inches from me. With a book with the title They Both Die At The End and with two amazing main characters you have fallen in love with, it's hard to continue.

Mateo and Rufus were so great. I loved Mateo so much, he's a cautious eighteen year old that likes to play video games and keep it safe. I related a lot to Mateo in those parts of his personality. Rufus is more adventurous. He's not worried about keeping safe or being cautious. He's got no problems with confrontation and he has a group of friends he knows will always have his back, where Mateo is used to being alone. Especially with his father in the hospital. I liked that Rufus was interested in photography and I liked the way his Instagram played a part in their adventures.

The premise is such a cool idea and it's what made me really excited to read it. Well, that and it's written by Silvera. I think the concept was executed extremely well. I would have liked to know more about how they know someone will die. But there is a part of me that didn't mind it was vague. It definitely makes you think. What would you do with your day if you knew it was your last day alive?

Without giving up any spoilers, there's one part I was incredibly surprised by. You wouldn't think it, with the title of the book, but the story definitely had moments that caught me off guard. I was really impressed and I appreciate that I thought I knew how the story was going to go down and I was proven wrong. I was ready for one my issues with the book was that it would be that the plot was predictable. And I haven't been so happy to be proven wrong!

I did have a couple issues with the story, and that was the romantic aspect. I had a feeling it was going to happen, since both of our characters are either gay or bisexual and Silvera writes amazing gay relationships. But because they had just met each other less than a day ago, it felt like it was escalating quickly. I don't think it was full blown ""insta-love"" because the romance is barely there and when you're in high stakes moments like ""last day on Earth"" I definitely give the boys a pass. However, there were moments where I couldn't help but think it was over the top. There were moments it felt forced. The only other thing that bothered me is the idea that the way Mateo lived his life wasn't ""living"". Maybe it's because I relate to Mateo in the sense that I'm not very adventurous but I think it comes down to individuality. I was happy to see both of the boys learning from each other, and I thought it worked well. But a part of me would get a bit irked at Mateo (or someone else) insinuating he wasn't living.

With that being said, I absolutely loved this book. I bawled like a baby at the last section and I'm pretty sure, like always with Silvera's books, my heart is going to need some time to heal. I do recommend this book to everyone because I think the themes are really important ones.  But have your issues at the ready.",1517011200,5

6183,1080,618,"It is better to read this book without any prior knowledge of what it is about, but here is a short, vague synopsis anyway. Night Film is a psychological mystery thriller about a girl who dies and the investigative reporter who is trying to figure out the truth about her mysterious family. This book is a dark mind-bending roller coaster. I best heard it described this way: you think you've hit rock bottom when you realize you're standing on another trap door. I've never read a book in this genre before, but this was probably not a good place to start because no book will ever live up to it.
The best part about reading Night Film is that the book is filled with photographs, documents, and other visual elements, many of which have hidden content in them. If you download the Night Film Decoder app, you can scan the pictures to access the bonus content. It's seriously awesome.
I recommend just blindly jumping into this book if you're even remotely interested at this point.",1517011200,5

6185,1080,266,"This book changed my life, as the title told me it would.

I am moving across the country next month, and I have way more stuff than I want to move. So it's time to declutter. That was the main reason I picked up this book, and I am so glad that I did. I had no idea it would have such an impact on me.

Marie Kondo's approach to tidying up your home is based on two steps: deciding whether or not to keep something, and deciding where to put it. The steps must be done in that order for the process to work. Her entire book focuses on surrounding yourself only with items that bring you joy.

She starts off by asking you to visualize your desired lifestyle and your desired home, and then ask yourself why you want it to be like that? Keep asking yourself why until you reach the ultimate answer of that it makes you happy. The purpose of this book is to help you achieve happiness in your life. It is stressful to always be around items that don't bring you joy or things that you don't need, so just eliminate them from your life. Choose what you want to keep, not what you want to get rid of.

To declutter, you start with clothes, then move to books, papers, miscellaneous items, and finish with mementos and sentimental items. You must declutter by category, not by room, and you must go through everything in one category at the same time. To decide what to keep, you physically touch or pick up each item, look at it, and ask yourself, ""Does this bring me joy?"" If the answer is an immediate yes, keep it. If you hesitate to answer or say no, then the item doesn't bring you joy and you should discard it.

Her approach to cleaning isn't hard, but it's effective. I cleaned out my closet four times in the last month before I read this book and got rid of two boxes of clothes. After reading her book, I went through my closet again and got rid of another two boxes of clothes. Now I'm left with only the clothes that I actually wear and like, and I can honestly say that it's made me happier.

Although the author writes with a holier-than-thou attitude and sometimes sounds condescending, her process of helping you organize your life and get rid of unnecessary items works. I've read this book two times already, and I intend to read it again as I continue to declutter my life.",1517011200,5

His sister, Felicity,  who would much rather go to medical school is being forced to go to finishing school, and Montys best friend (whom he is in love with) Percy, who is mixed race and going to Holland after the Tour. Touring the continent was a common thing for aristocracy to do during Georgian times. Monty reminds me of a younger Jack Harkness from Doctor Who and Torchwood fame.

Favorite Character: Liam (so much depth throughout the story!)

Spoiler Free: Oh man, I could not put this book down! This definitely wouldve been one of those devour in one sitting books had I not been reading it on my commute (and been forced to put it down constantly.) Right from the beginning, the plot and world just draw you in. Youre constantly forced to consider every event and the secrets it holds, as Jules constantly reminds you that secrets are everywhere, and the Geldings and other royals will do whatever it takes to keep them. And this book definitely delivered on that front! I questioned everything, had so many theories, and still I was surprised by every twist this book seemed to take! That, plus the able to fully capture my attention without a full focus on romance, just proved how well written this book was, and how fascinating the idea was.

Almost everything about this book screamed that it was just another YA fantasy book in the kingdoms wave. Yes, the premise seemed awesome, but so many do. So needless to say, I definitely went in with mediocre expectations. But with each new page, the book constantly rose above and beyond anything I expected it to be!

Careful! Spoilers beyond this point!

Spoilers: Ahhhh. Just everything that happened in those last 50 pages has me reeling!

I cant believe I didn't realize Caro was controlling everything all along. It was so obvious there was something off about her (her constant watching of Jules, often pushing her to do things that could reveal the truth, etc.), but I still was so blind to it! She seemed so trustworthy to me, as a reader, that its no wonder Jules fell into her trap in the actual story.

Also Liam! I definitely guessed early on that Liam was the true love interest, but I still didn't expect that whole mess to turn out as it did! (Why didn't she kiss him!!!) Also, can I just say again that I love when MCs find out the big bad guy is actually a sweetheart? Definitely feel that vibe happening here, and I love it! Only thing Im mad about is that Liam didn't end up going with her. So now in Evermore I first need to wait for them to reunite.

Also, what is up with Roan? It was never fully mentioned, but there was definitely more to him than originally shown, and I hope the next book starts unraveling that thread. From Bea warning Jules that she was better than that snake, Bea smiling at Roan until realizing Jules was with him (when servants are usually pretty shy around the royals?), and Roan always smelling like a different type of flower/perfume, it definitely seems like that dude was super shady and sleeping around with more than a few servant girls. In the end, I think this realization, either conscious or subconscious, is what made his death not break Juless heart. Maybe she realized that the kiss they shared wasn't one out of love, but of lust or manipulation instead? Who knows! I just hope this is a path thats uncovered farther.

And then there was the plot, which didn't let go for a moment the entire book. From page to page, we are constantly gaining more clues to put together the puzzle, and it makes even the normally filler scenes super interesting to read!",1517011200,5

6189,1080,1076,"I still don't really understand this book.

It started off so strong in Cassie's perspective, describing the current situation of her world and what exactly was happening with these waves of alien invasions. I was almost positive it was going to be a five-star book in the beginning. But then the point of view switched to that of Ben, and it kept alternating between Cassie and Ben throughout the book. I honestly only cared about Cassie's story, so I didn't like these alternating perspectives. But this wasn't all. There were random places where the point of view switched to that of Evan and to that of Sammy, whose stories were told in third person perspectives. So there ended up being four different narrators, two in first person, two in third person, who switched around in no particular order. This was the weakest part of the book. I'm sure it wouldn't normally be that hard to follow along, but there was one male narrator on the audiobook for the three male points of view without introducing who was speaking when each new character's section started. Often I wasn't even sure who was talking for a few chapters.

This novel didn't feel particularly special compared to all the other dystopian books out there. Overall, the idea of the story reminded me strongly of The Host. The 5th Wave is an alien novel about aliens that come to this earth and take over by invading the human hosts. I loved The Host, so I was a little disappointed when I started noticing the uncanny comparisons. It would have been nice if the second alien novel I read would have not been really similar to the first I read. But it is as it is.

I'm still not sure what's happening with some major plot points of this story. I'm not sure if that's because it's harder to pay attention to audiobooks, so it's my own fault that I missed those details, or if that's because those details weren't explained well in the story. I'm going to finish the trilogy and see if I understand the story better as I progress through it. I hope so. I think there is a lot of potential here.",1517011200,3

6194,1080,357,"Written in verse, this book follows H, a young Vietnamese girl, through one year during the time of the Vietnam War. It is based on a true story of the author, Thanhha Lai, when she immigrated to Alabama from Vietnam. If read carefully, this book has a lot of deeper meaning to it than the words can simply tell you. It is full of culture. This book is really short and I recommend you read it in one sitting to get the most meaning from it.

H lives with her mother and three older brothers while their father fights in the war. They are a poor family living in a desperate situation, and you really get to see this through H's descriptions of food and her town and people. The war threatens H and her family to flee their home and board a ship in hope of a better life.

H said they were a poor family and each had only one pair of shoes. I have an aunt that is from Vietnam, and she told me a story of her childhood when her whole family had only one pair of shoes to share between all of them. I understand that this novel is based on the author's own experience, but her family must have not been as poor as others. It's interesting to me to compare these two experiences of life in Vietnam.

Being written in free verse really adds to the story. It helps you see inside the mind of ten-year-old H with her quick, sharp thoughts. I don't think there was any better way this story could have been told.",1517011200,3

This is my second Jane Austen book. I'm ashamed to say that. I'm also sad that I never had the chance to read these in school. It's never too late though! I both loved and loathed the ending. That's all I will give on that. I do not intend to spoil it for anybody who hasn't read it.

The narrators were fantastic too. I saw the name Emma Thomson as I was listening and I was immediately drawn to the name. I knew I'd heard it before but I didn't know where. I took the time to look her up. I immediately figured out two different movies I would have remembered her from. One of which is technically more than one. Harry Potter. She's a great narrator!

I fully recommend this book as I would recommend any classic novel. They are so simplistically beautiful and thought-provoking. I can't ever gush enough over classical novels. I definitely recommend other Jane Austen novels especially.",1517011200,5

And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered

But it's all right, it's all right

Still, when I think of the road
we're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what went wrong

History is that certainty produced at the point where the imperfections of memory meet the inadequacies of documentation.

Memories, ordinarily, are deeply, strongly connected to the emotions we felt at the time we experienced that moment in time, which over time, became a memory of one sort or another. Cherished, loving memories, memories of suffering or embarrassment, memories of loss, devastating loss of loved ones, loss of livelihood, of homes, of betrayal. A momentary flicker of a thought or a phrase read or overheard can hurl us back through time, and we remember or perhaps we remember what we believe happened, a chipped, scuffed version thats been smoothed away through time, wrapped in bubble wrap so that the vision cant help but be distorted. But still we cling to that memory.

We live in timeit holds us and moulds usbut Ive never felt I understood it very well. And Im not referring to theories, about how it bends and doubles back, or may exist elsewhere in parallel versions. No I mean ordinary, everyday time, which clocks and watches assure us passes regularly, tick-tock, click-clock. Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us times malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missinguntil the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return.

Tony Webster is the narrator of this Man Booker Prize winning story, a man now in his sixties, he is reminiscing as this begins on the school days and friends of his youth.

Originally there were three, until a fourth comes along, a young man named Adrian Finn. After a few short days of observation, Adrian presence among them began to turn into friendship. And then they were four.

In those days, we imagined ourselves as being kept in some kind of holding pen, waiting to be released into our lives. And when that moment came, our livesand time itselfwould speed up. How were we to know that our lives had in any case begun, that some advantage had already been gained, some damage already inflicted? Also, that our release would only be into a larger holding pen, whose boundaries would be at first undiscernible.

Those days of restrained by parents rules, societys rules for those believing themselves to be mature adults, but who have yet to face that being set free from the laws of childhood also releases them from the comforts of those days, as well. As Janis Joplin sang Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose.

Reminiscing about these crucial years leads to some lovely prose, and a story that is less a story about the lives of these boys-to-men, and more of a story about memory, our memories, these bits and pieces of the bits and pieces we recall from some long ago event that hold such magical holds on our hearts regardless of their truth, overall. It becomes our truth, because it is what our hearts recognize as true.

As such, the story within wasn't quite as much a conventional story that relayed the stories of multiple characters, as it was a story about the unreliability of memory, and the assumptions we make on what we think we see, the stories we tell ourselves of what we saw, what we remember, and then turn into memories.

Essentially, we see them, their lives through Tony, these characters, and their lives, are shrouded, filtered, as a part of Tonys memories, they seem somewhat partially drawn, as though they were created as half-formed to begin with. As though their purpose is to show us the unreliability of memory, to confirm that what you end up remembering isn't always the same as what you witnessed.

6201,55,1782,"Since 2000, democracy has gone into retreat - Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Philippines, Venezuela, Hungary, and now the Trump administration in America. Frum's concern via the Trump administration does not involve a bold overthrow of the Constitution, but stealthy paralysis of governance, an accumulating subversion of norms, and incitement of private violence to radicalize supporters. Frum's book tells of those who enable Donald Trump. Political decisions and economic trends have divided the U.S. along lines of class, race, region, national origin, and cultural identity. Even the bonds between men and women have become attenuated.

Even before Trump became a presidential candidate, American politics had been veering toward extremism and instability. He was elected thanks in great part to voters disgusted by a status quo that was ceasing to work for more and more of them. The largest and most loyal subset were men who felt devalued in the economy and disrespected in the culture, who chafed at being scolded for the 'privilege' while succumbing to disability, drugs, and early death. He has not kept faith with those voters, but they have kept faith with them.

He has persuaded millions to ignore information they need as 'fake news' from a 'corrupt media,' allowed foreign states and local politicians to tamper with the integrity of American elections to his own benefit, demands high officials disregard the law in favor of personal loyalty to him, alienated allies, and goaded small ones to the edge of war, inflamed the ethnic and class divisions that empowered him, and enriched himself in government.

The slowdown in economic growth since 2000 and the shock of the Great Recession have also embittered politics. Ill feeling over the Supreme Court decision that elevated Bush II over Al Gore has never healed. Failures and mistakes of government policy from the 9/11 attacks, the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, never-ending Mideast conflict, weak recovery from the Great Recession, debt-ceiling fights,  birthers, radicalization of the Supreme Court and appellate court seats, attempts to legislate without hearings/CBO scoring,  have further reduced respect for government. Reagan's failure to solve the immigration problem - with Obama attempting amnesty in various forms (DACA, expanding the protected population to include their parents

Frum, however, is more than a little biased in favor of democracy. China's accomplishments over the last near half-century, on the other hand, provide strong reason to consider increased autocracy. I'm well-educated and generally well-informed - however, I consider myself unable to make good judgments on much/most proposed legislation - the days of having to address a relatively limited number of fairly simple issues are long gone. Meanwhile, it has become impossible or almost impossible to find unbiased news sources that cover issues in significant depth. Another example - Russia. Russia went down a U.S. prescribed path upon the breakup of the Soviet Union - that created chaos, a serious recession, and a substantial reduction in the expected life-spans of Russians (We're now undergoing our own reduction, though fortunately not as serious.) Enormous amounts of time are now wasted reading/listening to/discussing politics - meanwhile, the sense of heading in the wrong direction climbs, and the quality of our politicos is falling (more contentious, ideology-based).",1517011200,5
6202,778,61,"Im always a wee bit leery of jumping into one of these never-ending series. Ive had my eye on Jo Nesbos Harry Hole for a while, wondering if I want/need to start at the beginning. With the movie being released, it seemed that surely The Snowman must be able to standalone and must be one of the best Harry Hole books.

As a standalone, The Snowman works just fine. Sure, Harry has a history, all characters in any book do, but I was easily able to catch up with Harrys past. Yes, if I were to go back, I know of a few of the characters who will be lost. Any reader should easily be able to roll straight into The Snowman.

In my experience, the most important part to a great Nordic noir is the protagonist. Harry Hole is a brooding lone wolf; he operates just outside of what is acceptable to his superiors. This makes him the best the police have, but he can never advance beyond his current position. This is a familiar trope, but Nesbo has developed a depth with Harry Hole to make him standout within the genre.

The plot moved at a good pace. I don't want a book that is over as soon as it starts, but don't drag it out without keeping it interesting. Nesbo kept the story engaging with a great selection of questionable characters. It changed several times from a who done it? to a cat and mouse. Once it really got going I could not put the book down.

The Snowman was a great introduction to Jo Nesbos Harry Hole. It had an engaging protagonist, a plot with massive twists and turns, and a perfectly balanced cast of characters.",1517011200,4

The Selection is by no means a great work of literature or masterly written, but it is an extremely entertaining and fun read. I found myself rooting for the characters all throughout the book.

While I have heard of Amelia Bedelia before I have never read the story. I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud. The picture of the turkey was as humorous as it was disturbing.

I expected to enjoy this a lot more than I did. I mean, there were things that were better than the last one, but the first two books stayed a lot more enjoyable in my mind than this one. I think the pacing got a little off, and I found myself bored in spots. I mean, I honestly was a lot more excited to read a few other books than I was to read this one. Of course, when I picked this book back up, I was excited to be in it, but sometimes I just wasn't feeling getting back to it.

Maybe it was the pacing? I mean, toward the middle, it got a bit...not really boring since everything is always going on, but I found myself not enjoying it as much as I should. It was jumping all over at that point and we were hopping from Jason to Frank to Hazel when we had only been jumping to Annabeth, Percy, and Leo for the most part of the book. It was throwing me off.

The adventure in this book was pretty great for the most part. I loved Annabeth's and Percy's storyline, and goodness, Riordan can do a setting wonderfully. He created a world that was dark, intriguing, and exciting in its own weird way. I thought it was so cool. The rest of the team had an interesting storyline as well, and I especially enjoyed more depth to Coach Hedge's and Leo's storylines when they got to go off on their own for a while.

Speaking of Leo, omg, I loved his little moments on a certain island. I WAS DEAD AND I FOUND MY NEW SHIP AND I JUST WANT THIS TO BE A FOREVER THING MAKE IT A FOREVER THING BECAUSE I AM DEAD. He was still fantastic as always and I just want to cry forever because I know I'm going getting one more book of my lovely.

I loved some of the great character development in this one as well. Nico was finally given more of a spotlight to shine and a lot of what I had always been questioning was explained. I think Riordan did a fantastic job with it, and I'm so hoping Nico shines even more in the next book. I also loved the new character of Bob. BOB IS LOVE. BOB IS NEW LOVE.

Update-On-Mandy-Still-Not-Giving-Two-Crowns-About-Jason-Update: I still don't care for Jason. I feel like that is legit in every review of this series, because I just don't see anything in him. He's just the hero. Everyone else seems to have little complexities to him, but I just...I don't feel anything from him - including the ship between him and Piper. But I'm not really into the other characters well especially the ones that I was iffy about - including Annabeth and Piper.

Speaking of Annabeth, I super enjoyed her in this book! In previous books, I had been on the edge with her, but this one, I totally get it now and I super enjoyed her characterization. And the ship between her and Percy? Major loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

Overall, I did have a few struggles with this book, but it was still Percy fun. Riordan still is a master of an adventure and setting and characters. I can't wait for this conclusion, but I also can really wait because I don't want this series to ever end???? SO TORN. 3.5 crowns rounded up to a four and a Jasmine rating!",1517097600,4
6219,200,669,"Style
As anyone whos read old literature knows, the style of writing has changed dramatically over time. There is an obvious reason why the motto show, don't tell was adopted and this is a perfect example of why. So much of the story is told through hearsay. It is near impossible to really determine what actually happened, but we are just expected to believe what the characters say to be true. That being said, I did believe it. There was something in the particular tone of the writing and/or characters that made me believe every word.

Disjointed
It is quite interesting to reflect upon stories that once were. They are written very disjointed and disconnected, jumping from scene to scene and location to location, offering very little detail. Even the detail offered was not written in a manner as to be enjoyable or vivid. It was only offered as needed and the rest of the story focused on the characters.

Characters
I liked Dr. Jekyll. I liked Mr. Hyde. I wasn't really a huge fan of the narrator, but that has more to do with how fully he follows the ideals of that particular time. His prejudices and personal opinions were very obvious and annoying. I also wasn't sure he was the best narrator for the story, but oh well. Perhaps this, too, was a style thing of days long past.

That Ending
I was very satisfied with the ending of this story. It was not quite what I expected, having never heard the true tale of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and knowing only adaptations. That being said, I thought it quite fitting for the story and the style in which the story was told. No doubt it has plenty of remnants of the time period as well.",1517097600,4

6228,1079,303,"Ever since laying eyes on the gorgeous cover for The Muse before it was even published I was keen to read it, but with an ever growing pile of books to review I didn't end up picking this one up. Luckily for me, my flat mate found a copy at our local book exchange, thinking it was something I would enjoy  and she was absolutely right.

I didn't know anything about the story before picking it up, but with this dual time frame narrative Jessie Burton has created another historic read that while focusing on purely fictional characters, in its detail feels incredible realistic (so much so that I Googled the artist at the heart of the tale but alas, he is not a real person).

The story of the artist and the people touched by the work along the way is both harrowing and thought provoking, and the way the two timelines are entwined, set again the backdrop of both the lead up to the second world war and the 1960s, was as inspired as it was fascinating.",1517097600,4
6229,730,607,"I have so many mixed feelings about this book! First, there are way more characters than I initially realized. The way their stories intertwined through chance encounters was satisfying, but Im not sure it was necessary or even beneficial to the overall story. It just seemed like a lot of filler information. Also, I understand that this isn't supposed to be a dystopian sci-fi novel BUT I still wish the characters had some depth. I've seen this book described as a 'futuristic Gossip Girl' and I think that is a perfect description. The characters on the upper floors are extremely shallow and those on the lower levels are trying to emulate them. With that being said, the book is slow paced. If you're looking for a sci-fi plot with substance or an epic conflict this is not the book for you. The story just deals with a group of people living their lives and facing everyday issues. This aspect did sort of appeal to me at first, but I slowly started to lose interest 200 pages in. Lastly, the thing that turned me off the most was a ""forbidden"" relationship. I'm not sure if we're intended to ship these two characters or be completely revolted. I sided with the latter.

Overall, the ending was interesting and engaged me enough that I may pick up the sequel at some point in the future.",1517097600,3
6230,1079,607,"The Thousandth Floor is what you get when you move the bitchiness and backstabbing of privileged teens from Gossip Girls' Upper East Side to a dystopian future where a 10,000 feet high skyscraper separates the working class from the filthy rich.

The wealthier someone is, the higher they live in the building, and no-one is more privileged than the Fuller family living at the very top on the thousandth floor. Siblings Avery and Atlas Fuller seem to have everything they could possible want in life, but there is one thing that has always been out of reach.

On the fringes of their lives are friends living a few floors down; Eris, Leda, Cord, to name but a few, each leading a more glamourous life than the other, but none happy with what they've got. And then there are those that live much further down, the plebs that work in tthe fancy clubs the rich kids frequent, such as Muriel, Watt and Rylin.

Through a series of twists and turns, all of their individual stories collide on a faithful night at the Fuller apartment when a terrible accident binds the unlikely teenagers together. Despite the opening prologue hinting at the novel's conclusion, it still came as a shock to me. While I was already gripped by the glitz, glamour and slightly sci-fi world of The Thousandth Floor, after THAT ending I am completely hooked and ready for the next installment in the series.

6232,278,1225,"This is quite the page turner of a British psychological thriller.  It is told in three very different voices.

First there is Alice, unit manager of the critical care units at St. Catherine's Hospital, which entails being part matron and part nurse. She feels close to one of the patients in her unit - Frank - and uses him as her sounding board about work and especially about the continuing attempts of her and her husband to have children.

Frank is an alcoholic, had a stroke, and is considered to be in a Permanent Vegetative State, unaware, but Alice has the feeling he might have locked-in-syndrome, where he is fully aware and is just not able to move or communicate. And she's right.

And then there's Cassie, victim of a hit and run and in a coma - in the bed next to Frank, where he is able to hear and sometimes see all that happens around Cassie.

This story kept my interest and kept me guessing right up to the end. There was also some great information about different types of comas.

I received this book from Harper Collins through Edelweiss in the hopes that I would read it and leave an unbiased review.",1517097600,4
6233,1079,1697,"In Sempera power comes from time; the poor have their time drained from them through their blood and the rich consume the blood irons with their cup of tea to be able to live for hundreds of years. This highly original fantasy concept is made even more fascinating by the fairy tale of the Alchemist and Sorcerer that runs throughout; two magical beings that supposedly started with the power play of controlling time.

Whether fictional or based on true events, the young Jules lives on the wrong side of the power struggle as a poor servant in the household of the rich Gerlings. She lived on the Everless estate as a child and after being forced to leave she never forgot about the boys she grew up with, kind Roan Gerling and his wicked brother Liam. So when she returns it doesn't take long for her to reconnect with Roan.

Except Roan is engaged to be married to Ina Gold, the girl who will inherit the throne when the Queen steps down. But Ina and the Queen arriving at Everless is only the start of Jules' problems...

The fantasy genre has exploded within young adult in recent years and while initially it wasn't one I thought was for me, there are plenty of excellent reads that have convinced me otherwise, such as Caraval, A Shiver of Snow and Sky and Red Queen. However, having such a stellar catalogue of books for comparison, Everless had a lot to live up to. Luckily it exceeded all my expectations, and then some!

After reading the blurb and having a vague idea what the book would be about I was intrigued by the workings of how blood could extend or decrease someone's time on earth, but it was the cracking story and feisty protagonist that kept me hooked throughout. There was so much going on with Jules and Roan, Jules and Liam, Jules and Ina and then there was the whole Alchemist and Sorcerer storyline too, creating an absolute whirlwind of a reading adventure and I loved every second of it.

Everless was so interesting and different that it constantly took me by surprise. I didn't see some of the biggest revelations coming, especially in regards to Roan and Liam and I really enjoyed that level of suspense that came with it. I did not like that it ended on a massive cliffhanger, but when a story is *this* gripping I'll give it the benefit of the doubt  This is definitely one series I'll be eagerly anticipating the next installment for!

4.5 stars",1517097600,5
6234,833,1697,"All in all, I really liked Everless, and I loved the concept! I've heard it compared to the movie In Time, which I've never seen, so it was a really unique plot to me, which I loved. I was hooked right away, and I found the book really easy to read. The pacing was great, and I never found myself getting bored.

I also loved the characters and the character development -  I had some theories pretty early in the book, and I was right about some of them, but there were also some twists in the book which I didn't see coming but totally loved!

The one qualm I had with the book was that SO many of the issues could have been resolved with communication! For example, the main character Jules has always heard about her dad talk about how she needs to avoid Everless, and then specifically tells her never to let the queen see her or touch her, but never tells her WHY, so naturally being a teenage girl, she takes it upon herself to find out. If he'd just told her from the beginning, many of the plot points would have been non-issues. I know the lack of communication was needed in order to drive the plot in a specific way, but I felt it could have been done differently, and I would have liked it better - lack of communication that causes issues are always a pet peeve for me in books!

All in all, I loved the book and rated it 4.5 stars! I can't wait for the sequel!",1517097600,4

The Child Finder is written in a dual perspective format, that of Naomi and a child.  The biggest problem that I had with the story surrounded the abilities of the child, for the simple matter that he formative years of educational instruction were cut short.  I found it hard to believe that she would be that intelligent and composed despite being placed in adverse conditions for three years.

6240,108,594,"Annihilation is a book I've heard nothing but amazing things about. It's short, it's atmospheric, it's engaging, it's mysterious-- everyone I know who has read it has completely raved about its magic. I was so excited to pick this book up. Little did I know this was NOT going to turn out how I expected

Let's start with these characters. Our troupe is a collection of 6 women. I was thrilled to have an all-female cast! Yet, that bubble was quickly popped. While we might have 6 women, they are completely trope puppets with no personality. The limited dialogue they do share is horrible. It felt like they were early AI bots reading cue cards in an attempt to affect human interaction.

The book is dripping atmospheric writing. But the writing is SO atmospheric I couldn't visualize a single thing. There are no references to the world as we know it, so it's hard to place the setting. The closest things to our reality I can peg are things like flashlights. I don't see pictures in my head, so overly descriptive writing tends to bore me. But at least I understand what the author is trying to share. In this case, I felt like I spent the whole novel unable to understand what was happening; lost, bored, and detached.

This leads me to the hook, or the lack there-of. The premise of the book seems to be around trying to solve the mystery of Area X. And yet, never once did I care about Area X. There was nothing which piqued my interest. I think I might have been intrigued if VanderMeer had not tried so hard.

In the end, it's obvious that VanderMeer's works just aren't for me. Maybe I'll be willing to try his other series at some point, but The Southern Reach and I are done for good.",1517097600,1
6241,929,1792,"I enjoyed every page of this philosophical and scientific study of our greatest friends on the planet. As I love and study trees anyway I would be interested to know how a non-specialist feels after reading the book. Some line drawings of trees are included.

The author was a forester in Germany for a couple of decades but gave up the job in order to care for ancient woodland. Forestry is concerned with planting the desired kind of tree and felling it for wood. The woodland is quite a different proposition.

As the author explains, in order to live for centuries a tree must grow very slowly. We can understand that short lived species like birch take advantage of light in clearings and grow fast. But young trees, specifically beech as the Central European dominant tree, need to grow in shade to lay down really strong wood. As I live in Ireland I see more of oak as the dominant forest and beeches are naturalised plantings. So this book focusing on oak and beech was very interesting, with pines, alders, willow, spruce and silver fir in their appropriate surroundings.

A good deal of the discussion is about invisible life and chemicals - the microbes, fungi and tiny life in the soil, the chemicals emitted by trees, which include terpenes that make water droplets twice as likely to form in the air. Just by absorbing moisture and re-transpiring it the trees can bring rain inland from coastal areas, and the cooling effect they have on the land makes a moister microclimate for them. This backs up what I was told decades ago by farmers in central Ireland who availed of grants to plant trees - that they seemed to draw the rain.

Climate change is affecting which trees survive where, and in the past a slow forest creep by birds carrying seeds or wind blowing them, was enough to help a forest move. Now the climate is changing too rapidly so tree planters will need to consider future generations.

And the fascinating facts, all backed by studies, include stumps being excavated in Switzerland which seemed in good condition but turned out to be 14,000 years old; trees using chemical scents to warn other trees of leaf-chewing pests; trees feeding one another sugar through root networks, dubbed the wood wide web.

This book is well translated from the German, which accounts for some occasional curiosities, like a bird called a nutcracker which probably means a nuthatch. The foreword by Tim Flannery drew praise from news journalist Henry McDonald when I showed him the book: he loved the first line, ""We read in fairy tales of trees with human faces, trees that can talk, and sometimes walk.""
A final note is from Professor of forest ecology in Toronto, Dr Suzanne Simard.

Anna Fox,our protagonist suffers from agoraphobia resulting from a devastating and initially undisclosed incident that has damaged her deeply.  The major players are drawn with depth and breadth portraying people I could identify with or against and gave me serious skin in the game.  A successful author once said the writer's job is to get the hero up a tree and then set the tree on fire. A.J. Finn truly sets that tree burning. The first quarter of the book introduces us to the major players growing tension slowly but steadily-you know the drill.  By the 60% mark I was fully invested and rooting for Anna.  Things go from bad to worse and her back gets firmly slammed against the wall.  A.J. Finn's writing works because of the passion he brings to the table because he has suffered from the same affliction.

Reading about their lives on the charming island and their friends Kerensa and Reuben's outlandish Christmas festivities certainly got me in the festive mood. Every scene Neil was in was a sheer joy, and I really love Reuben in this book especially as well, despite his self-centered, privileged outlook on life.

However, while looking like a sweet and bubbly novel on the cover, there are some serious topics discussed within this novel that I feel were kind of brushed away towards the end to create a happily ever after ending for both Polly and Huckle, and Kerensa and Reuben. There would still be some implications to the journeys they went on in this book and it's a shame these weren't dealt with more realistically.

Despite this though I did really enjoy the novel overall. I mean, with Polly's gorgeous bakes running throughout, Neil being mischievous, Huckle being gorgeous, Reuben being hilarious, and Christmas in the air, how can this book not be a seasonal delight?

This is as close to a representation of me that I've ever seen in a YA novel. In spite of what the synopsis describes, this is not a book that focuses heavily on murder and mystery. Mostly you are at a prep school where a murder has occurred and our main character is interested in true crime. You get so see Stevie experience a little homesickness and worry about boys and making friends. I really liked this because a lot of detective/mystery novels surrounding teens seem to completely ignore the fact that they are just teenagers and have other responsibilities. There are flashbacks between 1936 and present day than give you pieces of the puzzle. Its very E. Lockhart style where you get all of the pieces but the one that fits everything together is left until the end. With that being said, you are juggling a lot of characters between 1936 and present day and it was a little difficult to keep track of them all at first.

6258,1079,284,"Myths and legends have always been some of my favourite stories to devour, however the majority I grew up with were based on Greek and Roman tales, with a dash of Egyptian gods thrown in. I knew very little about the Norse mythologies which have risen in popularity due to the successful Marvel comic books and associated blockbuster films. I am now familiar with Thor, Loki, Odin and Sif, but beyond their world-saving / destroying antics I was still pretty clueless, and I was interested in learning more.

Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology came at the perfect time (and I'm sure the publishers were very aware they'd be able to ride on Marvel's success with this). Detailing some of the most well-preserved tales from the Norse gods, we start at the beginning of time and the creation of worlds, and go all the way to the end when Ragnarok destroys it all.

Along the way we get to know various pivotal characters from Norse myths, the impact they have on the world, the way they die... True to mythical form there are bizarre relationships, feuds and monsters and I loved it. I'm hoping Neil Gaiman will take a crack at uncovering more lost Nordic myths because if they're all as fascinating as the ones already included in this book then we'd be in for a real treat!

I do like the fact that he has not restricted himself to war, but has included aspects of violence like domestic violence, rape, violence against children etc

One: all the data is Western. For whatever reason, there is no analysis of Asia (including the Middle East), Africa, Latin America or Australia! This is practically the entire world!

Now, to give an example.  Hindus and Muslims lived together for hundreds of years in India. Between 1858 and 1947, the British rulers serve to drive a wedge between them, and this exists today. If you look at the rise of Hindu fundamentalism in India, you will see this. Some aver that the seeds of modern Muslim terrorism were sown by the British from 1858. Is this true? An analysis would have been most insightful.

Two: the West has a different growth trajectory, demographic profile, and culture from those of the other parts of the world.  is the overcrowding, and lack of jobs in countries like my own (India) partially responsible for the rise in child rape, for instance, along with the collapse of institutions like the law and order machinery?

While I cannot expect Steven Pinker to do an analysis of each country (that would be unfair to him), I would have liked to have seen a broader based analysis.

Notwithstanding this little gripe of mine, it is indeed a very good book.",1517184000,4

6268,121,569,"This book made me question a lot of things - firstly, about why it is so hyped, and secondly, what are others seeing that I am missing out? I genuinely had to ask some of my friends what they thought of the book, because I saw so many high-rated reviews for it (not from my friends but others I follow on GR) and I mostly got 'eh I didn't like it much either' kind of answers. Maybe it was the time in which it released - the era of dystopias, but this is more like a romance set in a dystopic world than a true dystopia. Honestly, this book takes the love triangle to a cringe-worthy level, and WAIT I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE LOVED THIS BOOK BUT I GOTTA GET MY FEELINGS OUT IN A RANT before I can even continue with what I actually liked. Buckle your seat belts, darlings, because this one is going to be gif-fed up!

Firstly, I gotta ask - WHY? Why the focus on the romance in a dystopia? I am not one for sticking to genre conventions - heck, I love when books subvert them and introduce some new elements. But the 'new elements' in this weren't exactly new. There's the childhood friend who is now a hottie trope. Bad boy with (probably) a heart of gold trope (We'll come to that LATER OH BOY). No, what my main problem was with this book sticking its toe out of genre boundaries, is that it does it in the name of the most irritating love triangle. AND I LIKE LOVE TRIANGLES! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!

Also, how in this messed up world where people don't have proper living conditions, is the romance the main conflict of the story? It is not even a dystopia-that-looks-like-a-utopia kind of plot that love triangles are usually featured in! The world is dying, there is a fascist government ruling over them, and the first thought of these teens is whether they can get some. (It is not my imagination - there are literally scenes where the making out just happens, due to Circumstances That Just Need to Insert a Hot Makeout Scene) The world-building is sorely lacking in this book - there is barely an explanation given for how the Reestablishment came about, how it is all co-ordinated, how the resistance is not able to do any damage.

Adam is this hero complex guy who liked Juliette when she was younger because she acted soooo good, lay down while other kids were tormenting her and stuff. He, of course, defended her and beat up the other kids, but his double standards are such that he admired her for not fighting back?! The romance with him would have been more believable if there was some actual development, but considering it is all silence glances in the start and very little conversation on her part, I'm declaring this as insta-love and a case of I-need-human-touch-STAT. I get that Juliette didn't have anyone to touch for years, but that doesnt mean his touch will immediately comfort her in every circumstance. It is more like an excuse to have them kissing again and again.
Also his actions don't make much sense in the context of what he does have to lose from helping her - don't get me wrong, I liked that he didn't turn out to be shady or a backstabbing betrayer, but I also don't see why he would risk so much with barely a plan.

And the writing doesn't help matters, really. Sure, there is the fact that this is narrated as Juliet's thoughts, so we get a very close understanding of what she is going through, and some crossed out sections where we see her replacing what she wants to say with what she actually says. But why did there have to be so many METAPHORS?! I get that Juliet loved books a lot, but I have read like over 2000 books in my life, and I don't talk inside my head like everything is inexplicable without a weird metaphor attached to it. It gets too much at time, like body creaking like a staircase? Also, another weird quirk is sometimes numbers are used instead of the words for numbers, which kinda ruins the flow in a sentence. And this may be minor, but why the heck is Juliette gasping so much? This girl is made up of being surprised all the freaking time.

Adam lifts her up? Gasp! Castle agrees with her on something? Gasp! Warner being his usual terrible self? Gasp! Adam kisses her? You guessed it right - Gasp! (Actually the last one can be forgiven but I'm not in the mood)

And let's move on to the other part of the triangle -Warner - by the way, does it count as love triangle if one guy is just being plain obsessed with her even when she is like 'eww no dude get away from me'? He literally thinks she is like him, and they have a CONNECTION and she just HAS TO BE AT HIS SIDE as he rules over his corner of the world.

Dude, why are you so dense? He constantly invades her personal space and treats her like a possession than a human being capable with her own agency. How is he even a love interest? Also, this book had his short story attached, to which I am only going to say: nah, doesn't excuse what you did, you ass. He knows Juliette was psychologically tortured, and his idea to make her better is to psychologically torture her more? How is he even justifying torturing her considering what he himself went through?

Finally, let's get to the parts that I did like - I liked the getting into Juliette's head way of narrating this book. She is a character kept in the dark (literally and metaphorically) so she sort of reveals the terrible world as she goes through the book. She also shows resourcefulness, and a hint of grey morality when it comes to getting things done (still, stay away from her, Warner!). But what I really liked was in the second half, when we get to meet the X-Men other people like her. I mean, she is basically a stand-in for Rogue, and there's this secret underground bunker where other mutantspowered people live, so I was excited about that, and what that would mean for this story. But it does arrive like pretty later in the story, so my enjoyment of that was already affected by my irritation with the love triangle.

Overall, this is a book that I wanted to love, majorly because I love books about powered people but the focus and main storyline of the book had me disappointed in it.",1517184000,3

Stevie Bell is obsessed with the Ellingham case. This is what gets her accepted to the Ellingham Academy, where she plans to solve the cold case that the school has. But as she works on the cold case, another mystery comes up when the original jokester, Truly Devious, makes a return.....
Y'all this book was super wild. There were two mysteries going on that made it difficult to guess who the killer was. Johnson also barely gives you any clues which also makes it hard to guess who the culprit is. She times it in a great way and because of that, I was thankful. One of my pet peeves of thrillers is being able to tell who did it, so I applaud Johnson for not making it easy on me.
I also loved the characters. Stevie was so relatable. If you come to my house on any given day, the tv is on and it's on Oxyen or ID. I love True Crime and I find myself watching it all the time. I could definitely understand her wanting to be in everyone's business lol All of the others were interesting as well, which made the story so much more enjoyable.
The only thing I didn't care for was the length and the ""romance."" I wasn't sure that it was neccessary, but I can tell it was at the ""ending."" (I'll get there in a minute lol) And I can't help but think that it was a touch too long. I'm not sure how to explain it because I think it was too long, but I also think it wasn't long enough to give us a real ending? I guess it was a bit too drawn out.
Overall, there was so much more that I wanted to find out about this book! I can honestly say I am excited to find out about the rest of the series and I usually never say that with books that have cliff-hangers. This is one sequel I will definitely be waiting on in 2019!",1517184000,4

6275,455,1730,"Pair a terrific family story with food, and you can bet it's a book I will be reading. Susan Wiggs' Family Tree tells the tale of Annie Rush, who grew up on a family-owned maple farm in Vermont, and dreams of moving away to pursue a life making documentaries about food.

Annie becomes a big success when she makes a documentary about Martin, a handsome man who owns a food truck in New York City. Her documentary becomes a viral sensation, and Annie ends up producing a hugely popular food show with Martin as the star.

They have a busy, happy life in Los Angeles until a tragedy hits, and Annie ends up back in Switchback, Vermont having to start all over again. The story moves back and forth in time, as we see Annie as a teenage girl, working long hours during maple syrup season, cooking with her beloved Gran, and falling in love with a transfer student.

Wiggs writes such intriguing, real characters, I felt like I knew them as friends. Annie's high school love, Fletcher, is such a great guy. He lives with his single dad, and more often than not is the adult in that family, even more so when his dad faces a traumatic event.

We learn so much in this book too. Wiggs shows the reader how a maple farm works, and how whiskey is distilled (through Annie's friend's family business). I found that endlessly fascinating.

The scenes set in the hospital and rehabilitation center were so well done, as we see how the daily challenges of relearning everything we take for granted can be so stressful.

 I love descriptions of food, and there are plenty in here to savor. Annie's rustic cheddar, apple and beer soup that she made in a high school competition had me salivating. Gran's Cabot grated cheese sandwich with spring onions, radishes and mayo on thick bread would be perfect with that.

 The description of the Thanksgiving feast that Annie brought to Fletcher and his dad had my stomach grumbling- ""free range, organic chicken roasted in sage butter, homemade sweet potato hush puppies with sriracha ketchup, dressing with wild mushrooms and walnuts, garlic mashed potatoes and gravy, brandied cranberry compote and pumpkin pie in a maple pecan shell."" Oh my goodness.

Annie's story touched my heart. She is an ambitious, determined, smart woman who loves her family, and when she needed them most, they were there for her. I didn't want to put Family Tree down, and I stayed up way too late last night finishing it. I didn't want it to end, and hope that Susan Wiggs brings us more of Annie's story. If you like the television show This Is Us, then put Family Tree on your TBR list.",1517184000,5

6280,656,1390,"This book is intense. Very intense. I found I couldn't read it for more than an hour at a time because it just tore my heart in two.

Their mother, Julie, belongs to a Pentecostal-snake-handling church. Unadulterated evil emanates from the church and its pastor, invading the souls of its parishionerssomething only Jess appears able to see. To tell more of the story would be a spoiler.

The set up for About that Kiss was fun and different - and it worked in the favor of Joe and Kylie as a way to bring them together and work through their thoughts/feelings.  Joe hadn't called Kylie after a kiss and she was left with all sorts of feelings about that fact.  But when Kylie finds herself in trouble of sorts, Joe is the first one to step up and step in to help her - and in doing so she finds herself with more feelings.

One of my favorite things about this series is the closeness of the group of characters - even when they are going through serious things - there's always a little bit of fun and silliness to add levity.  But there is also that feeling of ""Don't screw this up"" because when you live in such a small town - where everyone knows everything - you are always being watched.  I love that little bit of angst added because it sort of builds on the story - a what happens if things don't work out - how do you move on with the rest of your friends if they feel you are in the wrong.  Thankfully, Joe and Kylie do find their happiness and work through her trouble as well, and they do it in such a fun sort, growing closer along the way.

6286,1080,949,"I have been interested in reading this book for a long time because I love the English language and all its formalities. I am a grammar Nazi--and a punctuation Nazi and spelling Nazi for that matter. So needless to say, this book seemed right up my alley. And it was . . . kind of.

This book was, at times, funny, and I literally laughed out loud at some of her comments and examples. But I also got the feeling that Truss's vigor and violence were not just for show. ""If you still persist in writing 'Good food at it's best,' you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave."" I, like her, am also a stickler for punctuation, but that's going too far; I simply shake my head at people who punctuate like that instead of wishing for their demise.

Since Eats, Shoots & Leaves was written by a Brit and therefore includes British language rules, there were quite a few differences in how she writes compared to how Americans write, and she discusses those differences in her book, which I found to be helpful. Similarly, she has that dry sense of humor true of most Brits, and I only sometimes connected with it. Some examples and jokes she made were too much for me, and I was left wondering what their appeal was. This is probably the biggest disconnect I had with the book: there came a point where even I was thinking, calm down lady, it's not that big of a deal.

One disagreement I did have with her was in the history of the use of the apostrophe. Her rant about the apostrophe's many tasks is unnecessary, as the apostrophe has one main task that all other tasks fall under: to indicate omission. Even when used to show a possessive in a singular noun (e.g. ""the girl's book""), the apostrophe still indicates an omission. Historically (as I learned in my English language classes at university), the suffix -es was added to words to show possession, and nowadays the apostrophe stands in place of the ""e"" in -es (e.g. ""the girles book"" became ""the girl's book""). Whenever an apostrophe is used in English, it almost always indicates an omission of something.

Overall, this book was a nice refresher of the rules of English punctuation while providing lovely examples of historical use and humor along the way. Somewhere in the chaos of her rants, Truss actually does explain the proper uses of the comma, apostrophe, period, ellipsis, dash, bracket, quotation mark, exclamation point, question mark, hyphen, and even the interrobang. While not a book I would read again, Eats, Shoots & Leaves is still one I would recommend to any over-the-top English language fanatic like myself.

6288,53,365,"An Empire has begun to decline and one man had produced a plan to shorten the resulting Dark Age and found a Second Empire.  Isaac Asimov based his Hugo Best All-Time Series on this premise, one man setting up a Foundation for the future of mankind but not telling his successors about how to bring the plan to fruition.

Foundation is not one story, but several connected together because of the grand plan by Hari Seldon who mathematically deduced the decline of the Galactic Empire and its future fall then came up with a plan to reduce the resulting Dark Age to only a 1000 years.  Three of the five stories featured the two standout characters of the volume:  Salvor Hardin, the point-of-view character in The Encyclopedists and The Mayors, and Hober Mallow, the point-of-view character of The Merchant Princes.  It is through these two characters the reader gets an understanding of the political and social situations going on as the Empire declines and the Seldons Foundation politically evolve to meet the conditions known as Seldon Crisis.

Although Foundation is an interconnected collection of short stories, combined they create a history of a far off future of a declining Empire and an outpost meant to build up a future Second Empire for the betterment of all men.  While some might think space science fiction is all lasers and space battles, Isaac Asimov showed that it could be political, religious, and economic forces on a large scale used by individuals to pave the way for a better future.  It is because of this that many consider this a classic and frankly I cant disagree.",1517184000,4
6289,905,1798,"SYNOPSIS:

Kittys modern story of broken love, denial, and resolution takes place as she cleans out and fixes up an isolated lakeside cabin inherited from an unknown grandfather. Running from a cheating husband, she turns her back on both him and her emotions by digging into the project of making the cabin inhabitable after 30 years of neglect.

Who was he? Why did her family tell her that her grandparents were dead before she was born when that wasn't the case? And how did a Faberge pendant with real jewels get under the rotting outdoor staircase?

Those are the questions that open the door to the different time and place of her grandfather Dmitris life. Love, war, passion, regret, and resignation are the themes of his story that intertwines with one of the Russian Romanov sisters during World War I, the subsequent Bolshevik revolution, and picking up the pieces of his shattered soul to create a new life from the ashes of total loss.

REVIEW:

Kittys story in modern times is superficial and banal in comparison to her grandfathers. Its standard boiler plate and not much more. As a stand-alone, I give it 2 stars at best.

It took a big leap of faith to accept that the glint of a small gold pendant laying in the dirt under a rotting outdoor staircase after THIRTY YEARS of snow and rain would catch her eye. Please.

In addition, the resolution of her broken love story came way too easy. A long string of unread emails from her husband Tom, one letter read by Kitty, and no real conversation brings resolution? Im sorry, but it goes against Kittys character profile as set up by the author.

Then there was the sex scene at the end of Kittys and Toms first meeting after their break up. It literally made me groan out loud. Not because it was poorly written, but because it was (again) so superficial and boilerplate. After their dinner conversation of reconnection, a vulnerable exchange that ignites a spark of deep recognition on both sides would have more than sufficed as a reunion that opens the door to rebuilding a future together. The readers imagination could take it from there. As written, however, it only made me want to brush away Kittys story like you would a pesky fly buzzing around your ear.

Dmitris story, however, is in a whole other league.

The multi-textured backdrop for a complex protagonist with clear motivations makes it rich and rewarding on many levels. His story will stay with me for a long time.

Without giving spoilers, the intimate look it gives you into the Russian side of World War I and the social ramifications of their revolution in the individual  lives of the common manas well as those of Tsar Nicholas Romanov familywill break your heart. There were moments when I gasped out loud and my hand flew to my face to cover my mouth as events unfolded.

Insights to Dmitris motivations are honest and deep. The author perfectly captures the pure loveas well as raw angstrunning rampant in Dmitris psyche as he struggles with his choices and their ramifications in a world thats falling to pieces around him.

How the author wove in the clues of the past to Kitty in the future was elegant and satisfying. All in all, I give Dmitris story a solid 5 stars.

Put the stories together, the book earns 4 stars. But only because Dmitri, Tatiana, and Rosa carry the day.

I loved the concept of this novel, and I think Josh Malerman delivered on that concept well. The writing was thoroughly engaging. The story is told back and forth between the past and the future, and the transition between time periods was well timed. The pacing kept me entertained and constantly searching for new answers to new questions.

We follow Malorie and her two children over the span of four years as they try to blindly (literally) navigate this world. They are trapped in a safe-house until one day when Malorie decides to leave in search of humanity and a better life. She must travel over twenty miles completely blind, relying only on the hearing abilities of the two kids with her.

The main question I had while reading this book was what is it exactly that is outside? What can the people not stand to look at? While the book does not address the answer to this question, I found an interview with Josh Malerman where he mentions what concept led to this book's creation, and thus what the thing outside essentially is. And I was blown away! I highly recommend looking it up after you finish the book.

I didn't originally intend to, but I ended up listening to most of this book on audio. I chose to because, in the book, the characters rely solely on their sense of hearing instead of sight, and listening on audio produced a similar experience for myself. The descriptions are all about how things sound, and that impact is amplified when you're hearing the story instead of reading it.

I've heard Bird Box described as a horror novel, but I didn't think it was particularly scary. It was suspenseful and eerie, but not terrifying to me, although it might be to some. This is a tiny, quick book, but it pulls you right into the story and won't let go until you reach the last page.

Margaret Atwood brilliantly understood the underlying societal issues of religious self-righteousness and authoritarianism and projected them into a hellish future. That future today seems to be getting closer to a divided America than ever before. No wonder this book urgently speaks to so many of us, both men and women,  as we witness the wanton undoing of facts, ""news,"" and democratic institutions in the name of money, power, nationalism, and narcissism. This too was the exclusionary vision of Nazi Germany. In the end, however, as Atwood writes, this time shall pass and become a mere obscure historical footnote, if, in fact, the world survives a poisoned environment and male aggression. Margaret Atwood is well deserving of all honors bestowed upon her. Some say this book is a radical feminist leftist anti-religious screed. I think it's a warning about what has been and what will be if people refuse to educate themselves and continue to be indifferent to their social obligations as citizens. Passivity breeds dictators and bullies. Mayday. Mayday! Time to resist!",1517184000,5

6298,129,1799,"I'm slowly getting into Highlander-type books and I couldn't resist the synopsis of this one...even if that cover cannot be taken seriously.

I love love loved Edith and Niels. She's smart and maybe a bit sassy. He's loyal and maybe a bit gruff. Together they have a great rapport, amazing chemistry, and are super easy to root for. All of his brothers are hilarious and I enjoyed the banter between the siblings.

Plot wise, it was entertaining. I liked the poisoning plot line and how Edith didn't allow anyone to push her to the side when it came to figuring things out. My main complaint is that I wanted a bit more at the end. The last chapter was sweet and tied things up, but I would have loved to see more of something from the future.

Overall, it was a quick read with great characters. I'm definitely going to look into other books from the series.

Note: I'm not putting this on the rape shelf because there wasn't an actual scene of rape, but towards the end there is a lot of talk about it.

Frieda Kline, a noted psychologist, now turned herself into a detective as well so she could find why Dean Reeve was after her and her family again.

Incidents and murders were coming too close to home for Frieda.  She couldn't figure out the message Dean was trying to get to Frieda, but Frieda knew it was a message of evil, sadness, and death. But was it really Dean?  Was he really still alive as Frieda and only Frieda believed or could there be a copycat added to the mix?

6301,756,138,"Superheroes have always been Leia Birch Briggs weakness. One tequila-soaked night at a comics convention, the usually level-headed graphic novelist is swept off her barstool by a handsome and anonymous Batman.

  It turns out the caped crusader has left her with more than just a nice, fuzzy memory. Shes having a baby boyan unexpected but not unhappy development in the thirty-eight year-olds life. But before Leia can break the news of her impending single-motherhood (including the fact that her baby is biracial) to her conventional, Southern family, her step-sister Rachels marriage implodes. Worse, she learns her beloved ninety-year-old grandmother, Birchie, is losing her mind, and shes been hiding her dementia with the help of Wattie, her best friend since girlhood.

  Leia returns to Alabama to put her grandmothers affairs in order, clean out the big Victorian that has been in the Birch family for generations, and tell her family that shes pregnant. Yet just when Leia thinks shes got it all under control, she learns that illness is not the only thing Birchies been hiding. Tucked in the attic is a dangerous secret with roots that reach all the way back to the Civil War. Its exposure threatens the familys freedom and future, and it will change everything about how Leia sees herself and her sister, her son and his missing father, and the world she thinks she knows.

My Thoughts: The first person voice of Leia Birch Briggs brings the reader into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Almost-Sisters-A-Novel/dp/B01M3QYT9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Almost Sisters: A Novel</a>, the story of a young woman with a unique perspective on life; a woman who, as a girl, was often overshadowed by her stepsister Rachel, the blond pretty one. Rachel, who has a picture perfect life, but who is so determined to hold onto what is hers that she bit Leia when they were toddlers for calling Keith, Rachels father, daddy.

A girl like Leia has to carve out her own unique world and stand proud when others do not understand her. Even with Leias success, Rachel condescends and refers to her work as your drawings.

So when Rachel starts having marital problems, I wanted to smirk a little.

Meanwhile, in Birchville, Leias grandmother Birchie is going through some medical issues, so Leia, newly pregnant, and not having told anyone about her situation, drives to the rescue.

A lovely story that captivated me from the very beginning, I wanted to root for them all, even Rachel, eventually. The flavor of the South drew me in, as each character revealed his or her unique Southern charmand sometimes meanness.

I couldn't wait to find out what would happen to them all. Would Leia and her baby daddy reconnect? Would Rachel soften up her hard, mean shell? And how would Birchies secret change their lives? 5 stars.",1517270400,5
6302,129,1800,"I enjoyed the cast of characters from the first book in this series, so I was pretty eager to get to Jacks story.

Love love loved Katie. Shes smart and sassy and I love how she handles Jack. Jack is a great guy. Hes charming and loyal and doesnt realize how fantastic he is. Together they have a whole lot of chemistry and a bunch of sweetness too.

Plot wise, it was a bit more drama-y and slightly darker than I was expecting, but it was easy to overlook because there was so much communication between Katie and Jack. I was so happy to see them talking as much as they did.

Overall, it was a quick read with characters I loved and a perfect epilogue. I cant wait to read the next one.

6303,129,1801,"I desperately wanted to love this book and Im actually wondering if 3 stars is too high of a rating.

First off: major trigger warnings for physical and mental abuse as well as homophobia.

I couldn't connect with Evan. He seems like a good guy in a horrible situation, but it felt like I never actually got to know him. I hated Evans mom and his dad isn't any better as he just lets it happen. As much as I wanted to love the romance part of things, it was very dramatic and over the top.

Plot wise, it was a rollercoaster of nothing. I was on edge because I was expecting a horrible beating every time I turned the page. Its basically a slice of time where nothing happens except abuse. All sorts of people know Evan is getting abused and no one does anything. Literally no one helps.

Lastly, I seriously struggled with the rhythm of the story. Everything was I did this and then this and then this happened before I did this. It got old reaaaaalllly quick.

Overall, it had a lot of promise and judging by the high reviews, Im in the minority. Obviously this book just wasn't for me.

6304,214,1802,"After reading nearly 40 books by Jennifer L. Armentrout, her ability to jump from genre to genre, effortlessly creating one captivating story after another, never ceases to amaze me. With Moonlight Sins, the first book in her de Vincent Series, the author gives readers a romantic suspense novel with a different feel than many her previous books. Its more mature, a bit more risqu, and definitely a darker tone  think Twin Peaks meets Rebecca. This book its twisted. Its creepy. Its all kinds of ****ed up. From start to finish, Moonlight Sins will keep you on edge, waiting with baited breath as you discover the new secrets that are unveiled with every chapter.

To say the de Vincent family is dysfunctional would be a severe understatement. The brothers are infamous not only for their sexual exploits, but for the mound of skeletons they have in their familys closet. With the threat of a family curse, constant visits from the cops due to one scandal or another, and a possibly haunted house, things are never dull at the de Vincent mansion. The arrival of Julia Hughes as a newly-hired live-in nurse causes a stir, especially once she discovers that the man she recently became intimately acquainted with is none other than one of her employers, Lucian de Vincent.

After leaving her job, her home, and her old life behind to start over in a new place, Julia Hughes is understandably dumbfounded to learn that the handsome stranger she took home from the bar was in fact a wealthy playboy whose family has long been the subject of outlandish rumors and tabloid fodder not just in their home state of Louisiana, but across the country as well. Working in such close quarters brings the simmering sexual tension between Julia and Luc the surface, igniting a spark thats more and more difficult to ignore with every teasing, innuendo-laden comment made by Luc. His devil-may-care attitude, good looks, irresistible charm, and relentless quest to seduce Julia are a potent combination  one that breaks down Julias defenses and draws her deeper into his world.

Packed with suspense, intrigue, and sub-plots that include the mysterious return of a long-lost sibling and a possible murder, the narrative of Moonlight Sins is a fast-paced thriller thatll keep you on your toes. There are so many events occurring in such a short amount of time that will have you amazed, thrilled, worried, shocked, and a whirlwind of other emotions. This book will have your pulse pounding and cause your hands to anxiously clutch your Kindle as you unravel the many mysteries of the de Vincent family. With enough resolution to keep readers satisfied but also enough unanswered questions to have you left wanting more, I cant wait to get my hands on the next book in the series.

6305,120,930,"Mention Neville Chamberlain and Munich in the same breath today, and you're likely to elicit a grimace. The agreement in 1938 between the British Prime Minister and Adolf Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia is regarded as one of the most shameful and tragic events of the 20th century. But is it fair to condemn Chamberlain without understanding his motivation or the context of the times? The British thriller author Robert Harris has been exploring that question for thirty years. The result is his new novel, Munich. The book is not an alternative history like his popular novel, Fatherland. It's fact-based historical fiction.

Why did Neville Chamberlain go to Munich?
As Harris paints the picture, Chamberlain's actions in 1938 were not just understandable but possibly admirable. He was not naive about Hitler's intentions. His rush to sign the pact with Nazi Germany responded to almost universal desire to avoid war, the difficulty of refuting Hitler's logic about absorbing the Sudetenland Germans into the Reich, and Chamberlain's passionate desire to avoid repeating the slaughter of World War I. (He had been too old to serve in the military then.)

Harris based his novel on extensive reading about the Munich conference and the principal characters involved in it, which he details in a long bibliography in his Acknowledgements. Moreover, recent research suggests that if Britain and France had gone to war against Germany in 1938, the result would have been devastating. It's true that the Nazi invasion of France and the Low Countries in May 1940 and the Battle of Britain that followed were disastrous for the Allies. However,the nearly two-year delay Chamberlain achieved at Munich allowed Britain to equip and staff the Royal Air Force just enough to stave off a German invasion of the island in September 1940. Harris implies that Chamberlain was fully conscious that war would come. He sought only to gain time.

An historical novel wrapped in a thriller
Harris builds his story around two central characters, one English, the other German. Hugh Legat is the most junior of Neville Chamberlain's three Private Secretaries; he serves essentially as a gofer but is pressed into service at times as an interpreter and, even more rarely, as a wordsmith. Paul von Hartmann holds a similarly junior post in the German Foreign Ministry; he despises the Nazis and has joined a conspiracy to depose Hitler. The two young men had been classmates and friends at Oxford. They'd last seen each other in 1932 on a vacation in Germany.

Von Hartmann has secured a document that proves Hitler's intention to expand Germany's borders through war regardless of any international agreements. With the help of his collaborators in the anti-Nazi conspiracy, he travels from Berlin to Munich in hopes of delivering the document directly to Neville Chamberlain. Through their connections in London, the conspirators have contrived to arrange for Legat to be assigned to attend the conference, too. Von Hartmann expected Legat to help him get to Chamberlain. Harris builds a suspenseful story around the effort to arrange that.

Historical figures in a fictional setting
Legat and von Hartmann are both fictional characters. However, many of the other figures portrayed in Munich are based on real men. Prominent among them are British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifaxand German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, as well as Chamberlain, Hitler, Mussolini, and French Premier Daladier. The author's portrayal of these historical figures is solidly grounded in his research.

About the author
Robert Harris is one of the most successful writers in the world today. Most of his work is historical fiction about World War II and Ancient Rome. Beginning with Fatherland in 1992, his novels also include The Ghost (adapted to film as The Ghost Writer) and the three novels in the Cicero trilogy.",1517270400,4
6306,566,1803,"WOW,  Just WOW!  Anyone who follows my reviews knows I read A LOT of books, but rarely do I want to cry at the end of book as much I as did this one - not because it was sad, but because it was over!  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book!  Ms. Heath has a way with words, she has the ability to draw a reader in and force them to become invested in her characters - their joy is your joy, their pain is your pain, their troubles become your troubles - it is a rare treat to find an author who has this talent and an amazing gift for anyone lucky enough to read the book.

This is the first book in the Sins for All Seasons Series, the series is centered around the Widow Ettie Trewlove and the children she raised, who are all illegitimate cast-offs.  Ms. Heath sets up the series and introduces us to the future characters, but never does it feel like this book is just a set up for the series, Mick Trewlove and Lady Aslyn Hastings are truly the stars and the main focus of the book.

Mick knows that the Duke of Hedley is his father and wants to be acknowledged as such.  He is a wealthy self-made man who literally pulled himself from the gutter and forged an empire.  But he longs for the respect and acceptance of the nobility, he is sure if his father would acknowledge their connection, doors would be opened to him.  He has written to the duke several times, but after responding that he has no bastard to the first letter, the duke has ignored him.  Mick wants his acknowledgement more than anything in the world and hatches a plan.  If the duke won't accept him, Mick will ruin his heir.

Lady Aslyn Hastings in the orphaned daughter of an earl and the ward of the Duke of Hedley.  She has lived with the family since she was a young child and though it has not been officially announced, she and everyone in society assume that she will marry Hedley's son and heir, the Earl of Kipwick and affectionately known as Kip.  Aslyn has been sheltered and knows little of the world, the duchess is a recluse and extremely over protective of her.  Aslyn longs for excitement and begs Kip to take her to Cremorne Gardens.  This is where Mick and Aslyn meet for the first time.

Mick along with his sister Fancy are at the gardens and ""happen"" to run into Kip and Aslyn.  Kip knows of Mick and longs to gain entrance to his brother Aiden's club - The Cerberus Club.  After a bit of friendly chatter, Mick tells Kip, he will take him to the club.  Meanwhile, Aslyn is mesmerized by Mick, never has she had such a reaction to a man and it makes her question her feelings for Kip.

Over the next few days, Mick enacts his plan and plays on Kip's weakness for gambling, he also begins to ""woo"" Aslyn.  He plans to steal her from Kip and bring Kip to ruin, thinking he will then be able to force the duke's hand.  What he didn't plan for was Aslyn or his reaction to her.

This is an amazing story, it is well written, flows wonderfully, there are secrets, betrayal, moments of wonder and joy, moments of immense heartache, steamy love scenes, shocking twists that have even bigger shocking twists and a truly beautiful soul-mate type love.  I cannot recommend this book enough, I will definitely be re-reading this one and cannot wait for the next book in the series.

6307,93,1778,"Jill Shalvis has certainly found her stride with this series now. While I liked the first few books in the series, I really feel like things are starting to feel like her older titles which I simply adore. ABOUT THAT KISS is the fifth book in the Heartbreaker Bay series and it features Joe and Kylie. At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like Joe. I don't really know why that is. I just went into the book thinking that he was going to be one of those stuck-up heroes so made a move on the heroine and would forever hold that scorching kiss between them forever. However, I quickly changed my mind about him. Joe was great. Sweet and fun, he turned out to be a great hero for Kylie.

Kylie was a character that I immediately liked. Shes a do-it-yourself kind of girl and I really liked that about her. Although she has be persuade, she also doesnt allow people to walk over her so when Joe comes in, intending to purchase a mirror she made for his sister, Molly, Kylie is quick to turn him down. Its only when she realized she needs his assistance that she goes hunting for him.

Simple yet effective, this story is one of my favorites in the series. I thought it was upbeat and fun, without trying too hard. It had the perfect balance of heart and humor and I really enjoyed the banter between these two. With each book in this series, I am beginning to enjoy the series more and more. So Im confident that Shalvis has found the key to writing a successful novel.",1517270400,4
6308,555,1803,"An amazing start to a new series by Lorraine.  This is a story that shows the class differences in England in the 1900's especially the way bastard children were treated.  There was a sharp divide between the rich and the poor.  If you were born into the Aristocracy you never mixed with the middle or poor classes.  What could a man born on the wrong side of the blanket and a young lady who was raised by a Duke and Duchess be to each other?

Mick Trewlove is a bastard who has worked his whole life towards one goal.  To make his father The Duke of Hedley acknowledge him as his son.  To get his father's attention he is in the process of ruining his legitimate son by encouraging his gambling habit and collecting his vowels and unentailed properties.  He also has plans to seduce the woman that his half-brother has plans to marry.  He does not count on the feelings that she awakens in him and the choices that he will have to make to keep her in his life.

Aslyn has always been loved and sheltered by the Duke and Duchess and has never questioned her life or the fact that she has been chosen for Kip, the Duke's son.  She has never traveled out of the safe environs of Mayfair.  One night Kip takes her to a Pleasure Garden and she is amazed at the variety of people mingling together.  She is especially intrigued by a man that Kip introduced her too,  Mick Trewlove is not like anyone she has ever met and she is fascinated by him.  After their first meeting, she cannot seem to stop herself from seeking him out and grows more and more attracted to him.  She realizes that she loves Kip like a brother and the feelings that she is developing for Mick are growing stronger and definitely not brotherly.

As the story progresses you think you know the whole truth and then the plot twist will blow you away!!! Lorraine draws you into a tale of a love between her characters that is tragic, lovely and will leave you smiling at the end.  What I really love about Lorraine's writing is that there are so many twists and turns to her stories and when you think that there is no way that this story can have a happy ending she surprises you with another turn to the story that you don't see coming.  I have every one of her books and I am a big fan who hopes she will always keep writing Historical Romance.  I highly recommend this book and cannot wait for the next one in the series.",1517270400,5
6309,808,1366,"Another Grisham novel ticked off my very long list!

The Brethren is not one of the author's best works. The pace is significantly slower, in some places, than his other novels. However, it still contains enough drama to keep the reader wanting to know what happens at the end. Grisham's books are also not easily skim read because the plot details are skillfully woven together and you might miss something important rendering the book nonsensical.

Trumble is a minimum security federal prison which houses relatively harmless (in terms of violence) criminals. Three former judges have established themselves as The Brethren and together they pass judgement on their fellow inmates, a sort-of jailhouse justice. When the opportunity presents itself, they expand to the outside with the help of Trevor, a corrupt and lazy lawyer. They begin an extortion scheme by tricking victims into believing they are conversing with young gay males then threatening to expose them to their family and friends. However, the time comes when they chance to mess with the wrong victim, someone with powerful friends who will stop at nothing to protect their client's reputation....

The novel contains the usual mixture of corruption at the heart of government, the judicial system and within the intelligence service. Unfortunately, the slightly seedy topic that has been chosen for this book leaves one feeling a little uncomfortable. Grisham does a good job of painting the victims as pathetic, helpless wretches at the mercy of their passions. He fails to consider the plight of their ever suffering wives and families because of their failure to keep their passions in check. God calls it lust, which is a sin. Grisham presents it as if they have been ensnared by life and are forever trapped, unable to move forward....poor creatures.

I note that this was published in 2000. I'm not sure whether it would receive as wide an audience now due to changing attitudes about homosexuality across the board.

That said, I always like the way Grisham draws out the deceit of wealth, and this novel is no exception:

He was selling his ethics, his standards, even his morals for money. Was his soul worth a million bucks? Too late now. The money was in the bank. He took a sip of beer and washed away the fading twinges of guilt

The reality is that burying our heads in the sand, or drinking away our guilt, won't help on Judgement Day when we all have to give God an account of our lives. In His mercy, God has given us consciences to regulate our behaviour so that we don't stack up offences against Him. It is good that Grisham's characters are fictional, but let's hope those reading them don't copy the behaviour.

This book has some swearing but it isn't strong or frequent, it has some details of lust and sexual feelings, but they aren't graphic. It has some references to violence but nothing significant.

My rating is due to the subject matter and the fact that there are better Grisham books out there.",1517270400,2
6310,70,1800,"Indecent Exposure is the second book in The Academy series and I just love this series!! This book can be read as a standalone but I love the fact that I had read the first book in this series, Disorderly Conduct, because it gave me much enjoyment to see how Charlie and Evers relationship has grown while reading this story. There is also the matter of Charlies older brothers secret desire for Danika that continues to burn throughout this story as well. I love all that, but that is not what Indecent Exposure is all about. This is the story of Jack Garrett finding the peace that he deserves.

Indecent Exposure was definitely the kind of love story that tugged at my heart strings! It was a story filled with lots of sexy times, dirty talking, and sweet romantic moments. It also deals with a difficult subject and there are darker moments in this romance but it is a humorous read, too. It kept my interest as I followed the story of these two characters who were both new to love with all its highs and lows. I am absolutely going to get my hands on the next book in this series because it deals with grumpy lieutenant Greer Burns, finally! I cant wait to get to know his character and see if he can mend things with Danika after being such a jerk in this book. Overall, Indecent Exposure is a swoon worthy addition to this series and I highly recommend it!

6311,1090,658,"1) The right words can bind someone more effectively than chains."" 2) ""Just because you don't understand or agree with something doesn't mean that it lacks merit.""

I think the synopsis is a tad misleading. I never thought of Devon as cold-hearted or rakish. He may have pretended to be in the beginning, but we can see that's not how he truly feels. The man is compassionate and puts the lives of others before his own. He didn't want the responsibility, but he handled it well and made improvements to benefit everyone, not just himself.

Despite past exploits, Devon claims he hasn't been that way for awhile, and that those activities have lost their appeal to him. He was mostly bored with the life he had been living, and I think he (subconsciously) saw this as a new and exciting challenge. He vocalized feelings that came across as insensitive, but his actions almost always contradicted his unkind words.

The other characters were very well-written, and I especially liked reading about the twins. I think the other sister, Helen, will be the focus of the next book, but I would really like to learn more about the twins and what their future entails. West (Devon's brother) was definitely a scoundrel in the beginning (but also not very cold-hearted) and was actually quite funny. He really fell in love with the people in the community and tried to better their lives however he could. He wasn't a guy in a suit afraid to get his hands dirty, but the one that rolls up his sleeves and offers assistance. Everyone in this book was a joy to read about, and really showed how working together in a community can be beneficial for everyone.

Kathleen is a strong female character that doesn't clutch her pearls when a handsome man is around. She is able to stand toe-to-toe with Devon even when he's being impossible. I'm positive she influenced some of his decisions and forced him to view the world differently. There are some shocking revelations about her, and I'm glad she was able to find her own happiness. No matter what her circumstances were, her heart always bled for others.

Cold-hearted Rake was an enjoyable read. The writing is absolutely beautiful, and a lot of the phrases have stuck with me. I had to buy this book to justify my ridiculous amount of sticky notes and tiny stars to mark my favorite places. I've heard amazing things about Lisa Kleypas, and this was my first book by her. I plan to read more of her books in the future, so if you have any recommendations, let me know!

Side note: I don't know how people, especially children, survived mourning periods back then. It seems miserable and unhealthy. I doubt the deceased cared whether their loved ones had black over their windows, wore veils, or secluded themselves from the world. I would want my family to go on living and enjoying life, because death only shows us how short that life actually is. I can't imagine trying to keep my three children indoors for a year because their father died, and it would be ""inappropriate"" for them to play and enjoy themselves. Oh, and men had significantly shorter mourning periods.

6312,474,1804,"Not disappointed. Not even a little bit. I love when Beverly Jenkins open the doors to a new venture back in time. This time we are served a sensual journey to love in the wilds of Wyoming. We have a beautiful little girl in need of love from a woman that understands her. We have a girl that has grown to a woman before our eyes (through the series) and wants love. What she finds does not do it for her? Regan is strong and determined to make her own happily love ever after. Then we have a man that just wants a mother for his daughter and vows to never love again. The story builds slow and grows with warmth, friendship, love, passion, connection, family.

Regan was strong in mind, body, and spirit. She was determined to be herself and do what she knew would make her happy. She was not the traditional heroine. She wanted love. She was not the traditional little demure woman of the west. She was in her own right wealthy. She would spend her money her way. She was just more.

Colton had me wanting to just let lose a can of whoop azz on him. He was stuck up, uptight, snooty, dare I say pr! ck. I wanted to love him right away, but as the story was a slow build. I began to love him slowly. Regan was the key to opening him up. She did wonders for him and his daughter.

Ive waited a long time to watch all the women from this series to grow up and get their own HEA. Now that I have it for each of them Im ready for the next historical romance series that BJ wants to send out into the world.

**Side note: I did find there were a few small issues with keeping up with who was saying what in several places. I found that I was needing to adjust to somethings in one place only to be in a completely different place and or time. There is drama, passion, compassion, angst, rivalry, and jealousy. I very much enjoyed this read. I have enjoyed each of the three books of this series.",1517270400,5
6313,111,1803,"Lady Aslyn Hastings, the ward of the duke of Hedley, has been cosseted all her life. It was always assumed that she would marry Hedleys son, the earl of Kipwick  Kip  who has always been like a brother to her. Aslyn is the picture of propriety, even though she longs for freedom. Mick Trewlove is Hedleys illegitimate son; Mick has crawled his way from poverty and became a wealthy and successful businessman, but with a chip on his shoulder the size of a small country. Mick wants the duke of Hedley to acknowledge him publicly so he can take the place he deserves in Society, and Mick will make Hedley bend to his will by taking destroying Kip and ruining Aslyn.

First of all, had it been mentioned that Mick did not intend to woo Aslyn, as is mentioned in the blurb, but ruin her, I would not have chosen to read the book. I dislike this sort of trope, although some authors have managed it successfully. Very seldom do I dislike both protagonists in a romance, and Im afraid it was the case with BEYOND SCANDAL AND DESIRE. The main problem was that the characters lacked depth, except for Fancy  Micks sister  and to some extent Kip. Another huge problem was Micks total lack of consistency: he abhors what is done to bastards, he will do anything to protect his sisters from being ruined, yet he is intent on ruining Aslyn, who is entirely innocent of the whole thing, thus making himself into precisely the kind of man he despises; it made no sense. As was pointed out to him during the story, why not ruin his father instead of innocents? Because. I thought Aslyn was a pathetic, spineless ninny, part of it was due to her upbringing, although she did grow some semblance of backbone at some point. I was ever so grateful to have been TOLD that she had some wanton thoughts early on, which explained her attraction to Mick. Aslyn had had no contact with men, apart from her male relatives and Kip, and from what I read, it was the only reason she could be attracted to Mick. As to Mick, I felt possessed no charm whatsoever, in spite of being endlessly reminded how wonderful he was. I found him boastful about his money and his achievements, snobbish, and forever spouting that he was a bastard, and that bastards were mistreated, with which I entirely agree. I had gotten the idea the first hundred times or so that allusions were made about illegitimate children. Mick is jealous of anyone who dares look at Aslyn; he will be the one to ruin her. How noble. I never felt for one moment that this romance would have happened had it not been strongly governed by external forces; nothing ever felt organic. I might have started warming up to our couple ever so slightly had Mick still not been bent on ruining Aslyn eventually after some intimacy had occurred between them, even after I was TOLD that he was having feelings for her. Mick is always so careful of her pristine reputation, because when Aslyn will be ruined, it will be on his own terms, thank you very much. How quaint. And even while being TOLD that Mick was a gentleman, he certainly wasnt.

The bright spot was Fancy: she felt like a ray of sunshine on a cold, dreary day, and even though she was not described at all physically beyond being seventeen years old, she was alive; she was the only character, besides Kip, who wasn't two-dimensional. Everything in BEYOND SCANDAL AND DESIRE felt so predictable, with opportune and unlikely about-faces, inexplicable character development that occurred somewhat spontaneously, and some of the most preposterous plot twists I have ever seen conclude this novel. The vibrant descriptions were a welcome respite from the lacklustre characters, the pace was steady throughout, and the writing was flawless. A review is ones objective thoughts on a book, we are all entitled to our opinions, and I know that mine will most likely ruffle many feathers, and that I will be in the minority. So be it, and I apologise if I antagonise anyone.

I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",1517270400,2
6314,128,1803,"""Is there not some part of you, some deep dark part of you, that longs for scandal?""

FINAL DECISION: A bit slow in developing, the romance between Mick and Aslyn builds up to a wonderful finish especially as the two spend quiet time together getting to know one another. In setting up the premise of the series and introducing all the characters, some of the emphasis on the couple is lost for the first third of the book, but the ending was unexpected and made me interested in the next in the series.

THE STORY: Mick Trewlove is the illegitimate son of a duke and a self-made businessman. Determined to get revenge for his father abandoning him to a baby farmer (where he might have ended up dead), Mick intends on ruining the Duke's legitimate son and seduce the son's betrothed. Lady Aslyn Hastings has been raised in all comfort and in expectation of marrying the Duke's heir. But now that her betrothal is at hand, Aslyn feels something missing and is tempted to the scandalous Mick.

OPINION: For me, the highlight of this book are the clandestine meetings between Mick and Aslyn which show growth and companionship and a true relationship. There is great beauty in how these two people find something special together.

Aslyn is a sheltered woman whose future has been planned out since childhood. It was always expected that she would marry her guardians' son and eventually become a duchess. As this book begins, Aslyn begins to find out that having one's future planned out means that she has missed so much of her interactions with others (especially men). Because she has never been courted or even flirted with other men because of the expectation in everyone's minds that she is settled.

When she meets Mick, she is tempted towards the scandalous, but rather than relying on the typical scandal plot line, this book instead focuses on the wrongness of the social rules that brand an illegitimate child with the sins of his parents. This book is deeply interested in the rules and the fates of those illegitimate children and the injustice of the social ostracism.

Mick is up to no good as this book begins, but finds himself challenged by his meeting with Aslyn. As the book begins, he is also trapped by the rules about illegitimacy. He seems to believe that all will be well if he can cause his father to acknowledge him (because being an acknowledged bastard is better). In many ways, his relationship with Aslyn turns his own notions around as well. He is a self-made man who cares about others despite his own perception of himself.

I loved the relationship between Mick and Aslyn as he shows her respect and treats her as a person -- not just a beautiful woman. The times that they spent together were gentle and moving. I found their discussions to be a wonderful and quiet way of developing their relationship.

I also really liked the twist in this book which was unexpected and interesting (reading the author's note at the end gave a insight as well).

The only problem I had with this book was the first third which was slow as it introduced quite a number of characters (which will be the subject of future books). The setup slowed the book down for me, but once the story truly began, I was caught up in the developing relationship between Mick and Aslyn.

WORTH MENTIONING: I love the potential stories of Mick's siblings.

CONNECTED BOOKS: BEYOND SCANDAL AND DESIRE is the first book in the Sins for All Seasons Series about six illegitimate children raised as siblings. I have hopes that the series will include stories for each sibling.

STAR RATING: I give this book 4 stars.

They may joke and squabble at each other, as well as use the foulest language, but they are also very honorable men and they will always do what is right. Love these characters! Edith was also a memorable character and the romance that develops between her and Niels was very swoon worthy. There is mystery, danger, seduction, and action in Surrender to the Highlander and it is also a book I highly recommend!

I had no problem at all just falling head first in to this read. I loved Edith also. I remember her from an earlier reads but vaguely.

Niels owes much to his beloved sister. If it was not for her, he and his brothers would not have gone to check on her friend and then they would not have found the misdeeds they did. But keeping watch over Edith was just so Niels. He was a very natural protector, as were all his brothers.

There was some mischief going on around this keep and it had nothing to do with the men that come over to pay a visit. I found this one to sing with mystery, suspense, passion, drama, Niels, his brothers and just plain romance. I love this series and want so much more.",1517270400,5

When you learn those stories, you learn experiences that fill you up, that expand your understanding. You add layers to your soul.

After the first few minutes, I thought this book was going to be as empty as Gia's head. Her personality left a lot to be desired, and she was so vain. Again, this is a story that could have been avoided entirely if people just told the truth.

I liked that the main conflict was with Gia and her friends. Boys played a role, obviously, but it was minor compared to her friend and family issues. I enjoyed seeing how those played out, and I commend Gia on her patience. She didn't like conflict, and she showed a lot of restraint when people were clearly using her or lying to make her look bad.

The ending was not wrapped neatly and tied with a bow. There were loose ends and things left unsaid, uncertain and unknown. I will say that Gia made progress with her personality. She didn't seem as shallow, and appeared to really be making an effort.

I didn't love or hate this book. It was a fluffy, light read that didn't require a lot of thinking or feeling on my part.

4 Gothic stars.

Moonlight Sins reminded me of Gothic romance. Old-school V.C. Andrews, where the reader is left wondering if there is something paranormal in the air. An old, gigantic mansion, a twisted, rich family who believes they are cursed, mysterious deaths, and questioned lineages.

I refuse to give a synopsis style review, as this truly is meant to be a mystery, and I refuse to post any spoilers, and the blurb gives a good rundown of the novel's setup. I went into the novel blindly, and I'm glad I did.

The book and the series has a great hook- a mystery that isn't revealed until the climax. Even with its slow-pacing, barely a trickle of information regarding the 'mystery' during the bulk of the novel, I was still intrigued enough to keep flipping the pages.

While it's a long book, with a dark, Gothic feel due to the setting and its mysterious characters, I will admit, the pacing and slow reveal does make it feel even longer than its page-count. If you're patient, the payoff is worth it. If you're more of an instant gratification reader, more interested in steam and angst than mystery, this novel may not be for you.

While I enjoyed Julia, and was curious about all of the de Vincent brothers, the romantic and sexual connection didn't pull me in as much as the mystery did. The romance felt forced, to me anyway. While there was plenty of banter between Julia and Lucian, as well as with Gabe, I didn't feel the spark. I never became emotionally invested in the characters.

I will say, near the ending, I was worried these two characters were going to be kept apart for the sake of another installment with them as the narrators. Not a spoiler, but a guarantee for those who need it- HEA was achieved.

While I figured out the mystery early on, and was only waiting to be proven right or wrong, the level of intrigue in the de Vincent family kept me actively engaged. I look forward to reading novels by Dev and Gabe in the future (I hope), and am curious to see where the author takes these characters and the series next.",1517270400,4

""Legend goes that only two things can happen to women of the de Vincent family or women who come here. They either end up.... unstable or they end up dead.""

Moonlight Sins is the beginning of a new contemporary romance series by Jennifer Armentrout and this book was a promising start! Julia is a live in nurse who gets hired by a wealthy client to care for a family member. But when she gets to her new job in Louisiana she doesn't realize it's one of the wealthiest families in the country.

The person she's to care for is to remain a secret, and the house she's staying in has eerie flickering lights and the sounds of footsteps. Julia also finds herself attracted to one of the de Vincent men Lucian, a notorious playboy. And he seems to have taken a liking to her too...

""You know what we are. What we always end up doing to people. We destroy them and then go about our lives like nothing  happened.""

I really enjoyed this story, Jennifer Armentrout is great at writing mystery and heroes to swoon over. This first book in a series holds so much potential and I cannot wait to see how the rest of the series goes.

The romance was really sweet, but surprisingly I found myself more interested in the mystery plot of the book more than the romance. I was hooked and wanted all my questions answered, so I sped through this book!

Fans of mystery romance genre, you will love this book!

6323,557,1802,"This was a spectacular read with twists and turns around every corner that had me holding my breath. It was an exciting web full of secrets and passion! The attention to detail was phenomenal. I thought Moonlight Sins was extraordinary!

The main characters Lucian and Julia were amazing. Right from the start they had this passionate chemistry, the kind that gets under your skin. There was tension and animosity as well as playfulness and fun. I loved Julia's strength and determination, uprooting her life to make positive changes. She was so sweet and caring. Lucian was awesome. He was charming and sexy and arrogant. A part of me wanted to dislike him but somehow he was so endearing and likeable, I fell in love with him.

The de Vincent family was fascinating, I loved learning their history. It's rich and detailed and I honestly felt like I was hanging on every word. I loved the dynamic of the brothers, they had such distinct personalities and I couldn't get enough. Every chapter felt like a revelation with everything I learned and yet it made me have a million more question. The author has done an incredible job laying a foundation for this series and I cannot wait for the next book.

The precision of the storytelling was spot on. It was a full story full of depth and layers. There were so many I didn't see that coming moments. The build to Julia and Lucian's relationship and to the suspense element were perfect. The mystery happening had me hooked! I was just so blow when I finished the story. I feel like I held my breath through the majority of the story because I was so mesmerized by the intensity, passion, and gripping details. I truly was riveted!

I could go on and on but Id be repeating myself. Its something you have to experience for yourself. I HIGHLY recommend this!

4 stars
M/F Romance, Mystery
Triggers: Suicide, Murder, Cheating, familial relationships
I was given this book for an honest review by Wicked Reads.

This is a slow burn romance novel. Julia and Lucian have a chemistry that is hard to describe. While I hated how they started, the instant heat between them was hard to deny.

Julia is relocating for a new job - she's nervous but knows that her life needs a change. After getting out of a less than stellar marriage, she feels that she can live her life for herself again. While out with her friend for her going away party, she meets a very handsome man and throws caution to the wind... whoops doesn't even begin to cover that when she meets her one night stand again.

Lucian is essentially written as a man whore from the beginning. He's the black sheep of the family and is not only proud, but holds his head high when his brothers point it out. What you soon discover is that Lucian is way more sensitive than who he projects. His family has MAJOR issues and watching him interact with his brothers is a test in patience and love. Really, his brothers are nutcases and Lucian seems the most stable.

When Lucian's sister returns after being gone for a decade unable to communicate, it becomes a mystery to be solved on where she's been. Loyalties will be tested and only Lucian and Julia can find their own way through their relationship. Will the secrets become too much?

This was a very intriguing story with a little creep factor and a lot of twists and turns. I can't wait to see what happens next because I hope those brothers of his get their own stories.",1517270400,4
6325,236,1802,"Moonlight Sins by Jennifer L. Armentrout is the First Book in the series ""de Vincent"". This is the story of Lucian de Vincent and Julia Hughes.

With no real social life and just her work friends as friends. So she takes the bold move to apply for a job out of the State and working has in home care for someone.
Lucian and his brothers are hard and tough guys who aren't emotionally attached to much. But Lucian is attached to their traumatized sister who needs in help care so when his older brother who first wanted to put her into a institution hires someone....Lucian goes to look into the new nurse named Julia Hughes's past.
This book has some mystery with the death of the de Vincent father. Lucian falls into instant lust with Julia although in the back of his mind her remembers that she said the de Vincent men fall instantly in love with the women they are to be with.

6326,955,1802,"Julia meets a sexy stranger during her going away party. Thinking she'll never see him again once she moves to New Orleans to take a private nursing job for a rich family, she agrees to take him up to her apartment for a one night stand, something the recent divorcee has never done before.

The night doesn't turn out exactly as Julia expected, as the guy leaves after giving her a very satisfying orgasm.

Turns out Julia's sexy stranger is essentially her boss, one of the brothers who hired her on to take care of a family member in their ginormous estate, an estate that may just be haunted.

Entering a dangerous world of family secrets, extreme wealth, and maybe even...ghosts!!, Julia needs to decide if Lucian is for real, or just out to use her.

This was...interesting. It felt like a cross between a V.C. Andrews novel (INCEST), a romance, and a mystery/suspense. I wanted a little more story, but everything felt a bit rushed, especially the ending. Armentrout was definitely setting up more story lines for future books.

I also didn't entirely enjoy or believe Julia's relationship with Lucian, as a I had a hard time believing she would be okay with his initial lie and the extreme power imbalance between them (employer/employee). She reminded me a bit too much of Anna Steele from 50 Shades of Grey. I appreciated the attempt to make her ""curvy,"" but found Lucian to basically be a sexy man-baby out to get what he wanted.

A fun start to a series, I'm interested to know more!

6327,474,1802,"What a way to start the series. JLA had a clear introduction to her new family with a gothic/contemporary romance/dark-edge flare. And the fact she chose New Orleans as the headquarters to such delicious tension, suspense, heat, secrets, drama, and romance was just the extra icing on top.  Meeting Lucien was a bit tense or intense. Have to mull that over some more to make a deeper and clearer decision. He was dominating in his personality. Reminding me a bit of another character from JLA (ya series). Julia was sweet, open, kind, and had a past hurt and a nagging problem. She was more than she appeared but a bit less than I was expecting. I enjoyed her and Lucien both apart and together. Their banter, passion, chemistry, connection was just something that stayed with me even a week after reading the book. I enjoyed the intensity, the drama, the secrecy, the passion, the chemistry, the secondary characters, the plot and possible subplot behind it all. I was drawn in to the world that was owned by the de Vincent's.

I went through a range of emotions on this one. Most were keeping me on edge whether good/bad/intense/indifferent. This was a read packed with much to make sure I come back for the next book of this series. I don't want to miss anything.",1517270400,4
6328,551,1802,"When I read the blurb for Moonlight Sins I was immediately intrigued. It sounded like a book that I would enjoy so I jumped at the chance to read it. Unfortunately it wasn't as intriguing as I thought and ended up not being one of my favorites.

Honestly I was just kind of bored with the story. It started out really well and I was all ready to get involved with these brothers. There was the mystery that I had been expecting and a little creepiness thrown in. But from there it all seemed to just die down. No solving of the mystery, no more thrilling moments, just no more anything really. Everything started dragging for me because other than Lucian and Julia circling each other, there wasn't much going on.

Then the ending came and it felt very rushed. There were no hints of answers throughout the story and then suddenly at the very end all the answers were thrown out into the open, yet by then I didn't really care about them.

This story had some good parts for me, mostly in the beginning, and the brothers did have some moments that made me want to know more about them. It wasn't a total bust and overall I can say I did like the story, just had a few issues with the pace.",1517270400,3
6329,128,1805,"""A woman who was shy and plain, who stammered when she was nervous and had never caught a man's eye in her life, could hardly be splendid at advising people about love and romance.""

FINAL DECISION: A wonderful emotional story about two people who have a mature and adult relationship thankfully free of misunderstanding and drama. The slow burn of this relationship made me so happy.

THE STORY: During the absence of her recently married sister, Clara Deverill has taken the reins of her family newspaper and the Dear Lady Truelove advice column. The problem is that Clara doesn't know what advice to give to people having problems with love -- until she overhears a conversation between two men which convinces Clara to write a column directed toward the poor woman they are discussing. When Rex Galbraith finds out about the column (which is obviously about the conversation with his friend) he comes in search of Lady Truelove. Clara and Rex soon reach an unexpected agreement involving the Lady Truelove column and an orchestrated ""courting"" between them in order to satisfy Rex's family.

OPINION: I loved this book because it was focused almost entirely on the couple and their developing relationship to the exclusion of everything else. No dramatic external storyline, no external barriers to their relationship. This is purely a story of two people developing a love for one another despite their initial belief that they could never be compatible.

Clara first sees Rex when he is giving advice to his friend (which involves lying to her about his intentions) and Clara sees that Rex is a rake who cannot be trusted. Clara has always wanted what is a traditional role -- marriage and children, but her sister's absence has placed her in charge of the newspaper and she begins to find her footing and the self-satisfaction of having a job. While Clara wants to marry, she is determined that she will marry for nothing less than love.

Rex is a man who has seen nothing but bad things come from ""love"". He is determined never to marry, but he finds himself enthralled by an innocent and respectable Clara even as he knows that he must keep his distance from her. Although Rex has been a rake, he is an honorable man at heart. (And I think somewhat of a romantic despite his cynical musings about love and marriage).

I absolutely loved the slow burn of this book. The gentle way that these two draw together and eventually find a happy ending. The story of the shy wallflower who tames the rake is often done in romance, but this book is different. The wallflower finds her own footing and refuses to settle for less than what she wants. She is willing not only to sacrifice but also to forge ahead with her own altered plans.

My favorite books are emotional and focused on the couple. This story is about the growth and change in these characters on their journey and I enjoyed every step.

WORTH MENTIONING: I like this historical era (Victorian) where class distinctions are blurring and womens' roles are expanding.

CONNECTED BOOKS: THE TROUBLE WITH TRUE LOVE is the second book in the Dear Lady Truelove series. It is not necessary to read the first book in the series although there are some overlapping characters.

STAR RATING: I give this book 4.5 stars.

6330,590,1181,"Snapshot is the first story and its narrated by Will Wheaton who does a most excellent job.

Set in the 80s, Strange Weather is the story of a 13 year old boy and his run in with a man he calls The Phoenician. The Phoenician is the villain of the tale. Hes ugly, vaguely imposing and possesses a camera that steals memories.

Its also a story about aging, and about caring for those who once cared for you. It has some misty eyed moments and just a wee bit of eeriness. It lags pretty badly towards the end though and left me feeling gloomy.

Loaded is narrated by Stephen Lang who is deadly serious for a deadly serious story.

This dark tale is about guns, hate, prejudice, revenge and the media. Im going to admit that there are many days that I have to turn off the news because I cant take in any more of the unending ugliness occurring in the US right now (as I write this there has just been another senseless school shooting that is barely getting any media coverage). This is a story I never would have chosen to spend my free time reading had I known more before going in. I read to escape this true life horror. This story introduces a group of mostly loathsome people who come together in a climax of bloodshed at a shopping mall, taking out a few innocents along the way. In the aftermath, it turns into a story of the stupidity of hero worship and the suspicious reporter who smells something fishy. Though well written, it wasn't my favorite and I would never read it again.

Aloft is narrated by Dennis Boutsikaris and just like the previous two narrators, he nails it.

Things go awry for a young man with an extreme fear of heights when he attempts to skydive to fulfill a wish made to a deceased friend and he ends up stranded on a cloud. This story is super imaginative but it also wasn't my favorite. Something about Aubrey just grated on my last nerve. I don't know if it was his fearfulness and gaseous emissions in the beginning, his never-ending pining away for a girl who was so not into him or just his personality. At any rate, it was a struggle and it shouldnt have been. I found his thoughts boring and all we get are his thoughts. Sorry, Im a jerk. I know this. If you're going to throw anything my way, make sure its a horror book.

Rain is the final story and, if you ask me, the best in the collection. It is read by Kate Mulgrew who is one of my most favorite of all the narrators in all of the lands.

So many people seem to loath this story and find it ridiculous (and yeah maybe it is that) but I thought it was heartbreaking and sarcastically funny and Honeysuckle was a character I loved spending time with (unlike that Aubrey fellow) which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. Shes tough and resilient as a spiky rain falls from the sky and reigns terrors on those caught up in it.

I have to say, with the exception of Rain, I found this collection a wee bit unsatisfying.",1517270400,3
6331,972,1802,"Don't I always say it? I love me a good book/series about brothers, or siblings in general. It's always fun watching them fall in love and seeing all their stories intertwine, and this series is no different. JLA brings the same flair and style to this book as she does with all her books, so if you like that, then you'll enjoy this. She kind of straddles the line of Paranormal with this book, and I often wondered if it was going to turn into that, but the book is Adult Romance at its core.

I will say that the mystery was pretty obvious, so if you're clever like that and can easily figure these things out, just keep that in mind. It's not hard. That usually doesn't deter me from a book, but one of these days I want to be truly stumped. In any case, it takes quite awhile for things to be revealed, as it is with most books, so also keep that in mind. Most of the book is focused on the growing attraction between Lucian and Julia and development of their relationship. The only thing that bothered me about their relationship was the whole ""Ms. Hughes"" thing. While I thought it was funny and cute at first, after while, it was just overkill. Besides that minor issue, I liked watching their story progress.

I am definitely curious to learn more about the other brothers and their family dynamic. That's probably the most intriguing and captivating thing about this series. There's just something about them and who they deal with that makes me wonder and keeps me coming back for more.

Im a fan of JLA, so I rarely even read the synopsis of one of her books, Im just here for it.

I loved Julia and Lucien. Shes skeptical and sweet. Hes arrogant and loyal. Their flirty banter and button pushing was seriously the best part of the book. And theres enough UST to power a small town. I really liked Gabe and Im eager to get my hands on his book, but Im not 100% sold on Dev.

Plot wise is where I struggled. I spent a good 1/3 of the book wondering if the family secret was them being vampires. There weren't any answers until about 85% and I didn't find them very satisfying. I was expecting a lot more with all of the talk of curses and various hush hush slash weird happenings.

Overall, it was the characters that had me intrigued enough to keep reading and Ill definitely read Gabes story.

There were about two minutes where I was actually listening to your conversation with her. There are times Lucian has no self control, eff it, he growled. And then he kissed her.""

6334,1090,1633,"I meant it when I said I didn't believe in love at first sight. It takes time to really, truly fall for someone. Yet I believe in a moment. A moment when you glimpse the truth within someone, and they glimpse the truth within you. In that moment, you don't belong to yourself any longer, not completely. Part of you belongs to him; part of him belongs to you. After that, you cant take it back, no matter how much you want to, no matter how hard you try.

First, I want to start by saying I didn't know Claudia Gray was a pseudonym. I happened to see that little fact on her Goodreads profile. Am I the only one that didn't know this??

Now, to the book! Well, audiobook. I've learned that during this stage of my life, audiobooks work best for me. There are no paper pages for little fingers to grab. My husband lost a beloved book this way (and why I keep all of mine on the higher shelves). The twins will be one this month, and they are in EVERYTHING.

I was intrigued by the synopsis for this book, so I downloaded the audiobook from my library. It was the first I had heard of it, so I didn't really know what to think when it started. Gray throws us into the story from the first page. Marguerite is in a body that is both hers and not hers, and doing things that make absolutely no sense. It was great! I loved getting knee-deep into the story before getting more background. My interest was piqued, and I was hooked. I needed to know more!

I did hate how easy it was for Marguerite to blindly want to destroy someone with very little evidence, and only half of the facts. I get that she was emotional and hurt, but if you're going after someone with the intention of killing them (or stranding them in another dimension), you had better be a million percent sure you are correct. There's no room for doubt when someone's life hangs in the balance. You also shouldn't try to kill someone else, but what do I know.

I was slightly annoyed by the love triangle, but I've never really been a fan. I don't like it when the main character's heart is torn in two different directions. Someone always, always gets hurt.

Everything considered, this was a captivating and unique story. The science aspects weren't confusing, but still complex enough to explain travel to other dimensions. I never felt lost, or that concepts were over my head. Marguerite also never jumped somewhere boring. Her blended background allowed for numerous possibilities, and we get to experience a few of them.

A Thousand Pieces of You makes you think about decisions, and whether each one potentially changes the outcome of your future. Is everything fated, or do the small choices we make have a bigger impact than we know?

6335,731,1802,"JLA does it once again with Moonlight Sins! This is a very promising start to a new series and I am loving the feel of this series. It has such a gothic and slighty creepy feel at times but it is also so hot and sexy and of course has some snark thrown in.

I loved Julia. I think what makes her shine most is her compassion. She clearly cares for her patients and the people around her and I think that is such an admirable character trait. She is thrown into a crazy and intense situation and she handles it well. And of course Lucian is basically walking and talking swoon. I absolutely adored him and his sense of humor. The banter between Lucian and Julia was so so great and their chemistry was off the charts.

And of course the other de Vincent brothers intrigued me to no end! Gabe seems like he can be quite the charmer and Dev... well there is a lot more I wanna know when it comes to Dev. This family is steeped in secrets and I cannot wait to peel back more of them in future books.

Moonlight Sins is another great read from JLA. Her books never fail to captivate me with great characters and a great story and I know I am going to love this newest series from her.",1517270400,4
6336,939,16,"I know that it is still January, but this is my favorite book of the year. Yes, I am cementing it's spot right now.

Angie Thomas is an amazing writer. Her characters are perhaps the best I have ever read. They are real three-dimensional human beings that are living right in front of you. They bring you into their worlds, letting you know their emotions and motivations without ever being over the top. Each character is distinct and complex.

Her writing is also amazing. The sentence structure, word choices, and descriptions make the world so vivid that it still seems real to me. Starr, the main character, lives between two worlds and these world show beautifully in the way that Thomas writes. I can not wait to read her next book, she is truly an amazing writer.

Then there is the topic of the book. Talking about the dynamics between police and the black community is a complex topic, especially since it involves the death of so many young men and women. I cannot imagine a better way to tell the story then Thomas does. Starr is caught between her world of being black and going to a white school. By including Starr in both worlds it bridges the gap between the cultures and allows to reader to not only identify with their culture but to emphases with the other. Then you have her uncle who is a police officer, allowing his voice to be heard. You have the Asian best friend that tends to represent all non-black minorities. I think an entire thesis could be written on the dynamics of how she chose to represent this issue in her book.

I am amazed by this book. I think that everyone should read it. I plan to get a hardcover copy so that my children will read it. Not only is it amazing literature it is a message that needs to be heard, and Thomas lends her amazing voice so that it can be understood.",1517270400,5
6337,396,1800,"Indecent Exposure was such an amazing contemporary romance. No surprise, given that Tessa Bailey is the author, but even by Tessa standards this book was extra amazing! It was pretty much a flawless contemporary romance in my opinion. First off, the heroine was absolutely wonderful. I really loved Katie. She was such a quirky and likable heroine. And of course I loved Jack, but then I already liked his character from the previous book, so it wasn't surprising that I absolutely fell in love with him in this book. Although, when it came to Jack I was kind of surprised with how intense and serious his backstory was and all the issues he was dealing with as a result of his past. But, I really liked the way that the author dealt with Jack's issues in this book and the ways in which she had the heroine help him without having Katie completely try to change him and make him someone else. And talking about Jack and Katie together, their relationship was so adorable in every way. From the way that they met while she was on her strange mob hit location tour until the end when they admitted they were in love with each other there love story was EVERYTHING. Seriously, these two were so cute together. I always say that Daniel and Story from Tessa's Line of Duty series are my favorite of her couples, but Jack and Katie were so close to replacing them as my faves. Overall, this book was a flawless contemporary romance. I couldn't get enough of this story and these characters and I highly recommend it!",1517270400,5
6338,474,1800,"What can I say sexy man, sexy Irish accent, beautiful blue eyes . . . oh most of this belongs to her. This was one read that took me a bit by surprise. I have not read book one of this series yet, but I am making an appointment to do so. This was a fun read. I laugh a lot. I had lots of fun getting to know both Jack and Katie. I really liked Katie a lot. Jack was so-so for me. He could have been so much more but there was just something holding me back from truly enjoying him as a character. I found that Jack and Katie did not match each other. She was more open, honest, fun loving, straightforward, sexy, sassy, and had that great accent. She was the best.

I found the writing smooth flowing, complementary to the characters being written, the secondary characters are rich and present. I found a connection with the pain of Jacks past but he was just a man that needed to have sometime to himself. He focused a bit too much on other things when he needed a lot of work himself.

I will revisit this read again after I read book one. Just mainly to see if my prospective changes any. Sometimes that happens when I step in to the midst of an already in progress series.",1517270400,4

6340,474,1803,"I can't say that I was in love but I did like this read. It was the classic way of historical romance. One bastard. One orphan. One for vengeance. One for freedom. Mick tick off a lot of turn off boxes for me right away. He eventually began to gain some points but something would have them taken again. He was not the classic hero of the historical romance. He was petty, vengeful, spiteful, hypocritical, and not well rounded. Aslyn took too long to gain a backbone. She knew she only thought of Kip as a brother. She knew she wanted more than the planned life for her. She knew so many things but lacked that spark, in the beginning. I guess to put it flat out. The things that irritated me most bout both Aslyn and Mick gave me a path to appreciating the things they did have. I did not find that they were developed on a deeper level but the depth there was enough to provide a tale that had its moments of give and take.

There were a few secondary characters that I enjoyed a great deal. I hope to see more of them in the future reads of this series. To have put this read at the top would have needed a deeper connection with both Aslyn and Mick. I wanted to know them on a deeper level. I wanted to get past the anger and resentment of Mick and see more of him. Aslyn I wanted her to be just more.",1517270400,3

I didn't love The Hating Game. Lucy and Joshua really frustrated me as characters, and I didn't understand their reasons for the games they played. If you hate a coworker with every fiber of your being, it makes more sense to remain professional and pretend they don't exist.

It was clear that their games were thinly veiled flirtations, but neither of them admitted their feelings, and the progression of their relationship was painful. It also didn't feel realistic to me. Lucy had the potential to be a quirky-cute character, but a lot of her actions and conversations were childish.

I didn't mind listening to this in the background, but I wasn't too worried if I missed something. I'm sorry if you recommended this to me! I know it's disappointing when a friend doesn't like a book as much as you did.

6343,271,1807,"This is a classic ""close knit family of siblings threatened by outside forces"" book, but crossed with a slightly fey magical realism style that can delight and grate in equal measure. You know, sometimes you can press a book into someone's hands and enthusiastically urge them to give it a try. And sometimes you close a book, sigh, and walk away. This book struck me as more plus than minus, but at lots of places it walks a very narrow line.

The setup is that we have seven siblings. Each was born on a different day, is named after the day, (Mona, Sundae), and has the attributes of the children from that old folk poem, (""Monday's child is fair of face...""). So far so good. The kids are living alone, (the eldest, Sundae, is 16), because their parents are off on some magical adventure/quest. Then their house blows up and they have to leave their cozy hidden homestead in the mystical woods and move into the shuttered house of their absent grandfather, which is an unwelcome eyesore in the middle of an uptight and unfriendly town. The siblings are threatened and stink-eyed by an evil neighbor and her gang of nasty pals, even though the kids are goodnatured and fun loving. Again, so far so good.

The thing is, though, that the clever and magical angle, at the start, is unrelenting. You don't have spiders, you have circus spiders. You don't have a squirrel watching the action, you have a robot squirrel. The Tuesday child doesn't speak, he just unleashes one of over 200 different farts, each of which has a different meaning. There's a pet pig. At some point this feels like a dessert made entirely of sugar and you start to get a little queasy.

Happily, once the kids move into grandpa's house they settle down and a plot, (a search for grandpa's secret), starts to form. Also, while the neighbor adults are all pills the neighbor kids, who are at least relatively normal, start to come around. This dilutes the antic excess of the Problim children and gives the plot, and the book, some direction.

The upshot for me was that this was interesting but sort of exhausting. It's the first book in a trilogy and everything is left hanging at the end so if you are a reader who requires closure be aware that you're signing up for a three book deal.

(Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book without a review requirement, or any influence regarding review content should I choose to post a review. Apart from that I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book.)",1517270400,3

Aha. ""I'm not handling your snake.

This entire review could easily just be quotes from the book. I had so many favorites! Like, If you're really hard up, I can introduce you to my grandmother. Shes a fan. Adam blinked. She doesnt typically sleep with pretty young things, but she would make an exception in your case. You might even learn a trick or two.""

There are many others, but I'll let you read the book and discover them for yourselves--definitely worth it! I always mark the pages that have meaningful moments, or quotes that I want to go back to, and this would have been filled with bookmarks and post-it notes if it hadn't been an audiobook.

I will say this about Nevada... the girl has way too much self-control. Seriously. If I was being (view spoiler) 

But that didn't happen. Nevada is sensible and likes to be in control. She's proud of what she has accomplished, and she wants to remain as independent as possible. I can respect that. I will also admit that she has actual, decent reasons for not immediately having sexy times, but I still wish she had acted on more of her impulses and desires.

While I may have wanted more romantic scenes, this book wasn't lacking in action or humor. I smiled and laughed the entire time. It could have been just a small quip from Nevada, or Rogan asking an intentionally devious question--I loved it all!

I've been promised less self-control in book two, so my fingers are crossed!

6348,555,1805,"Book two in The Dear Lady Truelove Series tells the story of a shy young lady who believes in love and happily ever afters.  Unfortunately, the man she has fallen in love with wants nothing to do with love and never plans to marry.

Clara Deverill is the sister of the heroine in the first book in this series and is left in charge of the newspaper that her sister saved and kept them from being destitute.  Now Irene is on her honeymoon and Clara is in charge of the newspaper.  She has never been the kind of girl to put herself forward and she let her sister take care of everything.  Now she realizes that it up to her to keep the business going until her sister returns.  She is having trouble with almost every part of the newspaper but mostly the advice column that her sister started called Dear Lady Truelove.  She has no idea how to give advice to woman and men about their life and love.  Then one day she is in a tea shop and hears a conversation that will change her life forever.

Rex, Viscount Galbraith is a man who has a reputation as a rake.  The rumors of his love affairs, drinking and spending money has landed him in a spot.  His father has cut off his allowance and refuses to relent until he finds a suitable young lady and marries her to ensure the succession.  Rex has no intention of listening to his father, being that his father and mother married for love and what a disaster that turned out to be.  When one of his good friends asks to meet to discuss a problem he is having with his mistress.  Rex's has no idea that his advice to his friend would be overheard and printed almost word for word in a gossip column.  When he goes to the office of the newspaper and finds a young lady he is dumbfounded.  What happens next will turn his life upside down and makes him doubt his long-held beliefs in love and marriage.

I loved this book, it is pure enjoyment from cover to cover.  Laura is an exceptionally talented writer who knows how to write a beautiful love story that has wit, wonderful characters that will stay with you long after you finish this book.  Clara's innocence and belief in love are contradictory to everything Rex has ever believed and wanted.  The way Clara slowing chips away at Rex's beliefs are both touching and witty.  From the first meeting, they have a connection that will surprise them both.

I have read all of Laura Lee's books and loved them all, but Clara will hold a special place in my heart because I was kind of naive and innocent when I first went out into the world and like Clara I found my true love and happily ever after.",1517270400,5
6349,474,1805,"I wanted to go all out and call this an amazing read, but the wallflower and the rake takes its toll on us all at some point. Especially when one happens to read a large number of historical romance throughout the year. But there happens to be something different here. Clara had a little more than just her wallflower existence to rely on. She was in fact and advice giver of sorts. She used the knowledge she learned as a wallflower to dispense advice secretly.

Rex on the other hand was indeed a rake but he was one rake that found himself seeing his words in column. Not just any column but one that dispenses advice. I am a read that reads a lot and I have read several of LLG's books. This would be my first in this series. I am much delight to find that I like it and look forward to going back and reading the first book of the series. I find that Clara was just so fun and Rex was more than just the advice he gave. He held my attention.

This historical romance has a sweet heat that slowly burns. I loved the secondary characters and past characters from the previous book. Irene seems to be more my speed in heroines. I find there was something intriguing about Clara also but in a different way. I was not slayed by the circumstance of this romance but I was held in place by the whole package.",1517270400,4

This review is going to be for White Hot and Wildfire. I devoured these books (barely sleeping), and I'm not sure where one ended and the other began.

Words cannot express how much I love this series! It's seriously one of my all-time favorites. They are books that I will read again and again until I'm old and gray, and even then their audiobooks will be played at an insanely loud volume to compensate for my nearly nonexistent hearing.

I love the relationship Nevada and Conner have. He wants to protect her and keep her safe, but he isn't macho about it. He wants Nevada to be her own person and make choices without his influence. He knows that she is capable of defending herself (even if he wants to murder all of her enemies), so he doesn't try to keep her away from danger. He sees her as an equal, and I absolutely love that. They are repeatedly there for each other, and I adored the progression of their relationship. It was perfect.

The family dynamic in this series is incredible. I love the Baylor family and its many members. Grandma Frida is hysterical, and you know you'll laugh when she's around. There is a small age gap between some of the members, and I think Ilona does a wonderful job highlighting those differences. Teenagers are angsty and emotional. They're also prone to rash decisions and heightened feelings. Nevada is always concerned about what is best for them, but really they are all devoted to each other. They fight like family, but their love for each other is always there.

The villains are even superbly written. I don't think I had an issue with any character (except morally), because they were all detailed and driven. There was a reason behind everything, even if we don't know what those reasons are.

The magical aspect is phenomenal. It's new and refreshing, but also detailed and descriptive. I'm not confused by how it works, and you can tell the author put a lot of work into the why and how of it all.

Bonus: I never knew what was going to happen! If the characters were surprised, so was I. I didn't know anything before they did, and I wasn't able to guess things before they happened.

Magic, steamy romance, action, family, monsters, pacifist bears--this series has it all and more! If you haven't read the first book, Burn for Me, stop reading this right now and go find it!

How a book can be this sexy, this heartbreaking and this wonderful is almost beyond my comprehension. I knew going in that Indecent Exposure was going to be goodit is Tessa Bailey, after all, and shes a favorite of mine for a reasonI just didn't know how much, how easily it would suck me in.

Or that it would grab my heart and squeeze.

Jack Garrett is, oof, I almost couldn't handle it. So beautifully broken, he reminds me in some ways of another favorite of mine from Ms. BaileyBelmont Clarkson. Theres damage within, which formed an ache that simmered and bubbled below the surface of every page, between every line. I hurt for Jack, this physically perfect, charming, devil-may-care man who had so much more going on down deep.

And as for Katie . . . well, shes just WOW. I loved her, how she grew from timid and disbelieving into someone with a quiet but unrelenting strength. How she always had thatshe didn't need to be fixed, just guided. Her lilting voice in my head made me smile, her convictions earned my respect and her kindness and truthing ability won me over completely.

Indecent Exposure, like Jack and like Katie, has much more going under the surface than you might first expect. Its shaded with grit and laced with humor. It has spiky tension and tender moments. It changes with each page and chapter but reads steady and true.

Essentially, its perfect. Hot and dirty in the way that Ms. Bailey seems to have on lock, but sweet and touching, too. Its wonderful, and Id say I cant believe it, but I can. I do. And you should, too.

Whenever I picture you, I think of the day we met. Youre walking away, telling me its going to take a long time to forget my eyes.

Saw past his drinking to see the real Jack that no one else saw, gave him a glimpse of a future he didn't know he wanted.

This book was so, so good. Jack...gah...Jack is one of the most broken heroes I think I've ever read. Reading his story is painful. Reading where he is at mentally is painful. Watching him go through this story is painful. But that's what makes this story so darn good. Because it's a romance novel and you know that redemption is coming. No one deserves to find his happy place more than Jack.

So, this story...Katie is in the states for two weeks, teaching a special arms class at the NYC police academy. This time frame is her chance...her chance to break out of her glass box for the first time in her life. As a gold medalist, she's done nothing but train for years. She's ready to break out of her shell...to truly live for the first time ever. And the first night in the states, she meets Jack and is enchanted and fascinated by this gorgeous, flirt of a man.

Jack is charming. He knows he's good in bed and figures that's his talent in life...to give women a good time in bed. The problem is...that's the ONLY thing Jack thinks he has to give in life. Jack has had an unusual upbringing that is absolutely heartbreaking and left deep, deep scars on his psyche.

But everything is different with Katie. He feels with Katie, and that both terrifies him and gives him hope, something to hold onto. But he's a student at the police academy. She's an instructor. She's only here for a couple of weeks. And Jack is hiding huge secrets. This is never going to work out and it's eventually all going to come crashing down.

I read this entire book with my heart in my throat. I wanted to sob for Jack. His pain on the page is palpable. I just wanted to wrap him up and take care of him. Katie has no idea what she's getting into, and even though she knows she shouldn't, she just keeps getting deeper and deeper.

I loved them both as individual characters, but the two of them as a couple were phenomenal. They're healing, empowering, passion, and HOPE. Gah, this book was SO GOOD! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!

I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review, but I also bought a print copy for my keeper shelf.",1517270400,5
6360,112,1800,"Indecent Exposure is book 2 in The Academy series. I enjoyed book 1 so I knew I had to grab this novel. I'm glad I did, because we got to meet Jack Garrett in the previous novel but I really wanted to know more about him. I knew a bit about his past from book 1 but we learned a lot of his backstory and why he is the way he is in this installment.

So Jack Garrett is out and about when he spots Katie McCoy, a gorgeous woman that he can't take his eyes off of. Thing take an interesting turn when he learns she's playing tourist and her goal is to find places that had mob hits. I can't say I've heard that one before, she's quirky and not from the USA which I loved. Anyway, they wind up sharing a kiss and making plans and when Jack goes to training (he's training to be a police officer) in walks Katie much to both of their surprise. You see, Katie is actually an Olympic gold medalist and expert markswoman and on the police training program she's there to instruct them in firearms. They know things shouldn't happen since they're now in a teacher/student situation but neither can deny the electricity. They try to keep business and pleasure separate but it wouldn't be a love novel without someone breaking the rules.

Indecent Exposure makes me want the next book asap. I can't wait to see what will happen next especially with it being Danika's book. I was intrigued when the novel added in addiction (alcohol) and I liked that Jack wanted to try to get clean. I got a slightly weird feeling it was only for Katie though. He for sure wouldn't have attempted it without her influence. Other than that though, I really enjoyed this novel. If you're a fan of steamy guys in uniform you'll enjoy this series.",1517270400,4
6361,808,69,"""A celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared.""

Although this classic novel doesn't rival Pride and Prejudice it is still entertaining in its own right. Once again, we have the class tensions simmering below the surface whilst maintaining a pretense of cordiality. The standout feature of this work is the judgment of an incisive critic upon the popular fiction of her day. Austen loathed unrealistic romantic stories with predictable headlines. She sought to prove to her peers that it was both possible and preferable to present ordinary characters going about their everyday business and to make the narrative entertaining. She has achieved her goal.

Catherine Moreland, a most normal heroine, joins some acquaintances for a stay in Bath. There she meets a number of characters and forms some strong attachments. Among them is the uncouth and irritating John Thorpe, but also the wealthy Tilney family. Hopes of a romantic sort are set in motion for Catherine when the General, father of Henry Tilney, starts to pay her excessive attention. Then Catherine receives an invitation to stay with the family at Northanger Abbey.

Austen's writing and language require serious engagement and are not light reading:

To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity, her actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement, is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character.

If you enjoy mental gymnastics as you figure out what exactly the author is trying to communicate or if you are of a generation when this language was slightly more common place, you will enjoy this. It's always good to use our brains and you will definitely need it for Jane Austen's writings.

I enjoyed Northanger Abbey more because I don't think I have seen a film adaptation so the story was new. I recommend reading the book prior to watching the film.

In conclusion, something for you to ponder...or make you scratch your head!

6364,808,212,"I reckon I got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally says she's going to adopt me and sivilise me, and I can't stand it. I been there before .

I thought I should start the year with another classic and what better book to choose than Huckleberry Finn which the author, ""Mark Twain"", had vowed to ""pigeon hole, or burn"", prior to its publication!

I located the audio which is in the public domain: Huckleberry Finn Chapter 1. I hadn't realised it was 43 CHAPTERS, though, and that listening to the audio would end up being a painfully slow way of getting through this book. Although the first few chapters were entertaining, I found myself drifting off and thinking about other things. Forcing myself to PAY ATTENTION TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT CLASSIC, I managed to make it to around chapter 20 before I gave up. The lazy voice of the narrator fits the book and its pace, but unfortunately there wasn't much hope of me getting anywhere near the end of this....as I was lulled to sleep by the monotony. (Note to self: this would be a good book to listen to on a long lone car journey when there aren't many distractions.)

I was curious about why this is a classic and as I only made it less than halfway through the book and can't say that I was paying that much attention when I was listening, I went searching for a simpler way of learning about it.

I was pleased to find this crash course: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Part 1: and The Raft, the River, and The Weird Ending of Huckleberry Finn: This explains everything you need to know in less than thirty minutes! The most interesting comment the guy makes, after saying that Huck sees the river as a god, is that we all worship something and if it hadn't been the river, it would've been something else. That's because God created us to worship Him if only more people would realise it!

For those that can't cope with that level of academia or the frantic pace of the speaker, try this alternative: Huck and Tom's Mississippi Adventure Full Movie . (I thought you'd appreciate this.)

I'm not going to summarise the plot as I'm sure most readers know it. It was amusing to note that most of the people commenting on the Youtube Crash Course were students desperately trying to complete essays on the book prior to deadlines. They were all very grateful for the summary. I'm not sure how many people would choose to read this book from cover to cover.

6366,315,67,"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thought crime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.

If he gets caught, he will be sent to the ""Ministry of Love"" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.

6367,1068,594,"Ok so, I really liked Borne and I decided to give this a shot since I saw its being made into a movie. First off, Vandermeer is the king of world building IMO and his writing can be perceived as drawn out and boring. He isn't one for dialogue, thats for sure but when he does write it, you know its meaningful.

That being said, I didn't enjoy this as much as I wanted to. I kept waiting for that big reveal, but it never truly came. It reminded me of playing a slow paced survival horrid game where theres no much music until you happen upon the corpse of your dead team member. Then theres that AH HA moment. The rest of it plays out as you find hidden clues about a place Im not even sure really exists or if its all in your head.

I see the movie just the same. Lots of cinematic landscapes with ominous music and close ups of the cast doing nothing but peering off and wondering why the Hell they signed up for this and internet people go, Youre not getting the deeper meaning, and Ill respond, clipping my toenails is a better use of my time.",1517270400,3
6368,394,1667,"Narrated by George Guidall, I nearly gave this book back to Audible. He was a very boring narrator. But I got used to him and near the end, he started using some expression in his voice. I had the Kindle version but wanted to be busy with my hands while listening. I didn't want to follow the text. So I stuck with it.

Two things against this book before I even got started so take this with that grain of salt. First, it doesn't fit with my goal of reading women authors/women main characters. Second, I'm not much on mysteries. Most mysteries are murders. You know, I think better mysteries are those we live with every day. 'Where'd I leave my keys or glasses?'

Since my friend gave me the CD of the next in the series I wanted to read the first book before diving in. I had ordered this from the library but Amazon told me I already had the book, so I canceled the loan.

The day in which this book takes place is actually one of his better days, despite the frigid cold, meager gruel, endless body searches, and back-breaking work.  Shukhov has figured out a few tricks to survival, including hiding tools and bread, but what hed really like is a sick day.  I thought at first that he must be a political prisoner, but actually he was released from a German WWII POW camp and then arrested in his homeland on suspicion of being a German spy.  If this misconception isn't ludicrous enough, consider the state of the prison camp.  Incomplete buildings and broken machinery abound.  One of the reasons that everything is in disrepair is because the work reports, in which productivity is always exaggerated, are apparently more important than the quality of the work.  The convicts break off a railing to use as firewood, thus giving us another glimpse as to why the camp is in disarray.  Shukhov periodically has to reassess the value of his dignity, as he considers how low he is willing to stoop to survive.  This dysfunctional prison camp is perhaps a microcosm of the USSR in many waysunable to feed itself with a workforce unmotivated to build an infrastructure.  This novel may be a standout as social commentary, but as literature, it underwhelmed me somewhat.",1517270400,3

6372,241,903,"In London, in 1907, Irishman Edward Malone is a journalist, and also has a certain reputation as an athlete. What he doesn't have, in the eyes of his beloved Gladys, is fame and a reputation for daring, romantic adventure. On these grounds, she utterly rejects him.

Malone is not yet ready to give up, though, and appeals to his editor for an assignment that will give him the scope for adventure and fame that Gladys wants the man she marries to have.

His editor sends him off to interview Professor Challenger, a naturalist who returned from South America with a wild tale no one believes, about impossible prehistoric beasts still alive there. Oh, and Challenger has assaulted those who disbelieve him too directly.

He survives his first meeting with Challenger, and at his invitation attends a public lecture being given by another naturalist, whom Challenger does not respect. Somehow, and really, don't skip this part; it's a lot of fun, Challenger, the famous big game hunter Lord John Roxton, another naturalist Challenger isn't on good terms with named Professor Summerlee, and Malone are soon off to South America with the official assignment of verifying Challenger's wild claims.

It's 1907. Every one of these characters, and their creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, is a man of the 19th century, and being good, decent, liberal-minded men of that era does not make them men of the first quarter of the 21st century. Be prepared for that. If you feel you're not going to be comfortable with rolling your eyes and remembering they're actually rather decent compared to the overall standard of their time, this might not be your book. If you can do it, though, this is a fun book.  Malone and his companions find a high, almost inaccessible mesa, with creatures long thought extinct, but also two uncontacted tribes.

I grew up in the mid-20th century. I learned to be polite to people who believed some of the nonsense these people believe, because they were my elders and, though my parents would never have been so disrespectful to their elders as to say so, they didn't know better.

That was losing ground as a useful excuse even then. I can't imagine today's Millennials have heard this excuse, and if they have, they surely haven't been taught to be polite about that nonsense.

This is a fun book, but I'm not sure it's a good thing that I can roll my eyes at the background racism and say that.

It's a fun book, but it's a period piece, and its worst flaws come directly from its period character. That makes it hard to recommend. Proceed with caution.

6375,808,501,"I was given a Book Lover's mug for Christmas with pictures and lists of classic books. Wanting to show that I appreciated the gift, I got started straight away. I have already read Lord of the Flies and Pride and Prejudice  at one end of the mug's list and I didn't fancy Jane Eyre at the other end, as I've just watched the film....so....

Heart of Darkness it was and boy do I wish I had gone with Jane Eyre. I couldn't make sense of this tale at all! The rambling musings of a man at sea boring his companions to tears with distant memories of a time that he went fresh water sailing. At least, I think that's what was going on!

There were some incredible scenes which were vividly drawn but because I couldn't keep the thread of the narrative, there was no context. Either that, or the story was just really, really slow! I gave up just over halfway through when I began looking for any excuse to relieve the mind numbing boredom....

Her professor husband (metaphysical philosophy) seems aloof to her and unemotional towards their children, yet it pangs him to admit to himself that he needs kind words and praise from her. The insightful hostess consciously withholds what he often cravesis it out of pique?
  Quietly knitting red-brown stockings for the son of distant lighthouse keeper, she mentally marks the pulse of life on the shore which faces the distant light house--the object of her youngest sons interest. Ah--but to Reach the light house one needs a forecast for no rain and steady winds. What will they ultimately find out there at pale tower on a small rock barely jutting out of the sea?

Very little action or plot development occurs in this 200-page novel, as readers are inundated with the thoughts of various characters--in a stream-of-consciousness style. Their private emotions are recorded clearly for us--while remaining inaudible to others.

The second part of the book, after much TIME PASSES, centers on Lily, a 43-year-old Chinese amateur artist. Whereas Mrs. Ramsay continuously knit while observing, Lily attempts to paint. But both women are fascinated by the lighthousealbeit for different reasons; Mrs. Ramsay seems mesmerized by the beacons glowslipping over the rippling waters, which gently invades every room, stair and curtain of the old house. In her turn Lily intently observes the progress of a small boat which contains three Ramsays, bent on reaching the tower at last.

  Family dynamics are revealed in painful detail, as adults and later the children analyze their versions of the truth. Hosts and guests entertain private thoughts about each other.

6380,808,1362,"Another Grisham legal thriller successfully concluded.

This is definitely one of the author's most exciting and unusual books. I think, in part, because those who have never served on a jury always wonder what exactly goes on behind those closed doors. They will never find out, though, because most countries have laws protecting the deliberations from being made public. So, we will never know whether an irresponsible jury just flipped a coin for the verdict, or whether they decided they didn't like the defendant's lawyer's hair colour and punished him for it.

In this book, all is revealed as we are taken behind the scenes and into the jury room in a ""does smoking cause lung cancer?"" case. The defendant, a large tobacco company is basically representing all tobacco companies who fear class action if the verdict goes against them. However, they don't need to worry as seasoned expert Fitch comes to the rescue with his pool of money and ability to operate outside the law.

The jury is selected in a rush of activity as the experts scramble to analyse every detail of their lives. There's just one unknown, who's managed to slip through the net. He seems harmless enough, but the inability to find out anything about him is making both sides slightly anxious. Just who is Nicholas Easter and what are his intentions? And why are the jury behaving so strangely?

This book keeps the reader guessing until the very last page. It has been masterfully created and intricately planned and executed. The characters are well developed and believable.

Grisham often includes themes of absolute power corrupting absolutely and the ability to buy oneself out of any and every situation. The interesting twist this time is the ethical aspect--does the end justify the means? Is it okay to commit a crime or to blackmail someone if your intentions are honourable? What if they are also corrupt--do two wrongs cancel each other out and make a right? Are the people then both as bad as each other? The Bible tells us that we should do what is right even if it means standing alone and even if everyone else is doing something different. The way that we do things is just as important as the outcome--we cannot expect to achieve a good outcome if we act deceitfully in the process. We are ultimately accountable to God not people for the way that we live and conduct ourselves.

Another bonus to this particular book is that the language is pretty clean, there are just a few border line curse words. There is no violence and there are just a few references to sexual activity that aren't graphic.

For those who aren't sure whether they will enjoy John Grisham, this is a good place to start. One of my favourites, recommended.",1517270400,4

6382,815,399,"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold is a bitter and angry novel about Cold War spies that refuses adamantly to glorify or glamorize their activities and that digs beneath the patriotic ideologies in the name of which secret agents act to uncover the morally troubling effects their plots have on real people.

It begins with a scene of maximum tension at the Berlin Wall. Alec Leamas, a British agent responsible for a network of spies in East Germany who are being rounded up, is waiting in a checkpoint in West Berlin, hoping that the last of his agents will be able to escape. After that agent gets shot down before his eyes just before crossing the border, Leamas retreats to London in a fog of bitter disillusionment.

The rest of the novel narrates an increasingly complex plot hatched by the Circus, the British spy agency Leamas works for, to recover from the elimination of their spy network by getting back at the German spymaster responsible - Mundt.

The plot begins with Leamas acting the part of a disgruntled agent, shortchanged for his service to his country and vulnerable to defection. He is contacted by agents for East Germany and agrees to supply them with information, but not before he takes a job in a library where he meets and becomes lovers with Liz Gold, a character who will come to represent the innocent bystanders who get pulled into the world of morally questionable espionage with tragic results.

Almost everything that happens in this novel is morally questionable on both sides and that is what provides a good bit of the intellectual stimulation of the book. John Le Carre always keeps the big picture ideology within the frame of the story by having his characters invoke Communist ideology alongside ideas of Democracy. Without going too deeply into political science, politics is always a reasonable topic of conversation here whether its pillow talk between Alec and Liz or a discussion of their greater mission between Alec and his Communist counterparts.

But Le Carres focus is always on real people and he loves to explore the way that the idealism of the East and the West get twisted and distorted in their effects on both those spies who must compete aggressively for their side as well as the innocent people who are just doing their jobs. At one point Alec refers to this as turning the plan into people, in other words, to achieve some results in intelligence work, agents must be used and people will die and these deaths flatly contradict the western democracies ideological support for the freedom of the individual.

These moral concerns fit neatly into a novel which is full of betrayals and double-crossings. The way information is doled out as the plot unfolds changes the way you see the characters and what you make of their motives but it all circles back to the Berlin Wall and an ending which parallels the opening.

Leamass bitterness proves to be wholly justified, but his downfall is brought about by his inexplicable hunger for operational life. His embittered attitude is perhaps most directed at his own profession, one to which he is drawn like a magnet. Of spying he has this to say: What do you think spies are: priests, saints and martyrs? Theyre a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives. Its a great diatribe which encapsulates the mood, the atmosphere, the tensions, and the overriding philosophy of this novel.

Coming in from the cold has many meanings here. Leamas comes in from the cold when his East German network gets wrapped up and he flies back to London, he comes in from the cold when he leaves the Circus to work at the library as a discarded alcoholic former spy, he comes in from the cold when he agrees to sell information to the East Germans, and finally he comes in from the cold when he ends up back at the Berlin Wall in the final scene. With shifty characters, a torturous plot, and a warm core of humane sympathy this novel is an entertaining and philosophical spy novel for the thinking reader.",1517270400,5

6384,162,1800,">>>>> My Synopsis (Review follows): <<<<<
Jack Garrett has one of the biggest egos you'll ever see. He thinks he's god's gift to woman. While some of it is well founded--he's gorgeous, will treat a woman right (for the one night he's with them), and a sweet talker--he's got his flaws. His main one is he doesn't do relationships. When a cute redhead with an Irish accent and a long standing fascination with organized crime doesn't instantly succumb to his charms, he becomes intrigued.

Katie McCoy is a straight laced, Catholic raised, Olympic gold medalist in the air rifle competition, and more proficient with fire arms than just about anyone else around. She's part of the Garda Emergency Response Unit, the elite Police Tactical Unit of the Garda Siochana, the national police force of Ireland. She's come to New York as part of the International Police Exchange Program and is looking forward to two weeks of freedom. For the past four years she's trained relentlessly for the Olympics under the thumb of her father. She's looking forward to finally living a little. She has a list of what she wants to do over the next two weeks and Jack is not on her agenda. When she finds out that he's going to be under her tutelage, along with the rest of his unit, for the next two weeks she feels a torrid love affair with this infuriatingly handsome man would be way too complicated. But maybe, just maybe it'd be worth it?

>>>>> My Review: <<<<<
This is the second book in The Academy series and it can be read as standalone. You may, however, wish to read the first book because I believe it captured the friendship dynamic between Jack, Danika, and Charlie a little better. I'm having so much fun reading about this trio and watching them fall one by one. Charlie and Jack are a little rough around the edges but they're all heart. I look forward to reading more about Danika in the next book and Charlie's brother, lieutenant Burns.

My first impression of Jack was that he was way too cocky. As he opens up and reveals some of his inner demons, however, we learn there's more to this man than just another pretty face. He just doesn't know it. Katie inspires him to look deep inside himself and figure out what he wants out of life. No ones ever expected much out of he so he never expected much of himself. Katie, however, sees something no one but his friends have, and encourages him to become the man she knows he's capable of being. I rather liked that about her.

Katie turned out to be not quite what I first expected. While I figured she was smart and strong, she was tougher than I would have given her credit for when we're first introduced to her. Jack's reaction to the thought of her sporting fire arms had me laughing. The boy's got it bad at the beginning of this book, and I could just imagine the goofy grin lighting up his face as he thought about her. Katie is by no means a push over and refuses to settle. Jack has to come up to snuff because she'll accept nothing less. It's the way she was raised.

I couldn't help but give this one 5 out of 5 roses. I liked how the author via Katie made Jack face up to his problem and get help. I also loved how Katie inspired him to be all that he could be. The two made a cute couple and I loved how the story didn't have that cookie cutter feel about it, and I found it surprisingly refreshing. Jack didn't win me over at the beginning but by the end, I simply adored him. On the Romance Rating Scale, this one earned a SHOWER rating--a cold shower is necessary (need I say more?). Some books should come with a warning--make sure your significant other is handy or your shower is in working order.",1517356800,5
6385,1081,282,"First off, I would like to thank the publisher and author for providing me this ARC to review. Please note that the version I read was an advanced copy, and certain events/language may be changed in the published edition.

Stars (Out of 10): 6/10 Stars

Overall Thoughts: I liked this book, but didn't love it. It was a quick and enjoyable read, but wasn't the most unique in terms of characters or plot. But it still managed to draw me in, and I was pretty invested in the relationship by the end! I would have liked to see some more scenes better developed, and the solutions to the differing plot lines as well.

The Good: A good ending with closure, overall a decent and interesting book. A likable cast of characters for the most part as well.

The Bad: In terms of plot, seemed plain, somewhat unoriginal and matching the standard cliche of YA romance. In addition, some loose ends were never brought up again or resolved.

SPOILERS BEGIN HERE

The Characters: While I liked the cast of characters for the most part, some issues between them weren't fully resolved, especially between Jeff, Dallin, and Autumn. I would have liked to see a better and more secure ending for them, and a better explanation of what they standing was by the end of the book. However, I did find Autumns anxiety to be pretty realistic (compared to experiences Ive had with friends with anxiety), and I felt it did add another layer to the story.

The Plot: For the most part, this was fairly standard. Perfect, popular girl has whole life set up with a sporty jock. However, an event happens where she meets the typical bad boy, and her love life is suddenly thrown upside down. And, this perfect girl actually has this super secret secret that she just HAS to hide from her friends because theyll judge her. And in the end, some vague reason that girl doesnt like jock anymore, and goes with bad boy, and her friends all accept her secret, like we all knew they would from the start. But hey, I still enjoyed it. (My only other issue with the plot is the sudden disappearance of the idea that her friends didn't realize she wasn't there? And Jeff being a total jerk and trying to give Dax the wrong idea in the end?)

The Favorite Character: Lisa was a pretty good friend for most of the book, so I have to go with her.",1517356800,3
6386,1092,266,"I never really thought I would read this book, since I am a fairly tidy person already, but it came up as a recommended title on my librarys app and I decided to give it a chance. Since this book was such a huge bestseller, I had already heard many of the tips featured here. Her emphasis on first getting rid of anything that doesnt spark joy in your life is good advice, though I found it impractical when thinking about some of the things in my daily life that are necessary but don't necessarily give me joy (such as the yoga pants I wear when I work or the special shampoo I put in my hair to keep my hair healthy). The book, overall, was helpful and gave me some new ideas for when I do spring cleaning this year.",1517356800,4
6387,711,930,"The mark of well-written historical fiction is when readers forget that they are reading about events that actually happened and are able to lose themselves inside the story. This speaks directly to the talents of the storyteller. Fortunately, the writer in this case is Robert Harris, who has been referred to as the smartest bestselling author in the world.

World War II, as told from the British perspective, has received a lot of play during the movie awards season that has just begun. Two of the best films of the year are Dunkirk, which depicts the turning point for the European allies in WWII, and The Darkest Hour, which features an award-winning turn for the great Gary Oldman as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill towards the end of the war.

Harris now releases MUNICH, which deals with an 11th-hour international meeting in September 1938 that sees the British Prime Minister and his team attempting to avert another world war. The problem is that the person they need to persuade against nefarious actions, like invading Czechoslovakia, is German leader and head of the Nazi Party Adolf Hitler, who is not a person to be reasoned with. It also does not help matters that one of the other European representatives involved in the meetings is his lackey, Benito ""Il Duce"" Mussolini of Italy.

Going back to my first comment on MUNICH, what makes it such a masterful novel is that you actually go through the feeling of suspense surrounding well-known historical events, hoping against hope that maybe the Allied Forces will succeed in stopping Hitler in his tracks before he can get started. Perhaps, if that were to occur, the millions of lives lost in the war and millions of people who were murdered at the hands of Hitler's Nazi forces might never have to endure that fate.

Alas, even knowing the actual outcome does not keep MUNICH from being a truly enjoyable read. Since this is the early days before the conflict was eventually named World War II, the Brits may not fully realize the importance of stopping Hitler from invading both the Czech Republic and neighboring Austria. The Prime Minister at that time was Neville Chamberlain, a brilliant man who had to eventually step aside so the far stronger-willed Winston Churchill could take the reigns in an effort to stop the Nazi takeover of the world.

That brings me to the two principal characters in this thriller: Hugh Legat, a private secretary and rising star under Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Paul von Hartmann, a staff member of the German Foreign Office. What makes them so interesting is not the fact that they are on opposite sides of the Munich Conference negotiations, but that they were classmates and friends while attending Oxford.

Hugh Legat feels so guilty as he all but assured his boss that the German people wanted nothing but peace, and that after the Munich Conference there would be no more territorial problems in Europe. He had risen in prominence within Britain and became noticed by Chamberlain due to the fact that his first superior --- a man named Wigram --- had taken his own life. Legat has much to prove. He is initially passed over when the team is being put together to go to Munich. A last-minute change sees his name added to the list, and thus he has an opportunity to make a name for himself while preventing another world war so soon after the previous one had ended.

On the other side, we have Paul von Hartmann. Possibly due to his prior relationship with Legat, or the fact that he was Oxford-schooled and able to see things on a global scale and not just with nationalized blinders on, Hartmann realizes that Herr Hitler was already off the rails and needed to be slowed down, if not outright stopped. The question, and the main source of suspense here, is how Legat and Hartmann can work together while on opposite sides of the table to ensure a resolution is found that favors everyone and brings a halt to any future death and destruction.

Even though Hitler and his team put on faces of cooperation while at the table, a letter is found that was authored by Hitler and speaks to German forces smashing Czechoslovakia via military action in the near future. The Oxford classmates are not blind to the fact that it may be a losing battle, but they must attempt to do something to salvage things before they get further out of control. This will require Legat and Hartmann, who had not been in touch with each other for years, to resurface past secrets and face them anew in an effort to bring forth the possibility for peace in Europe. It also will involve artful treachery, behavior bordering on treason and serious decisions that move against their own conscience to even have a chance at being successful.

Whenever I read a work of historical fiction, I like to do my own research. This is a great byproduct of a good reading experience as it allows me to learn new things or see history from a different point of view. Strangely enough, I could not find anything written about Hugh Legat or Paul von Hartmann. As a result, my respect for Robert Harris is that much higher; if these characters are indeed fictional, they are brilliantly conceived. It is hard to imagine the events surrounding the Munich Conference without those two young men, which is why MUNICH is such an effective and engaging read.

6389,214,1800,"I love Tessa Bailey and Im OBSESSED with Indecent Exposure. Im just going to get that off my chest. *phew* I adored this book so much, I read it twice  once to be able to enjoy and savor the story, and a second time to take notes for my review. Unsurprisingly, it was amazing both times, thanks in large part to Jack Garrett. Going in to this book, I was dying to get to know more about Jack, the roguish bad boy officer-in-training at the Police Academy. Charlies womanizing roommate left a lasting impression in Disorderly Conduct and has stolen the show (along with my heart) in Indecent Exposure. With a narrative thats as complex and riveting as its male protagonist, a heroine thats fierce and fun-loving, and a romance thats the textbook definition of swoon-worthy, Indecent Exposure is another unforgettable love story by Tessa Bailey.

Tessa Bailey and cop romances are an incomparable pairing. This author has created a number of noteworthy uniformed heroes, but I have to say that shes outdone herself with Jack Garrett. There are many words that could be used to describe Jack  charming, confident, seductive, incorrigible, and damaged, to name a few  but none of them would come close to scratching the surface of his character. The man is so complicated that his baggage has baggage but, to the outside world, hes high-spirited and carefree, spending his days as a reluctant Academy recruit, and his nights drowning in booze and women. When Jack approaches Katie McCoy outside of a bar, hes immediately attractive to the redheaded Irish spitfire, but shes nothing like the other girls who occupy his bed for one night. Its only the next day after the two share an earth-shattering, spark-filled kiss that a wrench is thrown in their would-be romantic connection.

Coming to New York for two weeks as a special instructor at the Police Academy gives Katie McCoy a chance to get a break from her stifling, monotonous everyday life and tackle a to-do list of activities thatll bring some fun and excitement into her life. Shes a woman with a plan, except that plan didn't include a crush on her handsome pupil. Their potent chemistry and untamable attraction makes it difficult for Jack and Katie to keep their interactions strictly professional, especially when Katies to-do list includes gaining sexual experience via a wild fling and Jack is more than happy to lend his expertise. Its when they start breaking down each others barriers, emotionally and physically, that their relationship evolves from playful, easy-going, and jaw-droppingly erotic, to heartbreakingly beautiful, hopelessly romantic, and unexpectedly sweet.

With Indecent Exposure, Tessa Bailey takes the stereotypes of the virgin and the playboy and turns them on their axis, interjecting heart and soul into the backstories of its hero and heroine. These characters will make you laugh, make you smile, make you swoon, and make you fall in love. Theyll devastate you, overwhelm your emotions, break your heart into a dozen pieces, and put it back together. Their story is raw and messy but its also filled with hope and healing. Ive read and loved all of Tessa Baileys books but Indecent Exposure is easily one of my top favorites by this author.

6390,52,1778,"Kylie is a woodworker in the same complex where Joe, a security/private contractor, works. They hang out with the same group of friends until the night Kylie and Joe share a steamy kiss. So when Kylie comes to Joe for help because an heirloom was stolen and is being held for ransom, he's glad to volunteer as he wants more of those kisses.
I usually like Jill Shalvis because the romance is great and the stories have their funny moments. I liked Kylie and Joe both a lot, but I had some trouble seeing them together. There was something that just didn't seem to mesh (for me, anyway). The secondary characters are fun, especially Vinnie the dog and Joe's father. But the search for the missing heirloom seemed more contrived than dangerous; I kept expecting it to turn into a scavenger hunt prank by the friends rather than ending up with guns and arson, something I don't usually get from a Shalvis novel.
I also was distracted by some poor editing. They get undressed but leave their work boots on; I was taken out of the moment trying to figure out how they got their jeans and underwear off over the boots. Vinnie the dog is in Joe's truck, but when Joe walks Kylie to the door and there's a scene there, Vinnie is nowhere to be found. So I'm wondering if Joe is taking Vinnie home or if he's running around the yard rather than paying much attention to the dialogue happening at the door. Stuff like this takes the reader out of the story, and I don't usually see this in Ms. Shalvis's books.
Anyway, I am looking forward to the next book which I think is Molly and Lucas.",1517356800,3

Ill admit the premise of a stolen penguin carving seemed out there at first but trust Jill Shalvis to turn it into an addictive story line.

This book was filled with Shalviss trademark humor and great romance but there was also a good dose of mystery tossed in. I thought I had the guilty party pegged a few times and then would find out I was wrong. I love when Im kept guessing and the culprit isn't immediately obvious. I also was happy to see a few new characters fleshed out which I hope means this series is going to continue on by featuring their romances.

My Review:

This was my first Jill Shalvis experience, silly me, I have been missing out. I adored her clever wry humor, breezy storytelling, and endearingly flawed and quirky characters.  About That Kiss was a delightfully entertaining and engaging read that was easy to follow and never failed to hold my interest.  Despite being the fifth book in a series, the story stood alone and on solid terra firma.  And I while I never felt lost or confused without previous knowledge, I am sure I would enjoy going backward and acquainting myself with the earlier stories of this lively and alluring group.  Each chapter was titled with a popular line from a movie that never failed to bring a smirk to my face if one wasn't already in place.  More, please.",1517356800,5
6393,96,468,"After reading Weir's ""The Martian"" I had a chance to ask him via e-mail if he really thought an astronaut, marooned on Mars, keeping a log would use profanity in virtually every line. I noted that while I am no prude, profanity loses its impact when it becomes simply part of the vernacular. ""Guess I'm just a potty mouth!"" was his reply.

Well, the potty mouth is back. I guess it is a millennial trait (sorry, I don't think the unsympathetic protagonist would qualify as a millennial far enough into the future to be living in a moon colony, but she has the profanity skills down pat).

That issue aside, this book shares some of the positive traits of his first effort - solid grounding in physics and science and an interesting story. Certainly great escapism and will make a fun movie.

6396,92,1803,"Whats it About? Despite being handed over to a common woman, Mick Trewlove has risen above his status to become a rich and successful businessman, yet in his eyes theres still one more thing he hasn't accomplished: Revenge against the duke that fathered him then abandoned him to an unknown fate. Mick devises a plan to ruin the dukes legitimate son, the earl of Kipling. And for the final blow, Mick plans on stealing Kips fiance, Lady Aslyn Hastings away from him. Lady Aslyn grew up the sheltered ward of Kips parents and it was always expected that she would marry their son. However, when she meets Mick, shes immediately drawn to him and as she gets to know him she finds that he understands her more than she thought anyone would. When the truth finally comes out, Mick has to decide what he wants more, revenge or Aslyn.

Overall reaction to the story? I ADORE a good revenge romance and Beyond Scandal and Desire is exactly that. I love that moment when the hero, so hell bent on revenge for whatever reason ends up head over heels in love and is desperate to keep the woman hes fallen in love with. As an author, Lorraine Heath instinctively knows how to grab and hold an audiences attention. She has such a passionate way of telling a story with equal parts desire, longing, and reality. Beyond Scandal and Desire brought to light both the good but mostly awful practice of baby farming which was one of the ways people disposed of their illegitimate or unwanted offspring. The fact that Heath could build a romance like Beyond Scandal and Desire around a tough subject like that just wowed the pants off of me.

Describe the hero in five words: Determined. Intelligent. Caring. Indulgent. Encouraging.
Did you like him? Oh yeah!
Why? On the surface Mick seems like a one track minded brute, a typical bastard who wants what he feels is owed to him but within a chapter or two the real Mick quickly shows up and that guy is worth falling in love with. I loved the way he treated his real family with kindness and gave them everything they never had when he was younger. He indulged his sisters with their unconventional wishes but at the same time he guarded them fiercely. I loved how accepting he was of Aslyns wish for adventure and how he encouraged her to just be herself no matter what. Mick was successful because he worked so hard and didn't step on anyone to get there, it was all him and he turned around and helped those who were like him when he was a kid. You have to love that about him.

Describe the heroine in five words: Smart. Compassionate. Nurturing. Loyal. Rational.
Did you like her? Absolutely.
Why? Admittedly I was nervous about Aslyn, she grew up so sheltered that I was afraid shed be a big bore because she was so innocent but she wasn't at all. She was sheltered, nave, and ignorant of the real world outside of her pretty gowns, social standing, and lavish meals but she wasn't stupidly ignorant which would have been a big no for me. In fact, Aslyn didn't take long to start questioning the long held beliefs of her class, her guardians, or even her own personal beliefs and I loved that! She was a thinker, and a rebel waiting to come out. Her growth was the most interesting in Beyond Scandal and Desire, she went from a typical society lady to a saucy temptress who voiced her opinions and her intentions without fear. I loved that she wasn't prone to hysterics when she was in a tough spot, she was calm, logical, and strong.

Lets talk about the romance: From the start Mick and Aslyn had an electric chemistry that was desire on his part and curiosity on hers. From there, Mick orchestrated random encounters, secret outings, and revealing conversations that allowed these two to move past the lust and infatuation stage and onto something more real and worth fighting for. As a couple Mick and Aslyn complimented each other so well, he was used to caring only for the people like him and his family but Aslyn showed him that not all aristocrats were the same and that there was more to life than revenge. Mick showed Aslyn that with the right people she could be herself and that no matter what, she should always do and say what she felt. What made them so special though was how Lorraine Heath took the time to build their emotional relationship before she moved forward with their physical one. I felt that gave the moment Aslyn finds out the truth more of an impact with Mick because at that point they were already so involved with one another.

  She held up a hand. No, no, no. The trousers go.
  Later.
  Now.
  He held her gaze. Youve never seen a man when hes aroused. Let me ease you into it.
  No.
  Aslyn
  Were going to come to this bed as equals.
  He gave a brusque nod. As you wish.

How about that supporting cast? Mick has a delightful family made up of bastards, each with their own personalities and conflicts. Any of them would make an exciting lead character but I was fascinated by his sister Gillian whom his mother dressed as a boy when she was a child in order to protect her. As an adult Gilly hasn't lost her fondness for male clothing and Mick indulged her with a tavern to run which she does splendidly. She really grabbed my attention because I want to know why she shuns everything her younger sister Fancy embraces. I want to know if Gilly is really as tough as she seems (I hope so). But in truth all of Micks siblings are worthy of their own stories, as is Kip, Aslyns fiance. Id like him to redeem himself and find someone to love. He wasn't bad, just incredibly selfish and narrow minded.

Click It or Skip It? Click It. Lorraine Heaths first book in the Sins for all Seasons is a real winner and if Micks story is anything to go by, the rest of the series is going to be a real treat.

I jumped into this series with this book, yes its the seventh book, but I have heard so many amazing things about it and I just know Ill never have the time to start at the beginning so I figured this was the perfect opportunity to see what all the hype is about.

I can totally see why this is such a popular series, there is something unique and unconventional about Sunday Silence. I think its a combination of a few key ingredients, the main character is a psychologist and police consultant giving a fresh point of view and the pacing was unlike many other novels. Oftentimes thrillers/police procedurals are set over the course of just a few days, maybe a few weeks but this is spread out over a few months which made it seem so much more realistic to me. Just because the timeline was more stretched out doesnt mean that the suspense is lacking, in fact it was very intense and the sense of danger was heavy throughout.

This was a calculating read, both in terms of the storyline and the killer. This was deftly plotted, the authors are skilled at creating an elaborate labyrinth that I never managed to work out on my own. The cast of characters is eccentric and interesting and I can see how long time readers of the series would have an emotional attachment to them. If you're already a fan, I think you're in for a treat! If you're a newbie like me I would recommend giving this a shot!

6398,852,1800,"Tessa Bailey's second sexy romance in The Academy series looks at a hero with issues whose involvement with a visiting firearms instructors is the catalyst for positive changes in his life and a brighter future.

Jack Garrett is getting through his police officer training one day at a time, and a drink at a time too. Being numb helps him forget about the more painful parts of his childhood, part of which involved being raised in a brothel by his mother, who used to be a sex worker. Having a steady paying job is his way of keeping her out of that business. When he meets a beautiful, quirky woman lurking outside a bar, his first instinct is to get her into his bed. She's having none of that but will accept his companionship for the evening - a good thing since it turns out she's his new firearms instructor.

Katie McCoy is an Olympic medalist markswoman, ready to be retired from the training and stress of competition but still happy to use her skills.  On a two week assignment in New York, she plans to intersperse her firearms training classes at the police academy with knocking off things from her NYC bucket list. Having a wild love affair is on there and it's not long before the always charming Jack convinces her that he'd be happy to show her the ropes while she's in town. Jack has secrets, ones he realizes he wants to share with Katie. But will opening up about his past push away the girl he wants in his future?

I am a longtime fan of Tessa Bailey, and she's written a challenging hero here, a man who uses alcohol and sex to forget about his past, while at the same time not letting himself plan for a future either. Jack meeting Katie, a woman who is determined to enjoy her newfound freedom after years of intense training, helps him to address things he'd hidden away. Along the way, Jack and Katie have a very passionate affair, one where sex becomes much more nuanced for Jack, and eye opening for Katie, previously a virgin. Their love scenes have the requisite 'dirty talking' that the author is known for, but also become emotional and intimate as Jack falls for Katie and vice versa. Told from both perspectives in first person point of view, there are some bumps and bruises along the way to their happy ending, but it's worth the wait.

Stars (Out of 10): 10/10 Stars

Overall Thoughts: I forgot the reasons why this has been one of my favorite books for so long, and reading it again only solidified that, rather than lowering my opinion of it. The way Mafi writes is so unique, and so emotional, that it completely draws us in and puts us in tune with the characters emotions. Her characters are also magnificent and so diverse, from the comedic relief but still deep Kenji, to a broken but strong Juliette, and to the morally ambiguous Aaron, who has learned how to deal with his hardships in the only way he can. This book will never bore me, no matter how many times I read it or how well I know what will happen next, and will continue to stay on my list of favorites for years to come. Overall a great finale to one of my favorite series.

SPOILERS BEGIN HERE

The Good: One of my favorite things about Mafis books is her writing style. Its always been very unique, and seems to show an entirely different level of emotion in her characters. I also loved the characters in this book, and how we see how the aftermath of their loss in unravel me affect them.

The Bad: Still hoped for an epilogue or a plan for an after, as ending wise it was a tad abrupt. However, I understand that in order to lengthen the ending and provide more closure, a whole new plot wouldve had to be introduced, so in a way, this was a good ending as well.

The Characters: I still cant get over the growth and redemption we see for Aaron, as his actions are explained, and we actually get to understand his character. This book is what sealed the deal for him as one of my favorite characters, since we start to see his vulnerabilities and flaws. Im also glad they semi resolved Juliette x Adam, and the whole brother plot. I also love that a bit more depth was added to Kenji, with him still remaining the comic relief all the same.

The Plot: While reading it 4-5 times sort of kills the surprise from the plot, I still really enjoy it. I love the flip we see in Aaron, and the inside view we then have, and the characters have, to launch their rebellion from. I also loved the fact that Juliette was able to harness her killing touch as well, and makes her fully free.

The World Building: While most of the world building is done in the first two books, we still continue to learn little bits and pieces of how things work, and how the powers in this world works. However, this was definitely not the point of this book.

The Favorite Character: Aaron (obviously, since hes one of my favorite characters ever in general)

I know I will be in the minority here, but this book just really wasn't a five star read for me at all. I wanted to like the book. Unfortunately, I just could not finish it.

About halfway through I began to feel like it was a chore to try and finish it. After the third time of checking it out from the library, I finally just gave up.",1517356800,2
6403,1073,1814,"This book is an anthology, and normally I won't really read anthologies unless there's a story in it that moves along a story line for a series I'm reading. I usually discover that due to their length, the stories are rushed and lack depth, as was the case here. It was an easy, light for the month of April, since all of the stories related to April Fool's Day pranks, but there were definitely both positives and negatives.

Fooling Around by Vicki Lewis Thompson: This story had me chuckling a few times. It's the story of three friends (Lena, Brandy, and Meg) who developed a bond during a weekend motivational seminar, and hatched the idea for their April Fool's Club. Every year during the ten day period surrounding April 1st, the women dreamt up squirm-worthy stunts for each other designed to build strength of character by breaking through their ""fool factor"". Lena was the main character, and her required stunt focused on her asking out the cutest single guy she knows. She needs to tell him it's for dinner, light entertainment, and dancing, and to dress accordingly. Then she needs to take him for fast food, a belly-dancing lesson, and goofy golf. She asks her crush Andre, he accepts, and there are the usual ""complications"", including the old work scenario, etc. Insta-love and quick bed-hopping. A shallow, slightly funny story.

Nobody's Fool by Stephanie Bond: I really didn't like the hero of this story at all. I thought he was a mean-spirited individual who suddenly does a 180 once he ""realizes"" that he's going to hurt the heroine with his ""prank"". I think she should have punched him in the nose instead of hopping into bed with him. Completely unbelievable.

Fools Rush In by Judith Arnold: I'm torn about this one. The whole premise for the story is a bit odd. The hero is a manager at a radio station, and for April Fool's Day, one of the disc-jockeys announces his engagement to a specific lady over the air. For some reason, he can't just go on the air himself and refute this, and it causes a big headache for him since he's just been voted ""one of the top 5 bachelors in Boston"". (I swear, if I'd heard that line one more time...) The hero meets the heroine, their families get involved, and there's a huge case of ""insta-love"". The only thing that saved the story was that the author made the hero out to be a really nice guy. So nice, in fact, that I'd be interested in reading a novel by Judith Arnold just to see if with the proper story length, a better story line can be found.

So overall, just meh.

Stars (Out of 10): 7.5/10
Overall Thoughts: I really enjoyed this book, and how it's written and planned out is different from most fantasy novels. It actually reminded me of how Game of Thrones is formatted, or atleast how I've heard it's formatted, as I haven't read the series yet. There were some parts of the author's style that needed getting used to, such as how frequently she killed off characters and how she went about making those deaths seem important, but I believe that now that I understand Rhodes' style more the rest of the series will seem a bit better. I do believe that with it's flaws, it was still a really good book, and I truly enjoyed it!

SPOILERS BEGIN HERE

The Good: I loved the diversity of the characters, as how they reacted to things was actually quite different from each other. I also enjoyed how the main characters aren't on the same side, so we almost have to choose who we believe is good, and who we want to 'win'.

The Bad: I thought the character deaths seemed a bit too constant, and made the lives of those characters way less important. I also thought that the love of Theon and Cleo was pretty instantaneous, which was a trope I was never truly a fan of.

The Characters: While I loved the characters, I wasn't really a fan of how they died. It was frequent and sometimes unnecessary, with some not really seeming to make a big impact. I do realize that Basilius and Tomas were very important deaths, as they actually moved the plot forward, but the deaths of Theon, King Corvin, and Emilia were a few of the ones that weren't fully made into a plot device yet. However, I hope to see those deaths being put to use in the second book!

The Plot: I enjoyed the plot of this book, but I do feel it was a bit ""plain."" Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was also simple. Three countries want power, two gang up on the other, then stronger country betrays weaker country. Even the personal plotlines never truly surprised me, as when there was a twist, it was heavily, very heavily, hinted at, such as Lucia being the orphan child in the prologue and Gauis betraying Basilius. However, the author concealed her plot of the Kindred and magic well, as I did not guess Eirene was the Watcher, and that Cleo would be Eva's descendant.

The World Building: I really enjoyed how they built the world, from it's history to it's current, and gave real reasons for why the war was happening, and why everyone agreed to it. I especially like how the religion and magic was built, and that was definitely one of my favorite aspects of the book.

Stars (Out of 10): 6/10 Stars

Overall Thoughts: While Im not the biggest fan of this book, it was still pretty good. I enjoyed reading it, but it by far was not one of my favorite books/children books. I have the next few books in the series though, so I might end up continuing it just because the books are easily accessible. But overall, I just was kinda bored by it.

The Good: Decent plot, and I liked how there wasn't really a good or bad side, and you couldve honestly supported either side and been happy with the outcome. I also liked the humor in this novel, and overall it wasn't as childish as I thought it would be!

The Bad: Didnt actually connect with any of the characters, and while yes I could support either side, I ended up not liking either. Also, nothing of the plot was really surprising, and Im not usually the biggest fan of the main character being overly powerful/smart in a way that almost doesnt make sense.

SPOILERS BEGIN HERE

The Characters: I didn't end up caring for any of the characters, honestly. Artemis, while kinda cool, just felt kinda shallow and inhuman, but I do see the author trying to create a path of development (showing Artemis joke more), so Im curious to see where that goes. The fae, on the other hand, weren't focused on in a way that would make me like separate characters, but I did end up liking Holly, even if some decisions or facts weren't fully explained, like why she never bothered to refill her magic if she was so ambitious to grow in her career.

The Plot: This part was fairly interesting, and was mainly the reason I kept reading, I wanted to know how it all ended! I actually was quite happy how it ended in a way to keep both sides happy (but still wanting to take more from the other), and I love how Artemis was made a bit more human by using his wish to save his mother, which will definitely be an interesting dynamic (her influence) to see played out in the rest of the series!

The World Building: The fae were depicted in a curious way, as an underground race of people with magic. It was definitely different, and made the story very unique in its own right, but I do feel it couldve been developed a bit better. But I can hope for that for the rest of the series!

The narration by Claire Danes was phenomenal and reading the book was almost as thrilling as seeing the series (which I had done back in June).

6409,138,232,"Perhaps quoting from Freddie Mercurys Bohemian Rhapsody best puts what many consider the finest of Philip K. Dicks works into perspective: Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Ambiguity threads its way throughout The Man in the High Castle, because ambiguity is the whole point of the novel. Is the timeline followed by the characters in the novel reality? Or, is true reality, as Juliana comes to believe, that expressed in the alternative reality book most in the novel are reading, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy? Perhaps chance dictates the path of a life or a country, and divining whats to come means foreseeing with mystical help, as, again, most of the characters do employing I Ching (Book of Changes). The layering Dick accomplishes makes The Man in the High Castle a terrific reading experience, a novel guaranteed to elevate a persons anxiety level.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philip-K-Dick-Four-Novels-of-the-1960s/dp/1598530097/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philip K. Dick: Four Novels of the 1960s</a>&nbsp;tells two alternative histories to what we accept as our reality. First is that which seems like reality to the characters and to readers. The Axis powers won WWII, they have divided the U.S. into the Pacific States of America (Japan), the Eastern States (Germany), and the Rocky Mountain buffer zone; further, Germany still seeks out Jews for extermination, and have pretty much killed everybody in Africa, as well as the Slavs. Roma, etc.; and they have an active space program, to boot. The second alternative history has the Allies winning WWII. However, the new order does not resemble the reality we known. America has resolved many of its problems, including its inherent racism. Great Britain, now both racist and expansionist, reigns as Americas rival. The Soviet Union has collapsed.

Readers experience this reality through the eyes and thoughts of the main characters: Robert Childan, owner of an American antique shop in San Francisco, who finds himself constantly kowtowing to his new masters, the Japanese; Nobusuke Tagomi, head of the Japanese trade mission, who, like many occupiers, is fascinated by American artifacts and buys from Childan; Frank Frink, whose real name is Fink, a Jew in hiding, a master artisan of fake antiques, who launches his own company; Baynes, who actually is Rudolf Wegener on a mission to reveal to the Japanese the German plans to nuke the Home Islands; and Juliana Frink, who lives in Colorado, where she hooks up with Joe Cinnadella, a Nazi assassin sent to kill Hawthorne Abendsen, author of the alternative history within this alternative history, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy.

You certainly can read much into the story Dick weaves, and many have. Dick constantly asks us to ponder what is real and what isnt. He doesnt explicitly ask the question, but this theme runs throughout the novel. For instance, a customer complains that Childan has sold him a fake antique gun as an original. Childan discovers that his supplier is fabricating items to appear as antiques. Whats real and what isnt, and, more perplexing, does knowing matter? On a larger scale, by the end were challenged to wonder which is reality, the story we have read, or the one weve glimpsed in excerpts and discussions of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy? Have we crossed over into another reality when we follow Julianna into Abendsens home, which turns out to be anything but a fortress.

Then there are the issues of chance and change, the ideas the future lived by the characters was somehow ordained and immutable, much as we might believe the outcome of WWII could not have been other than it was because it is our reality. Dick has the various characters addressing these questions of reality by resorting to the I Ching for answers about the fortuity of an event, or what might await them should they take one action or another. Frank Frink, for instance, tries to determine if he should start his own business. He receives an answer that appears contradictory; in other words, ambiguous.

Finally, why does any of it matter anyway, what the characters do, what we ourselves do? Look to the book title The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. It compresses the ideas expressed in Ecclesiastes 12:5 into a short phrase, those ideas being: All things come to an end, the world we know moves on, and can become a world different from what we know.

So, fellow readers, enjoy the ambiguity that is The Man in the High Castle.",1517356800,4

Stars (Out of 10): 7/10 Stars

Overall Thoughts: I finally got around to reading this book, after hearing major hype about it over the past year or so, and I have to say it pretty much lived up to it. I was extremely hooked on to the beginning of the book, and the build up of the characters, their situations, and the plot. While I liked the ending less, and maybe it would have been better to read the entire book in one sitting, I still did enjoy it.

The Good: Interesting characters, interesting plot, had me hooked then heartbroken. Also, a main issue that I often find with books dealing with mental illness or other traits that lead to discrimination (such as characters in the LGBT community) is that those traits are often what makes up that character entirely, rather than just affecting an existing personality. I am super happy to report that this book did not feel like that at all, as Finch was an actual person, not just a walking mental illness. In addition, I also felt this book did not try to beautify or promote having a mental illness, another thing books and social media sometimes does, and manages to realistically show the tough parts of it, while still making Finch be a completely normal person. In this sense, I felt the book did a fantastic job.

The Bad: Didnt care much for the ending, some parts felt unrealistic, or that connection to the characters dropped off for a bit, before it getting better again for the last few chapters.

SPOILERS BEGIN HERE

The Characters: I really liked how the characters all clicked together. No, Violet and Finch lives weren't puzzles that just found their missing piece, as there were moments you could see their different pasts and upbringings coming into play, but they still ended up having a great, at least in the beginning, relationship. In addition, I also like how realistic all the relationships felt, and how they seemed to actually have meaningful impacts on the people Violet and Finch became. Lastly, I am glad this wasn't another YA book where the parents seemingly don't care or disappear as the teenagers go on magical adventures and bond. There were consequences that matched the situation (and their parents parenting style) whenever Finch or Violet lied, or disappeared, or did things they shouldnt have.

The Plot: I am happy with everything but the ending. No, I am not just mad that Finch died. I am just frustrated with how the author wrote that particular part of the story. During the beginning of the end, we saw no more input from Finch, when the readers were used to near constant chapters and input from him. Yes, it was necessary to make the actual ending more impactful, but it felt kinda rough, and it felt weird suddenly missing a character, even though they weren't yet dead at that point (although I guess this is how Violet went through it.) In addition, I didn't like how Violet ended up hanging out with Ryan again somehow, and while she didn't want anything more again, they kissed. And this was all while Finch was still missing, not yet dead. I get her moving on, it was just weird she went back to a guy that she said she would never want again, and it seemed to show a regression in the character Violet had become/was becoming, and almost deleting all the progress towards being herself she had made.

6417,63,1181,"This book is a collection of 4 short stories. Aloft was my favorite, followed by Snapshot, then Rain and finally Loaded.
I also really enjoyed reading the Afterword part and reading about how Joe Hill came about writing these stories.

The first story is called ""Snapshot"". This story is told by Michael Figlione. Well the adult Michael, who was telling the story of his teenage self, the summer he met the 'Phoenician' or the 'Polaroid Man"" If the Polaroid Man took your picture you would lose part of your memory. This story was okay. I really liked young Michael, He was an overweight teen who did not have any friends, and when his old sitter Shelly started losing her memory (thanks to the Polaroid Man) he would go and watch her when her husband had to go out. This story was a bit sad, especially at then end. 3 1/2 - 4 stars

The second story is called ""Loaded"". Randall Kellaway Is a security guard, and there is a shooting in a jewelry store in the mall. He is considered a hero for taking out the shooter and stopping what could have been a worse situation. But all is not as it seems. and when local journalist Aisha Lanterglass starts digging into the story she uncovers more of what was going on. And as Kellaway's story beings to unravel he starts to lose it. This one really hits home, with all the shootings going on now a days. The beginning part of the story was good, but the ending had me reading faster to find out what was going to happen. But I really wish it ended differently. 3 stars

The third story is called ""Aloft"". I loved this one. Four friends go tandem skydiving in memory of their friend (June) that died of cancer. I went skydiving and loved it, so when I started reading this story it just brought back all the great memories I had. Unfortunately for the main character Aubrey Griffin, the memories will not be so great. First off Aubrey is afraid of heights and scared to death to be sky diving. He thought he could do it but as it got closer to the time to jump he knew he wouldn't be able to do it. But then just as they got to the jump spot they noticed a cloud that looked almost like a spaceship and then the engine of the plane died. So Aubrey and his tandem guide jumped but they hit and landed on the spaceship like cloud. Once the guide unhooked the clips from Aubrey a gust of wind came and pulled him off the cloud and back down to the ground. So now Aubrey is alone on this cloud, that is not a cloud. Anything he thought of would appear, a bed, a tub (and then it rained to fill it), the girl he has the hots for. But try as he might he cannot get off the cloud. It is almost like the cloud does not want him to leave.. Also thrown in were memories Aubry had of his life. 4 1/2 stars

The fourth story is called ""Rain"". This book was creepy. One day in Boulder Colorado (and then the rest of the world) the sky opens up and instead of the rain being water, the rain was very very sharp needles. That tore through anyone who was caught outside. This story is told through Honeysuckle Speck, whose girlfriend and her mother were killed while unpacking her car. Would never have even guessed the ending to this one. Was great. 3 1/2 stars",1517356800,4
6418,378,1805,"This book reminded me of Ediths storyline in Downton Abbey, albeit in a Victorian timeline. Clara is shier and plainer than her pretty, outgoing sister, who has just snagged an advantageous marriage and is off doing a glamorous romantic tour of the continentleaving Clara to run the family newspaper. The boorish editor is positively awful and hates working for a woman, so she has to fire him, and slam out a paper late at night, with the help of her dashing Adonis, who definitely isn't doing it because hes falling in love with her. Shes constantly getting herself in trouble by saying or doing the wrong or awkward thing, hurting people by meddling where she shouldnt. And thenwelland then. Youll just have to read it to find out.

The book was plenty sexy and the main characters were enticing, as they should be in any good romance. I liked that Clara grew from an anxious, shy wallflower to a more confident, goal-oriented business woman. However, she gave Rex all the credit for that growth, instead of allowing it to come from herself, and that bothered me quite a bit. He might have written the article that inspired the change, but he did not climb that ladder, and I hate seeing heroines give all the credit to the man. Thankfully, Rex did seem to give it right back to herhe knew where her internal power was coming from. I just wish she would have accepted it.

The Trouble with True Love was entertaining, but I didn't like it as much as some of the other Avon books Ive read recently. It did appeal to my Downton Abbey obsessionbut, then, Ediths story was never my favorite part of the series.",1517356800,3
6419,464,1805,"4.5 Stars- Rounded

I enjoyed the first in this series and the introduction of Clara as the younger sister to the headstrong and ebullient Irene. But now, with Irene married and on her honeymoon, Clara is left in charge of The Weekly Gazette, and with Irenes prolonging of her honeymoon, she is tasked with filling in as Lady Truelove: an agony aunt column that is the reason for the papers success. Poor Clara isn't confident, always seeing herself as second to her sister: the beautiful, smart, caring and successful (married to a Duke) sister. To make matters worse, shes a true innocent, prone to shyness and uncomfortable in new situations.

Rex had a horrible childhood, alternately ignored and used as a pawn in his parents marriage  their infatuation and obsession with one another led to a disastrous marriage: full of infidelity, harsh words, anger and harsher repercussions.  Having no other real example of love, Rex has convinced himself to never love, indeed hes anti-marriage also, as he struggles to make ends meet after his father cut him off from an allowance and he is living on the kindness of his Aunt Petunia.  But all is not smooth  when he is introduced to Clara  a debutante who seems to have a very low opinion of him that is challenged only by her own lack of confidence, he realizes where he first saw her, and just who she is. See  Clara used a conversation (nearly verbatim) between Rex and his friend Lionel as a way to warn a woman she believed was being ill-used and deceived in her first appearance as Lady Truelove.

Oh this was cute and fun: despite Rexs fury with Claras use of his conversation, there is something so refreshing about her. Not being prone to falling into puddles of mush or conniving to capture his attention (unlike others) hes intrigued by her surety in her often nave moral stance and her offhanded manner of delivering these proclamations.  But, when his friends fury lays him low and the secret identity of Lady Truelove is threatened, he goes to Clara  to threaten / warn her.  Oh their banter (and the tension) is adorable, and Claras ability to take charge and make solid decisions all while unaware of her own abilities speaks to him and a bargain is struck. Hell write the Lady Truelove columns if Clara agrees to a sham courtship.

Rexs intentions aren't wholly altruistic: his need to find a wife, or show actual intention of the hunt is what he believes he needs to regain the allowance from his father. In addition, he sees the confident, assured and intelligence Clara misses in herself, and finds her lack of confidence frustrating. Slowly as they spend time, and with his knowledge that his interest in Clara (false or not) will increase the interest in her by other men in society  thus increasing her chances of obtaining her dream of marriage and children. But what Rex never quite intended, even as he wants Clara, is that he could find himself jealous of others or missing her company.

Easy reading: light and fun with great dialogue, easy banter and a level of tension between Rex and Clara that is measurable: the real star in this story is Rexs gentle coaxing of Claras confidence and awareness of herself in both business and personal dealings. Hes sweet even when he tries not to be, honorable when she doubts it, and totally in love even as neither recognize it.  A lovely story that left me wanting more  and I can hope for more with a story about Clara and Irenes errant brother James.

6430,159,385,"With historical fiction it's so hard to find an angle that doesn't feel somewhat overdone, especially when it comes to WWII.  While I would continue enjoying historical fiction regardless of how many novels I read with similar storylines, it's great to find something fresh and different. The Women in the Castle is unlike any other historical fiction novel I've read before, giving me a new perspective (or three!) from which to view this heartbreaking time in history.

 Most WWII fiction I've read has been from the point of view of the Allies. This is the first novel that I can think of that I've read from the point of view of German women and resisters from varying backgrounds.  Marianne is the rich, strong-willed wife of a murdered resistance fighter who keeps true to everything they always believed in no matter what she has to face. Benita, a girl from humble beginnings who dreamed of and succeeded in marrying a rich, charming man and living a life of luxury, ends up sacrificing so much of herself, not only to survive but in her attempts to try and forget the past and grasp on to any shred of happiness she can find. Ania, the most pragmatic of the women, will do anything to protect her sons and give them the chance at a better life than they were born into, even if that means keeping secrets and lying to those she cares about. Through the heads, hearts, and eyes of each of these women we get the chance to see a wider range of German people - from resisters to collaborators, those with power and influence to those who have nothing - and it was heartbreaking to see these women stuck in the middle of a brutal and unforgiving world that they had no part in building.

 I was also impressed with how well the author brought this horrible world to life. The descriptions of the bombed out villages and smoldering remains, the starving and/or bitter people trying to survive, even the happy, more prosperous moments that perfectly contrasted with the rest all did their part to drive home this singular time in history and the good and the bad that came out of it.

 On top of all this the author included a great author's note and P.S. section that explains the origins of the story as well as an additional chapter not included in the hardcover version that better fills in a part of Ania's backstory, centered around the bombing of Dresden. These extra goodies are always the  icing on the cake, especially with a story such as this that is so easy to get emotionally invested in.

The Women in the Castle has already made it onto my ""best of"" list for 2018! It's historical fiction at it's finest, shining light on a new (for me) angle of history that not only entertains but teaches us something as well. It's about the guilt of a nation and of individuals and the complicated battle between what can be deemed as forgivable, understandable, and forever contemptible. If you enjoy historical fiction make sure to put this one on your TBR pile!",1517356800,5

This book is a great introduction.",1517356800,5
6432,344,1700,"I was going to write this novel off at first because, I thought the author was going to push an agenda. That was until I read the back in full and realized it's about a grave issue, not a dangerous ideology. On that note, the author uses a mix of characters, writing style, and (maybe) facts to drive how what could turn into a future reality.

First off, the characters have their own set of struggles and personalities, which made them seem quite real. However, them being likable is a different matter because, May-Ling was annoying at times. (Please keep in mind that I withheld this judgment for a while.) Still, I thought she was courageous for admitting she could be unlovable because, I've learned that's easier to blame others then move on.

On the plus side, I thought Wei-guo was quite admirable because, he fought so hard to marry May-Ling. That's understandable because, at this point, she's his last chance. In addition, he avenges his fallen comrades towards the tail end. (That was so exhilarating to read!)

Furthermore, I couldn't help growing attached to Xiong-xin (XX) after it's shown why he wants a divorce. It helped that he didn't abandon MaMa Dog due to her injuries because, I found out from a comment somewhere that most of those people abandon their sick pets. (Please keep in mind that the poster's from there and they were struggling to find vet care at the time.) That and he started to take control towards the end.

On the other hand, I found the writing style to be lacking. The first issue was the issue of the silly words. What makes this irritating is the fact that even with the few sweet moments, this is a serious novel through-and-through. In addition, I thought the author should'n't have used usurp at one because, the last time I checked, that refers to using underhanded methods. I didn't think being gentle (for the most part) counted. That and XX feels like he wasn't being treated like an adult by Hann at times.

That said, the bigger issue was the dog training methods mentioned. It seemed those came off from people who treat dogs like wolves while overlooking key differences and proving they misunderstand both species. (Who else would push for continual domination?) Never mind that dogs are protective of us (for the most part). Wolves, on the other hand, don't. That and dog packs are more open to changing members. Wolf packs aren't, aside from rare cases, because, they're family units. To make matters worse, I read the term pack leader got the impression that the author bingewatched The Dog Whisperer and thought he's a genius. I say that because, I've read countless articles about dog trainer and only seen a small amount of people use that term.

On the other hand, there were a few things I don't mind. The first aspect is the copulation scenes. As much as I didn't enjoy them, I at least thought they were written in a mature fashion. They were also far and few between, which helped emphasize how much both parties disliked it.

In addition, I'm not sure about Lost Boys and the Willfully Sterile, despite research. However, I think it's best to believe the author on this one because, some parts got so horrible, I doubted that it could be made up.

Furthermore, I liked the ending at first because, two of the main characters got married. Also, there might be room for a sequel. (Of course, this might be wishful thinking on my part.) However, I started to reconsider my feelings due to disheartening it was to read.",1517356800,2

6434,396,1799,"Surrender to the Highlander is the second historical romance I have read by Lynsay Sands and I loved it! This book was absolutely amazing in every way. First off, I really loved the premise of this book. The whole situation with Niels and his brothers going to check on Edith at their sister's behest and discovering that someone had been trying to kill her by poisoning made the story quite thrilling and made for a great backdrop for the romance in this story. I loved that Edith and Niels fall in love as they tried to deduce who was trying to kill her. Obviously, it wasn't an ideal situation for these two characters, but it really worked for me as a reader. All the craziness and chaos caused by the threat on Edith's life and mystery surrounding it paired with the sweet romance that the author created between the two made this a book I didn't want to put down. Overall, this book was a spectacular historical romance and I really recommend it!",1517356800,5
6435,506,1756,"This was an excellent mystery whose only flaw was the cliffhanger ending. I want books two and three RIGHT NOW.

Stevie Bell has been accepted at the Ellingham Academy in rural Vermont. The school was founded by a tycoon in the 1930s to provide a free education to students from a wide variety of backgrounds and with a wide variety of interests. Her housemates include and inventor, a novelist, an eccentric artist, an actor, and a character steeped in mystery. Stevie wants to solve mysteries and the one most on her mind is the kidnapping and disappearance of the school founder's wife and daughter in 1936. While the wife's body was found, the child's was not.

Stevie has read all the books about the mystery. She has gathered thousands of pages of research including court transcripts, FBI interviews, and newspaper clippings. She is glad to be at the school and away from the parents who don't understand her and who support a political candidate she can't stand.

The curriculum caters to her interests and she is kept busy with schoolwork and the day to day activities of a boarding school. Stevie is worried about the usual things: fitting in and making friends. Stevie also suffers from anxiety and takes medication to combat panic attacks. These things all fit in around her research.

When Hayes, the actor, comes to her and asks for her help recreating the kidnapping, she pulls in Nate to do the writing while she provides the technical details. They gather together with other friends to produce a video. But then Hayes dies in one of the tunnels that riddle the school. Was it a tragic accident? Or is there a new murderer stalking Ellingham Academy?

I loved the writing in this book. The story was descriptive, lyrical, and often sort of creepy. Stevie is a great character who sometimes gets so focused on crime solving that she neglects the people in her life. David was a fascinating character who provides quite a puzzle to Stevie even as they begin a tentative romance.

Fans of mysteries, boarding schools, and romance will all enjoy this story and be eager to find out more when books two and three are available.",1517356800,5
6436,162,1799,">>>>> My Synopsis (Review follows): <<<<<
When Saidh MacDonnell hasn't heard from her good friend Edith in weeks, she asks her husband to have someone check on her. The last she'd heard Edith had been feeling poorly and Saidh fears the worst. Given that Saidh is four months pregnant and as big as a house, and the last messenger sent was refused entry, her husband complies. He asks Saidh's four brothers to go check on Edith. What Niels, Rory, Alick, and Geordie find is not what they expected. Illness is not the culprit as everyone assumed. Someone has poisoned the Drummond clan leaving the Laird and his two eldest sons dead. The youngest son, thinking to escape the same fate, fled with his bride and hasn't been heard from since. Edith is holding on by a thread, and Neils and Rory vow they'll do all they can to nurse her back to health and make sure she comes to no more harm.

A killer is out there.

An attraction blooms.

Can Edith resist the affections of the handsome Highlander with twinkling blue eyes who seems bent on saving her? Only time will tell...

>>>>> My Review: <<<<<
This is the fifth book of Lysay Sands Highlander series and can be read as standalone. You may, however, wish to read 'The Highlander Takes a Bride', the third book in the Highlanders series which is Saidh's book, first. It will give you a little insight into Neils and his family along with a glimpse of the friendship between Saidh and Edith.

I really liked the mystery and whodunnit aspect of the book. I had it narrowed down to two people when the author killed off one of my suspects. It, of course, had to be the one I was leaning towards. I couldn't puzzle out the motive of the one left, however, so I thought perhaps I had it wrong until the author let the last puzzle piece fall conveniently into place. Then it all made sense.

Niels was a loyal and caring individual. He had to be talked in to checking on Edith, but once he found foul play involved, he was all in and fiercely protective. I liked how he and his brothers watched over Edith until she could take care of herself, and then didn't abandon her. They waited until the danger had passed before letting down their guard.

Edith was a smart and strong female who only broke down once in the novel. She went through a lot and instead of becoming a blubbering idiot she stayed on her toes and did what she could to help. She kept her head and put up a good defense when confronted with danger. While I liked this aspect of her, I felt she should have been at least a little more upset about her family's demise than she was. A few ""I can't believe they're gone"" type of moments seemed to be called for. Her lack of emotions where they were concerned just seemed a little off.

Niels and Edith were a cute couple. I loved how Niels felt he wasn't worthy of Edith because he was a third son and didn't have a lot to offer her. He was quite noble and tried to resist his feelings for her while she did everything in her power to tempt him. The courtship of these two gave me a good chuckle.

Overall, I liked the book and gave it 4 out of 5 roses. It showcased Ms. Sand's quirky sense of humor and lovable characters. It was fairly fast paced, and had a nice mixture of gravity and levity, romance and mystery, and darkness and light. On the Lisarenee Romance Rating Scale, this one earned a STEAM rating--too hot for a fan, but you still have a handle on things. You should use extreme caution when reading a book with this rating in public. People may inquire as to why you looked flustered and flushed.",1517356800,4

It was definitely a very powerful read and, as someone who has lost a lot of weight, a subject very near and dear to my heart. Her struggles with why she gained weight (she was gang raped at age 12) and the subsequent invisibility and abuse she has endured due to her large/fat body (what she calls it throughout the book) is insightful. She talks openly and candidly about how others see her, how she sees herself and her past and current struggles. Theres a lot I related to, even though I am no longer fat or large and was never anywhere near her size. The thing I took away from it was to be kinder to strangers. Even more impactful, though, was what she said about fiction and life in general: It is all about the pursuit of desire And so the ways in which she talks about hunger (both for food and for other, etherial things) was beautiful.",1517356800,5

6440,711,1510,"Alafair Burke brings us her 12th solo novel on the heels of her Edgar-nominated THE EX. As relevant as todays headlines, THE WIFE portrays in spellbinding suspense a story that peels away the layers of the complex characters involved in a sexual scandal, and keeps the pages turning to its shattering climax.

Angela had built a successful career as a caterer in the posh New York town of East Hampton, where she first met Jason Powell, a brilliant economics professor at NYU. They married after a whirlwind romance, which allowed Angela and her small son to move from her mothers humble home and the scene of her tragic past, to Manhattan to create a new life under a new name.

The first six years of their marriage were idyllic. They built a comfortable life with a good school for their son, whom Jason claimed as his own but never officially adopted. Angela gains a loyal following at Manhattan soirees for her catering skills, which she applies at her leisure. But when Jason writes a bestseller on economics and becomes the darling of talk shows, making frequent guest shots on cable morning news programs, their lives take a dramatic turn with his celebrity. Angela becomes concerned that her bubble of anonymity will burst. Will she be recognized by ghosts from her past?

A college intern in Jasons firm publicly accuses him of exposing himself and trying to seduce her, which makes headlines because of his prominence. Angela rejects the allegations as do his business partners and friends. Even after a high-profile businesswoman, Kerry Lynch, accuses him of a much more grievous sexual assault soon after the allegations from the intern surface, Angela remains loyal. She continues to stick by Jason, but the media latches onto the story.

Angelas photo appears in the press at public events with Jason, bringing unwanted publicity to Angela in the cocoon she has created for herself and her son. She worries that her quiet life and the cover she has so carefully constructed are in jeopardy of being blown. Shy by nature, her greatest fear is that if these accusations end up in court, she may have to take the stand to defend her husband, further exposing her family to her hidden past.

If there is a gene marker for writing, then Alafair Burke most certainly inherited her skills at creating engrossing, page-turning, even skin-crawling suspense from her father, James Lee Burke. Burke fans first meet the fictional Alafair as a wee child, rescued from a plane crash in book one of the long-running hit series featuring Dave Robicheaux. Her continuing presence in Burkes bestselling detective novels makes one feel akin to the real Alafair, who grew up to become an attorney and a New York City prosecutor. She now teaches law, and lives and writes in Manhattan.

Publication Date: January 30, 2018
Genre: Historical Romance
Reviewed by: Reading in Pajamas/ Cori
Rated 4.5 Stars

When Lynsay Sands releases a book I immediately grab a copy because I know Im going to enjoy it. Her historical and paranormal romance series are a great mix of humor and hot romance. SURRENDER TO THE HIGHLANDER is the fifth book in Lynsay Sands' Scottish Highlander Series, but each book is a standalone and you do not need to read the previous before picking up this one. I highly recommend the entire series though and the characters are connected. SURRENDER TO THE HIGHLANDER is Neil Buchanan and Ediths story and they were introduced in previous books. Neil is one of Siadhs many brothers and Edith is one of her close friends. Their story had a mystery, some humor and some steamy romance. I highly recommend this series for historical romance lovers looking for hot Scottish romances. Theyre addicting!

6443,282,1778,"After devouring Holiday Wishes and Chasing Christmas Eve this past fall, About That Kiss was incredibly high on my January 2018 wish list. I couldn't wait to see what romance would swoop through Heartbreaker Bay next.
WHAT I LIKED:

1. The Characters - I loved Kylie and Joe in the past books so I was beyond excited to have an entire book focused on them. Kylie is sweet, lovable, and incredibly loyal - she's someone you'd want on your side for sure! I also appreciated that she was by no means a pushover. She knew what she wanted, and she'd do anything to achieve it. Joe, on the other hand, is aloof and headstrong. He's used to doing things his way; however, Kylie knocks him on his feet in that regard. I loved seeing Joe's sweeter side come out as the book progressed. He was quite the sweetheart deep down, and I admired his dedication in helping Kylie find her lost penguin.

2. The Romance - The romance starts with a hot, steamy kiss in a back alley and then fizzles into a mess of mixed signals and complicated feelings....and I LOVED seeing Joe and Kylie bounce back from that. It was easy to tell that they were perfect for each other. The only problem? They were too stubborn to admit it. I loved the banter between the two as well as the chemistry. It was always fun to see Kylie refuse to take the lead on the investigation - she insisted on being part too!

3. The Mystery - About That Kiss features a mystery, and as an avid mystery lover, I was super excited about that aspect. In the beginning of the book, Kylie has one of her most prized possessions (a wooden penguin from her late grandfather) stolen from her, and while some may think a wooden penguin would be a silly thing to be upset about, Kylie is determined to get it back even if it means recruiting Joe for help. At first, I thought the mystery would be easy to solve. How many people would want a wooden penguin? However, I was wrong. Joe and Kylie go on an exciting hunt to find it, and given the surplus of quirky suspects and mysterious, threatening letters, it was a ton of fun to read about!

4. The Family - Just like with Jill Shalvis's past books, About That Kiss has a strong family feel. I loved learning more about Joe's family life, and I especially loved seeing him interact with his father and sister. Those two definitely kept Joe on his toes! I also enjoyed seeing Kylie become part of the family as well. Kylie, on the other hand, has always had a complicated family life: her grandfather raised her while her mother did her own thing. It's incredibly easy to see how much Kylie loved her grandfather, and my heart broke that she felt guilt over his sudden death. I just wanted to give her a hug! I also liked how Kylie began to mend fences with her mother over the course of the book.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:

1. The Pacing - It took me a while to get fully invested in About That Kiss because of the pacing. It started off slightly slow and took a while to build up. Not the biggest problem overall; however, I wish there had been a tad bit more zazz in the beginning.

The overall result? Just as swoony and charming as its predecessors, About That Kiss is yet another must read from Jill Shalvis!",1517356800,4
6444,1092,1403,"I found this book based on the recommendation of others, and it is wonderful. This is a YA novel set in Detroit about a young Haitian girl who moves to the U.S. but is separated from her mother and living with new cousins. The book was beautifully written and read quite well, so I enjoyed it. The immigrant story is well done and, as Fabiola struggles to figure out her new American life, find a way to reunite with her mother, and understand what it means to pursue the American dream, I can feel her pain and her hope. I think my favorite part was some of the magical realism in the book, which is not usually something I go for. All in all, though, the new world presented in this is exciting and definitely a story many of us can relate to.",1517356800,5

Stars (Out of 10): 6/10 Stars

Overall Thoughts: While I definitely enjoyed this installment, I liked it far less than the first book. Some of the plot, while overall interesting, seemed a bit dull or boring, and I sometimes found myself reading just to get back to the interesting parts, not because I enjoyed what I was currently reading. However, the ending took me for a spin, and I do where the plot brought us in the end. (I am also extremely extremely glad that I finished this a few days before the finale because I definitely could not handle waiting any longer.)

The Good: I quite enjoyed the plot, especially the ending. In addition, I liked the introduction of many new side characters, and exploring ideas from the first book more. Also, since they are no longer in the Silver Kingdom, we see more of the other side of society.

The Bad: Some parts of the book fell a bit flat, or boring. In addition, actions/thoughts of both Mare and those around her gave Mare the idea of being a very unlikable person, with very little redeeming qualities. She almost reminded me of Katniss, sometimes acting selfish, or at odds with the people around her, and pushing away people for seemingly no reason. This made it a bit less enjoyable, since it seemed many bonds built over years were somewhat broken, and reasons were given by Mare herself to distrust almost everyone, and reasons for them to dislike her.

SPOILERS BEGIN HERE

The Characters: As I said above, while I enjoyed the new side characters, and additions they made to our current ones, I hate what they took away from Mare. She became unlikable, isolated, and sometimes cruel, and while I understand how her character got there, and the reality of the situation, it made the book, at points, less interesting to read. Instead of a strong group banded together, it usually seemed more of a group of people who would rather be far away from each other, feeling forced to work together. I also felt it sometimes took away from the interesting plot going on, as division and relationship issues battled for the forefront of readers attention. However, I do quite enjoy the direction Mare is now taking, and the growth seen in the last few chapters as Mare attempts to fix her isolation (up until she gets kinda sorta captured by Maven, and kinda sorta is scheduled for execution.)

The Plot: I actually really enjoyed where the plot went in this novel. I do like that the rebel groups were unwilling to trust a silver and someone with the powers of one, because it felt truly realistic. I also liked how this forced them to go on their own, as if the rebels could be easily swayed by a few silver words, it would undermine the strength of both the leader and the organization. However, I truly enjoyed the final parts of the book, from the heist to Mare taking more of a leadership role and coming up with her own plan. And lastly, Im sure that cliffhanger will continue to haunt me until I get my hands on Kings Cage! (Which will, if Amazon doesnt fall me, be tomorrow, the 7th!)

The World Building: I actually really enjoyed how the author switched perspectives to give a better view of the world. Instead of kings and queens, we saw the poor and the rebels. Instead of sparkling clean, cities, we saw the slums, the reason these people are fighting. It both strengthens the rebels cause, and allows us to see the true secrets of the world this novel takes place in.

The Favorite Character: The poor heartbroken Cal (although, by the end, anyone can fit that title ); )

6446,436,958,"Title: Far From The Tree

Author: Robin Benway

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Contemporary Fiction

Series: Standalone

Star Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

Robin Benway came into my life when I received a copy of Also Known As, the first book in her contemporary romantic spy series, as an advanced readers copy. I found Far From The Tree as I usually find books in my library stack, a recommendation. I finally got to it after I finished reading All Rights Reserved Saturday night. I was immediately drawn into the world of Grace, Maya, and Joaquin, and their journey to find each other, themselves, and the many meanings of family. Far From The Tree is a tender, heartbreaking and utterly compassionate novel, and I loved every moment of it, even as it gutted me entirely. One of the best books of 2017, hands down, and the National Book Award Finalist is well-deserved! I cant wait to see what else Benway has in store!

Grace, Maya, and Joaquin are three different people from varying backgrounds; they are also all adopted. When Grace gets pregnant by accident, she makes the difficult decision to put her baby up for adoption. Bereft and untethered after giving birth, she reaches out to try and find the blood family she never knew, starting with her mother. She, Maya, a hard-as-nails, dark-humored lesbian, and Joaquin, the boy whose quiet nature hides scars of every kind, all meet and gradually begin to connect. They forge a strong bond, even though theyve only known each other for a short time, and eventually begin the search for the one person theyve all been searching for: their birth mother.

I really, really loved this loved this book; its easily one of my favorite books of 2017. Normally, my tastes run more toward fantasy novels, but Ive been loving contemporary for a long time. So when Far From The Tree caught my eye with its pretty cover and the glowing reviews Id read previously, I was really excited. The prose was beautiful and magnetic, and I was immediately drawn into the world of these three young people. I loved the plot, especially when it came to discussing the topic of adoption, and Benway uses compassion, tenderness, and empathy when she talks about it. But even more than those things, I loved the main characters, all of them with distinct personalities, flaws, and struggles. Grace, the young mother who is struggling with giving her baby away, Maya, whose family is falling apart at the seams and being torn apart by dark secrets, and Joaquin, the boy so used to abandonment hes afraid to get close to anyone. This book; it made me laugh, cry, scream, and cheer, and its one of my favorites of the yearI will never forget this loving book that showed me that family and love can come in all kinds of different forms! The bottom line: A beautifully written, tender and funny book full of humor, heart, and compassion, I loved Far From The Tree! Next on deck: Given to the Earth by Mindy McGinnis!",1517356800,5
6447,710,854,"I love family sagas, and Adriana Trigiani is a master at them. Kiss Carlo is a story of family, romance, loyalty, trust, dreams, and tradition. It opens in May 1949 in South Philly after the men have returned from war. Dom and Mike Palazzini, brothers in an Italian-American family have not spoken for an estimated 16 years.

Nicky Castone, orphaned at a young age, has lived with his uncle Dom and aunt Jo since he was five years old. He drives a taxi for the family cab company and delivers telegrams for Hortense Mooney. He has been engaged to Peachy for seven years. Nicky has never told Peachy about his evening job with a small Shakespeare theatre company run by Calla Borelli. One night when he has to fill in for an absent actor he finds himself bitten by the acting bug. Working with the determined and passionate Calla, Nicky finally realizes that something is missing in his life. He recognizes that he does not want to marry Peachy.

Nicky struggles to find his place in the world as he flees to Roseto, Pennsylvania while impersonating an Italian ambassador. This then leads him to the hillside village of Roseto Valfortore in Italy. Upon his return to the US, he announces to his family that he is moving to New York City to pursue an acting career.

It took me a while to grasp who all characters were as all of Dom and Jos sons and their wives and children still live with them. The characters are beautifully brought to life, revealing their strengths, their flaws, their backstories.

6448,157,191,I devoured this book. Could not put it down. I was completely fascinated by its religious overtones. This is a very worthwhile book to read.,1517443200,5
6449,82,248,"When it comes to reading there are very few things my father and I have in common given that the number of books he's read for pleasure in his life can be counted on the hand of someone who's been mangled in an industrial accident. As a practical person, deciphering the relational structures of postmodernist novels wasn't exactly high on his list of life goals. Somehow despite this he managed to not screw up raising me and my siblings (although my mother might argue she gets some credit).

But the one thing he did have on me from a literary standpoint was that he's read this novel, albeit in high school as part of an assignment. But he actually read it and I remember as a kid him talking about liking it, which coming from someone for whom ""Ulysses"" might be a doorstop or something you smash a fly with, it made an impression on me.

My class read ""Great Expectations"" in high school and I read ""Bleak House"" a few years back on my own (sadly, because of the spontaneous combustion scene, despite it being like five pages in a super long novel) but getting to this one took me a while longer. This one is probably more of an acknowledged classic, or at least the one people can name after the one with Ebenezer Mickey, with probably even more people able to quote the opening and closing lines, despite sometimes probably not knowing where its originates.

With my previous experiences with Dickens giving me cause to batten down the hatches and prepare for a dense go, I was mildly surprised to find this one reads relatively quickly and unlike the ""oh God make a flow chart or you're doomed"" that was the power-packed cross-sectional experience of ""Bleak House"" this one was refreshingly straightforward. If not for the fact that it was written for people born a hundred and twenty years before I was it would have qualified as an easy read.

The premise itself surprisingly isn't as straightforward and those who associate the book with wall to wall guillotines might find it takes as head before the head loppings start to occur. In typical Dickens fashion we're introduced to characters who come from mysterious circumstances that won't be detailed until it becomes important later in the plot, in this case the reemergence of Dr Manette into the world after having been imprisoned in France for a good eighteen years. He takes a while to adjust to being back in the real world but once he does he moves in with his daughter in England and goes about his life more or less normally except for those moments when he's stressed and goes all Jimmy Choo with the desire to do nothing but make fabulous shoes.

Into this mix is the aforementioned daughter Lucie, who being young and pretty has but one speed in her transmission and that's ""good"". Being a young and pretty girl in a Dickens novel (and I suppose like real life) she has a number of suitors, one of whom, Charles Darnay, has recently been found innocent of spying thanks to the quick work of his attorney. And while that cozy domesticity goes on, things are starting to get ugly in France. With discontent rumbling between the nobility and the lower classes its becomes very clear very quickly that something has got to give and when it does give its not going to be pretty.

Of the three Dickens novels I've read, this was the one where I could feel the heavy hand of the author laying down the strands of the plot as I reading it. Maybe I'm more trained to look for this stuff now thanks to hearing all my English teachers' voices in my head (like those movies where the hero receives aid from the spirits of his ancestors, only mine whisper ""look for didactic metaphors and use of color"") or with the plot is relentlessly efficient but Dickens' tendency to start threads and ruthlessly tie them up is on overdrive here. If you're a canny reader you can pretty much figure out that every seemingly extraneous detail is going to importantly figure into the plot at some point. Whether its a random scene of graverobbing or the French peasants visiting the doctor's former cell or an lady's borderline irrational hatred or even someone remarking early on that a guy looks just like another guy . . . if its important enough to be made note of you can bet your sweet bippy that you're going to be hearing about it again just when you least expect it. Maybe because the novel is so short there were less other moments surrounding that stuff to keep it from standing out (unlike ""Bleak House"" where the book was so dense that the subplots were capable of standing on their own as separate novels) or maybe Dickens wanted to show off his plotting prowess to the masses. It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the book, it was just interesting to note. Or maybe I'm getting better at reading literary classics.

And while you can perhaps criticize the characters as a means to get the plot where it needs to go (other than maybe Sydney Carton, there isn't much in the way of character development . . . unless they die, people pretty much end the book as the same people who started it) all that can be forgiven when the Reign of Terror finally kicks in maybe about halfway through. What was previously a simmering fire of resentment erupts into a surprisingly bloodthirsty orgy of violence and Dickens goes out of this way to layer lurid scene after lurid scene of people essentially losing their minds and giving in to a sort of organized anarchy where everyone has reason to be afraid (unless you follow the rules but the rules keep changing) and when the heads start hitting the block there's no telling when the guillotine blade may call for thee. I don't know how historically accurate the book is (being the French revolution was about sixty years prior, I don't know how much firsthand research Dickens bothered to do) but he sure conveys what you imagine it would be like as the working masses take over and proceed to make any aristocrat or anyone who vaguely smells of aristocrat about a head shorter (officially about 2600 died in Paris alone so its not like they got a couple and said, oh that's enough). Beyond the Defarges, Dickens treats most of the French as one giant pack of baying hounds, to the point where everyone literally seems to be named Jacques (beyond one other character intriguingly called ""The Vengeance"", which I imagine is a cross between the Punisher and Batroc the Leaper).

This is where the book gains momentum and where all the careful laying down of threads in the early stages starts to pay off as the revelations come fast and furious. A main character is arrested, everyone goes to rescue him while doing their best not to get themselves arrested, he gets released and is arrested again. Friends deal with spies, desperate plans are hatched, people suddenly have brothers, an old lady keeps knitting and in true Dickens style everyone starts to get what they deserve, for better or for worse. Its the sacrifice one character makes toward the end that really gives the book its sense of tragedy and this is where Dickens' plotting works wonders because his skill simultaneously gives the decision a spur of the moment feel and an inevitable culmination of a series of events going back to the beginning of the story. In a way he's a prisoner of fate but even if he understands that he goes willingly and in his demise makes his mark perhaps more than any of the other characters do by staying alive. For when its all over they might step back into their lives, but by dying he does something better . . . he steps into eternity.",1517443200,5

I put off reading this book for a long time because I thought it was just about some jerk girl that was killing dragons. I don't do killing dragons books. Unless it's just some random thing in the book.

But..

THIS. IS. NOT. THAT. BOOK.

EXCERPT*

  In the beginning, there was the Namsara: the child of the sky and spirit, who carried love and laughter wherever he went. But where there is light, there must be darkness-and so there was also the Iskari. The child of blood and moonlight. The destroyer. The death bringer.

END EXCERPT*

Asha is the Iskari in the book. She tells stories to lure the dragons out. The stories are against the law. She follows the Old One. Someone is coming to her in her thoughts and dreams. She kills dragons. She thought she had a reason. She was wrong.

Let me first say that I LOVE:
Asha - Iskari
Torwin - love interest - slave
Safire - Cousin
Dax - Brother
Elorma - Namsara
Kozu - Dragon
Shadow - Dragon

There are a few others that play parts that are awesome too.

Asha is supposed to marry, Jarek. He's a jerk that is the commandant to the king. The King is Asha's father. He's a jerk. Jarek is a jerk. I wanted them dead from the moment I met them. Then the more evil things I found out the more I wanted to kill them myself.

Safire is Asha's cousin. She's fierce and she trains with Asha. Safire is her own force to be reckoned with and she is Asha's dearest friend as well.

Torwin is a slave to Jarek. I love Torwin so much. Torwin is treated badly by the jerk, Jarek!. And Asha and Torwin slowly become interested in each other. I mean it's so slow I thought I was going to ooze out into the floor with the tension. All of you insta-love haters will love that.

Asha's father tells her if she goes and kills the first dragon, Kozu, that he will call off her wedding to Jarek. Asha is all for this because Kozu is the dragon that burned her when she was young.

BUT

Things are not what they seem and Asha finds out things that are horrific. Things about her father, things that happened to her as a child. Why her mother died. Why her brother Dax is slowly dying. Why she will become the best of what she truly is with the help of her family and friends and her love.

There is a part. Well there are many parts, that I wanted Jarek dead. But this was the last straw and he became nothing.

EXCERPT*

  ""I'm going to kill him.""
  Safire dragged Asha out of the pool of dragon blood and brought her to the lake edge, trying to wash it from her knees and legs.
  ""I'm going to gut him with my bare hands and use his entrails for dragon bait.""

END EXCERPT*

But at least there was a happy ending! But we shall see what happens in the next book!

Happy Reading!

How do we know what that is, in general?
Naturalism and darwinism exclude actually such categories. Allegedly, these are the incidental products of biological processes, ""unscientific"" fantasies, which should be eliminated.
On the other hand, there are also some wrong things in the book.
However, I will not write about it here.
Even the best people make mistakes (I'm not an exception, of course).

6452,199,1617,"I'd be interested to know where Mayne stands on religion, since both his first and this Jessica Blackwood books have religious overtones. The first book featured a villain who thought he was a god. This book's plot was all about the Pope--was he a good guy, or did he take part in the murder of a child years ago? Blackwood uses both FBI intelligence and gadgets and her own insight from her background as a magician to darw conclusions about who/why/where/when. Intriguing. Blackwood is complex enough to make her an empathetic character. I find myself pulling for her and wanting good things for her. She's so good at what she does, however, that those around her often get their noses bent out of shape and she has to deal with their egos and their jealousy.

6453,181,1420,"If you read the summary, youve read the book.

I had a lot of issues with this book, so instead of reviewing it in paragraphs, Im going to do bullet points.

The pacing was all wrong.
30% in and we finally end a chase scene that incites the actual plot, and honestly it could have been two or three chapters instead of eleven.
So many POVS and a lot were introduced late into the story.
The action is superficial and barely there.
This book has no reason to be 500+ pages long.
The pacing, again, is a huge problem. They story never felt fully there.
Boring, boring, bored.
Lots of cliches.
Telling, no showing.
Weird romance kind of and it just was bleh.
Overall, a lot going wrong and not enough story to push it through.
This story was superficial, generic, and all around not great. Not awful, but definitely not something I would read again, or even continue reading.",1517443200,2
6454,82,246,"When it comes to reading there are very few things my father and I have in common given that the number of books he's read for pleasure in his life can be counted on the hand of someone who's been mangled in an industrial accident. As a practical person, deciphering the relational structures of postmodernist novels wasn't exactly high on his list of life goals. Somehow despite this he managed to not screw up raising me and my siblings (although my mother might argue she gets some credit).

But the one thing he did have on me from a literary standpoint was that he's read this novel, albeit in high school as part of an assignment. But he actually read it and I remember as a kid him talking about liking it, which coming from someone for whom ""Ulysses"" might be a doorstop or something you smash a fly with, it made an impression on me.

My class read ""Great Expectations"" in high school and I read ""Bleak House"" a few years back on my own (sadly, because of the spontaneous combustion scene, despite it being like five pages in a super long novel) but getting to this one took me a while longer. This one is probably more of an acknowledged classic, or at least the one people can name after the one with Ebenezer Mickey, with probably even more people able to quote the opening and closing lines, despite sometimes probably not knowing where its originates.

With my previous experiences with Dickens giving me cause to batten down the hatches and prepare for a dense go, I was mildly surprised to find this one reads relatively quickly and unlike the ""oh God make a flow chart or you're doomed"" that was the power-packed cross-sectional experience of ""Bleak House"" this one was refreshingly straightforward. If not for the fact that it was written for people born a hundred and twenty years before I was it would have qualified as an easy read.

The premise itself surprisingly isn't as straightforward and those who associate the book with wall to wall guillotines might find it takes as head before the head loppings start to occur. In typical Dickens fashion we're introduced to characters who come from mysterious circumstances that won't be detailed until it becomes important later in the plot, in this case the reemergence of Dr Manette into the world after having been imprisoned in France for a good eighteen years. He takes a while to adjust to being back in the real world but once he does he moves in with his daughter in England and goes about his life more or less normally except for those moments when he's stressed and goes all Jimmy Choo with the desire to do nothing but make fabulous shoes.

Into this mix is the aforementioned daughter Lucie, who being young and pretty has but one speed in her transmission and that's ""good"". Being a young and pretty girl in a Dickens novel (and I suppose like real life) she has a number of suitors, one of whom, Charles Darnay, has recently been found innocent of spying thanks to the quick work of his attorney. And while that cozy domesticity goes on, things are starting to get ugly in France. With discontent rumbling between the nobility and the lower classes its becomes very clear very quickly that something has got to give and when it does give its not going to be pretty.

Of the three Dickens novels I've read, this was the one where I could feel the heavy hand of the author laying down the strands of the plot as I reading it. Maybe I'm more trained to look for this stuff now thanks to hearing all my English teachers' voices in my head (like those movies where the hero receives aid from the spirits of his ancestors, only mine whisper ""look for didactic metaphors and use of color"") or with the plot is relentlessly efficient but Dickens' tendency to start threads and ruthlessly tie them up is on overdrive here. If you're a canny reader you can pretty much figure out that every seemingly extraneous detail is going to importantly figure into the plot at some point. Whether its a random scene of graverobbing or the French peasants visiting the doctor's former cell or an lady's borderline irrational hatred or even someone remarking early on that a guy looks just like another guy . . . if its important enough to be made note of you can bet your sweet bippy that you're going to be hearing about it again just when you least expect it. Maybe because the novel is so short there were less other moments surrounding that stuff to keep it from standing out (unlike ""Bleak House"" where the book was so dense that the subplots were capable of standing on their own as separate novels) or maybe Dickens wanted to show off his plotting prowess to the masses. It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the book, it was just interesting to note. Or maybe I'm getting better at reading literary classics.

And while you can perhaps criticize the characters as a means to get the plot where it needs to go (other than maybe Sydney Carton, there isn't much in the way of character development . . . unless they die, people pretty much end the book as the same people who started it) all that can be forgiven when the Reign of Terror finally kicks in maybe about halfway through. What was previously a simmering fire of resentment erupts into a surprisingly bloodthirsty orgy of violence and Dickens goes out of this way to layer lurid scene after lurid scene of people essentially losing their minds and giving in to a sort of organized anarchy where everyone has reason to be afraid (unless you follow the rules but the rules keep changing) and when the heads start hitting the block there's no telling when the guillotine blade may call for thee. I don't know how historically accurate the book is (being the French revolution was about sixty years prior, I don't know how much firsthand research Dickens bothered to do) but he sure conveys what you imagine it would be like as the working masses take over and proceed to make any aristocrat or anyone who vaguely smells of aristocrat about a head shorter (officially about 2600 died in Paris alone so its not like they got a couple and said, oh that's enough). Beyond the Defarges, Dickens treats most of the French as one giant pack of baying hounds, to the point where everyone literally seems to be named Jacques (beyond one other character intriguingly called ""The Vengeance"", which I imagine is a cross between the Punisher and Batroc the Leaper).

This is where the book gains momentum and where all the careful laying down of threads in the early stages starts to pay off as the revelations come fast and furious. A main character is arrested, everyone goes to rescue him while doing their best not to get themselves arrested, he gets released and is arrested again. Friends deal with spies, desperate plans are hatched, people suddenly have brothers, an old lady keeps knitting and in true Dickens style everyone starts to get what they deserve, for better or for worse. Its the sacrifice one character makes toward the end that really gives the book its sense of tragedy and this is where Dickens' plotting works wonders because his skill simultaneously gives the decision a spur of the moment feel and an inevitable culmination of a series of events going back to the beginning of the story. In a way he's a prisoner of fate but even if he understands that he goes willingly and in his demise makes his mark perhaps more than any of the other characters do by staying alive. For when its all over they might step back into their lives, but by dying he does something better . . . he steps into eternity.",1517443200,5
6455,808,53,"If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would. You see?

From the genre of literary nonsense comes this classic work loved by children and adults alike.

As Alice slips into a dream, she finds herself chasing after a white rabbit with a waist coat and pocket watch. Apparently, he is late for something important. He heads down a rabbit hole, nothing particularly odd about that, but as Alice follows, she falls into a world very different from her own. A world with Cheshire cats, mad-hatters, packs of living playing cards, and an array of characters which will make Alice's head spin as she manoeuvres cautiously through Wonderland.

As children, the Disney movie was always a favourite; our grandparents collected them for us and we never got bored of Alice in Wonderland. There are a number of significant differences between the book and the movie but as things get ""curiouser and curiouser"", I'm not sure that it makes much difference!

I wasn't a big fan of the more recent movie adaptation by Tim Burton despite being first in line to watch it at the movies. It seemed darker somehow and a lot of the fun had disappeared. I'll be sticking to the Disney version.

Back to the book, I love the way Alice retains her faculties through all her bizarre experiences. She presents as an intelligent, somewhat precocious, child who just wants to make it through the day. She spends so much time trying to make sense of the nonsensical that she almost forgets to enjoy the adventure.

All would agree that this is a timeless classic for a bit of fantastical escapism. Personally, I think those who spend time seeking hidden meaning and symbolic parallels with reality are ruining the fun. There should be a collective ""OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"" leaving the rest of us to enjoy this masterpiece without too much philosophising.

P.S. Why is a raven like a writing desk?",1517443200,5

6458,181,1652,"Im always down for a good contemporary novel, and I adore some of Kasie Wests books, so I was excited to read this one.

Wests last book Lucky in Love was not my favorite in any sense. I was bored and just not enjoying it. I had hopes that this one would be different.

But I decided to stop reading Love, Life, and the List at 42%.

My first issue was that I was bored out of my mind while reading it. I didn't connect with Abby, and actually forgot her name at one point. I didn't like the dynamic of the characters and the storyline felt flat.

Then, I had a problem with how repetitive everything was. I felt as if I was reading sentences over and over, just worded slightly different.

I hated Cooper. Like, I couldn't stand him. Abby is completely in love with him, but I was nowhere near convinced. He came off as annoying and dumb, and actually kind of a jerk. Maybe its a good portrayal of a 17 year old boy, but I was not a fan.

I didn't finish this novel because I saw where it was going, and I didn't like it. There was the start of a love triangle where the good guy would get hurt and Abby wouldnt probably never even realize how much she hurt him. And I didn't want to deal with that.

Overall, I think this book just wasn't for me. It may be a while before I pick up another Kasie West book as well.",1517443200,2

It kept me intrigued from beginning to end.  Its very rare for an author to write a story where Im tempted to skip to the last couple chapters to see what happens because I don't want to wait, that I NEED to know whats going on.  But Jenn accomplished this.  I was soooooo very tempted to skip to the end, but I showed restraint and kept reading.  And boy am I glad I did!!  There were plot twists, surprises, and my poor jaw is paying the price from grinding my teeth together trying to figure everything out.

The characters were well developed.  I could relate to them (not the outrageous money lol, but the feelings) and I wanted to jump into the story to hug them at times or throat punch them when things didn't go as I wanted their characters to do.

6463,1077,1819,"The name Mark Twain, along with Hemingway, is the most recognizable name in American Literature for people who read...and even more amazing for people who do not. Twain's life, like Hemingway's, very often eclipsed their literary brilliance, but hopefully their writing genius will out live the myths they left behind.

Mark Twain's ""A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court"" is one of the most imaginative, satirical, political, and brilliant novels that I have ever had the pleasure to read. It's a precursor to Mel Brooks' films, a precursor to many of Woody Allen's brilliant films and amazing screenplays. It's a blueprint for ""1984"" and nearly a century ahead of Gabriel Garcia's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude."" I was so moved by this book on so many levels that it is almost impossible for me to categorize it in any way without diminishing its scope and grandeur.

The transportation of Hank Morgan of the late nineteenth century back to the sixth century is an odyssey like no other and Mr. Twain's ability to draw parallels between the thirteen centuries that separate the two planes of existence is nothing short of pure genius. The writing is sublime, at times reminding me of Joyce, and at other times reminding me of William Faulkner...two men I have no doubt were in some ways influenced by Mr. Twain.

Any student of literature will at some point be introduced to Mark Twain's works, but not necessarily to this book. I would strongly suggest to all students, and book lovers, to read this amazing work for it is as relevant today as the day it was published and as magical as the characters of Merlin and King Arthur which Mr. Twain so wonderfully envisions.

6467,889,1160,"Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.

I have never read anything like this book in my entire life. I laid in bed for over an hour last night upon finishing this book, just tossing and turning and thinking about everything I just consumed. I still don't think I can put my feelings into words, but I can honestly say this book was a cathartic experience for me, and the irony of the word catharsis being a Greek rooted word is not lost on me, because if this book is anything its a modern day Greek tragedy.

The Secret History is told in a unique style, which is a man reminiscing on some significant events that took place in his college life a bit over a year ago. So, we follow a younger version of Richard, who is finally starting his life away from his abusive and poor family in California. He gets accepted into an elite college in Vermont, and moves across the county in hopes of a fresh start.

Upon arriving to the college, Richard is denied entry into an Ancient Greek course, because the professor that teaches it only allows enrollment to his small, handpicked, group of students that seem almost cult-like. Needless to say, Richard becomes utterly obsessed with the five students in this group and the professor, Julian Morrow, himself. And with a turn of good luck, and by solving a Greek problem, Richard is accepted into this exclusive group.

Yet, in the prologue we find out that Richard, and four others from the group, murdered one of the other students who they are supposed to have a very close friendship with. The Secret History is then told in two parts, one being the events that took place leading up to the death of their fellow classmate, and then one part being all the events that take place after he is murdered.

Bunny is the poor soul that is unfortunately murdered by his peers, yet hes a racist bigot and youll be kind of happy hes dead, for the most part. Richard, as stated in all the paragraphs above, is the narrator looking back on the events that took place. Henry is my personal favorite, but perhaps the worst of the bunch. Or maybe the best, Im not really sure, but thats truly the beauty of this story. Twins, Charles and Camilla. Charles is a bad alcoholic and drug user, and Camilla steals most peoples heart and/or affection. And lastly, we have Francis, who owns a country home that is the stage for many events that take place in this book. Oh, and everyone but Richard has money, even though Richard tries his damnedest to keep that a secret.

What we did was terrible, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henrys, too much Greek prose composition  whatever you like.

All the characters are morally grey to just generally horrible people, but you completely ignore it because Donna Tartt weaves this hypnotic spell with her writing, that you feel like you are reading this book in a dream like lull. The Secret History is unlike anything Ive ever read before, and Im not sure Ill ever read anything quite like it again.

I also want to touch upon sexuality in this book, because a lot of the members in this group are not straight in the slightest. Like, maybe the only ones that were completely straight were Bunny and Camilla. Im not saying that LGBTQIAP+ in this book is vilified, but its for sure not shown in the best of lights. So please use caution while going into this.

And this book is so very heavy in general, so please use caution while reading. Content/Trigger warnings for slut shaming, use of the R word, homophobia, hate speech, fatphobic comments, racist comments, animal cruelty, sexual assault, incest, performing rituals, suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, and murder.

I know this review is probably not one of my best, and I know Im being super vague about all these big themes, but this book is just on a whole other level. Maybe this book is about five new adults dealing with the consequences of murder in a very human and realistic way. Maybe its about how we are all just trying to fit in and find family, by whatever unhealthy means available and/or possible. Maybe this book is about birth and death and how important the time between those two points truly is. But I do believe with my whole heart that this book would best be experienced blind, and to just go in and feel all the feelings that Donna Tartt will serve you.

While finishing the book, me and my friend had a discussion about the ending and how Greek heroes tales normally go. We talked about how murder taints everything, and how blood is the only thing that can purify it. We talked about how wearing masks is so important, yet death is another mask that we will all eventually wear. God, Im being so cryptic, but if youve read the book maybe this paragraph will mean something to you, because it means the world to me.

Overall, I know I sound like a broken record, but this was one of the most unique reading experiences of my life. I honest to God just do not have the words to put in this review how this book made me feel. I will say that it very much feels like a spell is being cast upon you while reading. Like, I am almost positive that Donna Tartt cannot be a human being, because she is such an exclusive enigma. Also, I think Ive developed a huge crush on her, so theres that at least. I can say very confidently that I will remember this book, and the feelings it gave me while reading, for the rest of my life.

6468,35,1820,"This is one of the most tedious books I have ever read.  I stayed with it because the subject matter was interesting and the reviews promised an exciting ending.  There are two sub stories in addition to the main story about a Russian ballerina, her life and her defections.  The sub stories added little to the book which in large print was 624 pages long.  The story abut the ballerina was fascinating and could have stood well on its own.  The book simply does not flow smoothly.",1517443200,3
6469,464,1800,"Far more complex and layered with issues, dreams, obstacles than I expected, the emotion of this story took me by the throat and wouldnt let go.  Jack is a cadet, living with his best friends Charlie, Danika and Vodka. See, Jack uses the alcohol and women (oh a parade of women) to escape the voices in his head, the imagery, the guilt and shame.  He also doesnt really want to be a cop, its just something that will provide a paycheck and pension, and help keep his mother safe and away from her former profession.  Jack is one of those arrogant but clever, thoughtful and thoughtless people who shouldnt be so damn attractive  but hes also good looking and surprisingly aware of boundaries (for others) and chivalrous even as he leaves in the middle of the night with no intention of calling ever.

Katie is an Olympic Gold medalist, in New York for two weeks and planning to cram in all the enjoyment and life shed missed  when not there to do her job. A fascination with old mob murders are the start of her introduction to Jack  who keeps her safe, teases and flirts, yet walks away after securing a date to meet at a fountain where she will reenact the opening scene from Friends.  Imagine the surprise when Katie is the instructor for specialized training at the academy  with one cadet to move on to an elite unit.  Surprise, delight, horror, embarrassment and even desire are warring within her: and her determination to remain professional (and not sully her career ) have decided the issue. The flirtation and diversion that Jack provides are out of bounds and won't continue.

But  this is romance, albeit more laden with issues (Pullman carloads of issues), a 2 week time limit and the problem of Jack. Yes, Jack. Hes a problem  or rather the pieces hes hiding from Katie are the problem.  Hes a natural with a rifle  and should be the hands-down frontrunner for Katies recommendation to the elite unit. But, he drinks  and that drinking and off-handed approach to his training has not gone unnoticed by the others in the class or his superiors.  Then we have Katie, in town for two weeks, uncertain about her attraction to Jack and some niggles that she doesnt know the whole story. But, every question results in some answers, a peek deeper into the pain and shame he feels, even as he seems to grow taller and more secure with her belief in him.  Chemistry  thats not a problem  they have that in spades. But its the unsaid, the unknown, and the unhealthy ways Jack uses to mask it all.

Bailey takes a man struggling with his past issues and guilt, remorse and self-loathing: just coasting through life because hes not worth the trouble, or worth people investing in him and making him worth the efforts of Katie to understand and start him healing.  Hes got a smidge of little boy lost in him: its Katie that brings him light and a possible path  but her worries for him could be all-consuming, and shes not sure that yet another obligation to her time or heart are possible.  Surprisingly deep and emotional, with the clear correlation of Jacks issues being both a stopping point and a chance for redemption and renewal, along with his determination to give back to Katie and help her achieve dreams  the story moves from revelation to steam to revelations, again and again.  His friends Charlie and Danika are large players in the story  wanting to help him, seeing the changes because of Katie, yet tired of the same lather, rinse, repeat that seem to be his pattern, they are supportive but oh so tired of his selfish behaviors and unwillingness or half-baked attempts to change.  Oh there is dirty talk and raw emotions, a huge revelation (that isn't a surprise as Bailey neatly and masterfully integrated hints and clues in before the reveal) and plenty of second-guessing, missteps and make-ups.  Surprised by both the depth and the poignancy of the tale, this is a favorite as issues are presented honestly, graphically and sympathetically: allowing a path to recovery and hope to shine through.

6473,131,1800,"INDECENT EXPOSURE is the second instalment in Tessa Baileys contemporary, adult THE ACADEMY erotic, romance series focusing on three police academy cadets: Charlie Burns, Jack Garrett and Danika Silva. This is cadet Jack Garrett, and Olympic Gold Medallist from Ireland and expert markswoman Katie McCoys story line. INDECENT EXPOSURE can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from the previous story line is revealed where necessary.

Told from dual first person points of view (Jack and Katie) INDECENT EXPOSURE follows police academy Jack Garrett as he battles demons from his past. Meeting the sexy Irish Katie McCoy had Jack dreaming of bigger plans for the evening only to come face to face with the Academys new firearms instructor-the same woman starring in his fantasies and dreams. Enter Katie McCoy, Olympic Gold Medallist from Ireland and expert markswoman, and the woman with whom Jack will fall in love. What ensues is the building relationship between Katie and Jack, and the potential fall out when Jacks past begins to slowly take over his life, and Katies time in New York, comes to a close.

Throughout the story line the reader is up close and personal with a man whose demons ride him hard; a past mired in dark secrets that manifest themselves with too much drinking and low self-esteem. Jack is the epitome of sexy, handsome, model-worthy eye candy but a man whose struggles are painful and sad.  Katie McCoy is a woman struggling with her place in the world; pulled in different directions wanting to please the family she has left behind.

The relationship between Jack and Katie is one of immediate attraction who met unofficially the night before their formal introductions. Never expecting to see one another again, the sparks begin to fly even though Katie begins to question Jacks involvement in the police academy training program. The $ex scenes are intimate and intense, but once again, I dislike the use of a certain four-letter word that has no place in a romance story line-Jack likes to talk dirty in the bedroom.

We are re-introduced to Jacks best friends, roommates and fellow police academy cadets: Charlie Burns and his girlfriend Ever (Disorderly Conduct #1), and Danika Silva, a woman who has caught the eye of the police academy instructor Lieutenant Greer Burns (Charlies brother).  Greer and Danikas story line is next in Disturbing His Peace.

INDECENT EXPOSURE is a story of family and friendship; acceptance and letting go of the past; of romance, love, and forgiveness. The character driven premise is captivating and revealing; the characters are driven, broken and colorful; the romance is energetic, provocative and passionate.",1517529600,4

6476,31,1802,"No matter the genre, I know I can always count on Jen to deliver one hell of a story. Midnight Sins definitely did that. And speaking of genre, I'm really not even sure where to place this one. It appears to be contemporary, if gothic, but... I still wonder if there's something else going on with the de Vincent family. I have thoughts, but I'll let you form your own opinion. Regardless, it was an addictive and engaging story with enough mystery to keep me guessing and a bit of a slow burn that gave away to a steamy af romance.

I'm on a roll here lately with the New Orleans books and I'm not sorry about about it. I find NOLA a fascinating city and it makes for a great book setting. While my other recent NOLA read focused on the fun and flirty side of the city, Moonlight Sins looks at the darker side of it, with a dark, lush and gothic vibe. I enjoyed the contrast between that and my earlier NOLA read.

Lucian was a mystery for the bulk of the book and, if I'm honest, there are still some questions that remain unanswered after I finished. I wouldn't exactly put him in the category of swoony book boyfriend, but there was something about him that got under my skin. He was intensely sexual and honest and never pretended to be anything else. He was an enigma and I find it hard to describe him as anything else. It was obvious Julia brought out another side of him and I enjoyed that.

Julia was a great heroine. She was strong, smart and brave. I enjoyed how she played off Lucian and the other characters in the book. But more than anything, I loved the way she made Lucian earn her. She was able to keep him at arm's length and keep him intrigued, which had to be fairly difficult with a man like him. Especially being under the same roof as him. I know I was all but screaming ""oh get it on already"" as I was reading. They were easy to root for, despite all their differences, and despite all the other freaky things going on in the book.

I'm not going to give away anything else about the plot of Moonlight Sins. It's an intense read that gave me more questions instead of answers as I was reading. Even now, I still have so many questions. I can't wait to read the next book in the series, either. The de Vincents are intriguing and I need more.",1517529600,4

6482,78,1784,"There was/is a lot of hype surrounding this book and it kept being recommended to me via Amazon and through my Facebook feed so I felt I had to buy it., however Ill be honest, I had little expectations... yet, I found that  The Woman in the Window is The Girl on the Train meets Rear Window - that well loved Hitchcock film based on a short story.  Hence making this one of the best twisted psychological thrillers I've read in a long time.

A.J. Finn has created a captivating character in Dr. Anna Fox - our protagonist. She suffers from agoraphobia resulting from a devastating incident that has significantly damaged her.  She mixes alcohol with her medication and spends her days looking out her windows at her neighbourhood.

Actually she spies on them, taking pictures with her camera.  Making up names and backstories where she does not know the truth and keeping careful watch of what they all get up to.  A new family moves in and Anna starts watching them as well.
One day, she hears a scream coming from the Russell's house, and she sees what she thinks could be a crime. But looks can be deceiving, especially if the watcher isn't exactly sober at the time, which is the police's attitude. Did Anna really see what she thought she saw and, if so, why are the Russell's lying?

This debut grabbed me from the first page, held me captive throughout. And if you love a book that is patient and slowly reveals itself to you before shocking you then you will love The Woman in the Window.

6485,1095,76,"This will remain my favourite book for a long, long time! Immaculately written. Not a dramatic story but you get so deeply involved in this man's narrow yet incredible life. Even though it should be melancholy it's very uplifting! A ""grand Budapest hotel"" feel to it",1517529600,5
6486,0,1691,"This is a well written story about a senior citizen, preacher, anticipating the end of his life.  The setting is a small town in Iowa.  The time frame is twentieth century America.  The protagonist is looking backward and composing a very lengthy letter to a young son about his life and the history of his family.  The story revolves around both history and faith.  It is a slow moving novel and not an ""action"" novel.

The novel itself is essentially one very long letter. It is written in first person.  The writer is a man of the cloth, who is seventy seven years of age, who has a medical condition and anticipates death.  He nonetheless has a very young son.  He feels he will die with his son having little or no memory of him.

I liked the novel very much.  There is a lot of narrative about faith.  At times, not always, the story sounds like a sermon in church.  This may not appeal the taste of every reader.  The story more or less meanders and there is little action.

This is the second novel of Marilynne Robinson.  The first is ""Housekeeping"".  I read that novel first.  I like both novels.  They are fairly mature and sophisticated novels.  I like this novel more than the first one.  However I am glad that I read both of them.

In summary I liked this novel very much and have become of a fan of Marilynne Robinson.  The story moves slowly and includes a lot of narrative about faith.  It may not suit the taste of every reader.  In case a reader enjoys Marilynne Robinson, for what it is worth, her writing reminds me somewhat of Joan Didion.  Thank You...",1517529600,5

6489,913,990,"This book was written in 1954 and not much has changed in the world of statistics since then - although much has changed in the world of salary levels and language! Using average salary levels of around $5,000 per annum to make a point is a little disconcerting. Likewise, describing statistical shenanigans by stating that equally gay fun is to be had with percentages is likely to be misconstrued today.  That said, only 24% of the book used time specific language which I found to be quaint and did not detract from the larger points the author makes.

Another 50 years or more before the book was first published, Disraeli famously noted there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.  It's all in the context. Huff's short and easy to read treatise attempts to put context into the world of statistics and how they can be used and manipulated to support a particular point of view.

6498,403,411,"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari is quite extensive in its scope despite the sub-title.  Harari covers the entire history of the species he calls Sapiens, from their unexceptional rise in Africa to their domination, and ultimate transformation of the world.

Harari is so inclusive that he often runs two lines of thought without trying to rectify them.  He stresses, quite correctly, that human evolution and dominance of the planet was an accident, and is by no means secure. But in other areas, he writes as if it is the destiny of Sapiens to grow more complex in their social arrangements; that it is fated.

He juggles these two balls throughout the book.  The author often treats Sapiens as animals, no more special than any others.  At other times, he presents Sapiens as destined creatures, so unique that they will surpass natural selection entirely with intelligence and technology.

This has been the cleavage that runs through our species self-conception since the rise of natural science.  In this book, the two streams can be a bit distracting, even annoying at times.  But Harari is presenting a work that is vast in its scope and aims; in a way, it seems fair to leave this part of the human experience unanswered and contradictory.  In the end it is the best approach to examine the history of our troubled species.",1517529600,4

Any time that I watch a movie and enjoy it, I assume that the book is far better, but in this case I enjoyed the movie more. Though, I feel like if I read this book before watching the movie I might feel differently.

The story is still enchanting and interesting, and the book doesn't take long to read. It is much shorter than I had imagined. I read this on my Kindle and was actually surprised when it said I had finished the book because I kept thinking that there might be something else, something very profound hidden within those last few lines of text, but I found the ending slightly underwhelming.

The first time I read this book was as a Senior in high school, I loved it then, and I seriously love it now as well.  It is a book filled with drama from a character who is calm and collected.  The love story so masterfully told that your heart races with each encounter.  Mr. Rochester is the epitome of mysterious alpha male, and in this setting he is as sexy as hell.  Jane is a strong noble character who is kind and giving of herself, but also always sticks up for herself in ways that any one can admire and respect.

However, now I see how terrible the alternative is:  Trewlove, Kipwick, TITTLEFITZ. What even IS that last one? I found the names so distracting that it was hard to focus on the actual story.

The plot itself had an interesting, albeit sad, base. Beyond Scandal and Desire is set around baby farming, or the practice of getting rid of bastards via widows who would, at the very least horribly mistreat the childrenand at the most, kill them. Its not something you would normally associate with a romance novel, and it was certainly deep. I found Mick, the hero, to be quite a strongly written charactermostly due to the backstory we got on this subject.

UnfortunatelyI found the rest of the characters to be rather shallow.

I thought it might be slow or wordy but this novel was non-stop action and there were times that I relistened to parts of it as events were occurring faster than I had anticipated and/or was prepared for.  I really enjoyed the ending where everything was revisited and the story was revealed piece-by-piece.

There were ten of them to start, ten individuals invited to the island to enjoy their holiday. These individuals had been chosen because they all had something in common, but what was this common link?  As they gathered in the dining room, they notice the glass figures positioned on the mantle, ten little Indian boys all standing in a row. Above this small display is a poetic phrase that describes these glass figurines. This lyrical edition and the matching figures were reproduced in each of the guests bedrooms with an additional set of figurines on the dining room table.  I enjoyed how important they become to the novel and to the guests as their holiday was far from their original expectations.

The number of guests begins to dwindle as the number of deaths on the island increases.  They were dying at an alarming rate and no one could figure out who the murderer was.  Their chances of returning to the main land was slim as they didn't have anything to carry them across.  The guests were trying to stick together yet, death still found them.

SUMMARY
Angela Powell's life looked pretty amazing to outside observers. She had Jason, her successful, handsome husband; Spencer, her beloved thirteen year old son and an incredible multi-million dollar home in Manhattan. She appeared to be living the dream life of an over-privileged NYC housewife. But what most people didn't know was that she had a painful secret from her past which continued to haunt her.

Things seemed to be going well for the Powell family until an intern with Jason's company came forward and accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior. Jason brushed it off as a misunderstanding and Angela believed him. The media got a hold of the story pretty quickly since Jason was an author and a minor celebrity, creating a whirlwind of bad press. The Powell's hired a very tough lawyer and the intern was quickly discredited. Just as the story began to die and public favor seemed to sway back toward Jason, another woman came forward accusing him of raping her.

The Powell family was once again in the center of a media frenzy. Both women threatened to sue Jason and take all the family's assets. The negative attention was destroying Jason's career and the attorney was costing a fortune. Their son Spencer was suffering at school and disappointing things about Jason were beginning to come to Angela's attention. But worst of all, Angela was worried about keeping her secret. No matter what, that secret needed to stay buried.

To add fuel to the fire, one of the women goes missing and guess who the start questioning immediately??? Jason, of course.

Does Angela even know the man she married? Is he capable of rape? Murder?",1517616000,4

6522,608,906,"I was disappointed in this novel, I mean for how much people have talked about it and then a movie is made based on this novel, seriously this book needs work.  I was so frustrated reading it, I almost stopped and put it away but since I am reading it for a book club I thought I better continue.  Why was I so frustrated?  It felt so glossy, it never hit on anything important to this time period, it was too juvenile.  I read a lot of childrens and young adult novels, novels that pertain to this time period and this one was one major letdown for me.

In the beginning of the novel, I liked Brunos confusion and innocence as his family is being relocated because the Fury has big plans for his father.  Nine-year-old Bruno knows nothing about what his father does, only that he is important to the Fury and Bruno sees this move as a great adventure.

In the new house, his twelve-year-old sister has a forest view out her window but as Bruno looks out his window, his view becomes confusing the further out he gazes.  Theyre both hoping to find new friends at their new home, as they miss what they had in Berlin.  Asking his father about the groups of individuals that he sees out his window, Bruno realizes that the chance of any of them becoming his friend is none as his father tells him that they're not people at all, Bruno, and he has nothing whatsoever in common with them.  This doesnt stop Brunos curiosity about them yet all through the novel, Bruno is left in the dark.  I felt as though he had plenty of opportunity to be educated, to discover what exactly was going on, yet he doesnt. What about Brunos family?  How can they leave him in the dark while he is living within feet of a death camp?  Did his sister know anything about it since shes older, did they talk?  He had to have heard something from all the individuals coming and going inside their house.

Bruno sees a fence line from his window and he was told to keep away from it yet he doesnt. He takes this chance and when he does, he proves his father wrong.  He comes upon Shmuel, who is a person and he does have something in common with Bruno.  I enjoyed this innocent friendship and bond as it started to form.  Bruno has lots of questions about the people in the striped pajamas and I was hoping that Shmuel would explain things to him but it seems I was only hoping.  They spent lots of time together, these two young boys, talking between the wire fence, I mean a lot of time together and seriously Bruno learns nothing about the truth on Shmuels side of the fence.

I did like the ending.  I think that is the only thing that saved this novel for me.  Moving on",1517616000,2

They weren't described and brought alive. Especially the elegance of the castle and the dresses. There was only one beautiful dress in this story that was described and made me tingle.  It was more about the Princess and her arrogance and learning about herself. The first 3 held such an adventure and were humorous and scary ..they were page turners.  This story was about a self-absorbed princess and her inner struggles. There weren't any characters you could care any about. So, sorry, it didn't hold the same enchantment as the first 3.",1517616000,2

I told her it's about a Russian Count who is sentenced to life imprisonment inside a Moscow luxury hotel. Her response was, that doesn't sound very interesting.

As the world around her changes and unrest among people intensifies with the uncertainty of humanity's future, Cedar Songmaker internalizes the change in a very personal manner as she's among the people the government would like to round up: pregnant women. Before telling her adoptive parents about her pregnancy, Cedar feels compelled to find her birth mother and learn more about her to better inform herself on her and her child's origins. After meeting her birth mother, Cedar goes back home only to find that pregnant women are encouraged and/or forced to report to medical facilities to provide ""appropriate"" medical care. Having hidden for much of her pregnancy with hopes of keeping off the radar until her child is born, Cedar offers an experience on the martial law outside of the norm as she winds up getting detained, escaping with the help of her mother, and getting detained yet again before she gives birth, where her diary of experiences and thoughts ceases.

Written in the style of a diary for her child to read, this novel documents the fleeting thoughts Cedar has relating to her fetus and her sense of identity as she learns more about her birth mother. The narrative was slow to build toward the dystopia the world as devolved to - for much of the beginning, the world appears to be a reflection of contemporary America as Cedar seeks out her biological parents, which makes the appearance of the dystopian elements a bit jarring in contrast to the story's initial presentation. There wasn't enough details in building the world of the narrative to take the interesting concepts presented (reverse evolution is so intriguing!) into a realm where the situation can be fully realized and developed.",1517616000,3

6537,398,940,"Black Widow is one of the latest (#16) in Silvas popular 17-book series starring Israeli master intelligence agent Gabriel Allon. As with many recent international thrillers, it explores the bevy of Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere, specifically by ISIS herein; and the plot features the cooperation between mostly France and Israel to find one of the leading masterminds responsible. To do so, they train (almost to the point of brainwashing) a female operative, a doctor named Natalie but now identified as Laila, with a deep back story to boot, to infiltrate ISIS sufficiently to uncover the identity of one of its most significant leaders. For once, her role probably consumed more ink than Allon himself.

The trouble with books that too closely mirror current events is that we readers get such a heavy dose of this type of news with breakfast that then reading fictional accounts of the same don't really provide much escapism. Indeed, the author explains in a forward note that he and his publishers nearly withheld the novel as it too closely virtually predicted real occurrences.

We notice several reviewers were upset at Silvas criticism, both in the fictional narrative and in an essay at books end, of past US Presidents, especially Obama, for failed policy with regard to Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet one can hardly fail to observe American arrogance (foolishness?) in trying to install democracy in lands where infighting over religion, geography, and power has been ongoing for millenniums!

That said, the tales resemblance to reality did little to diminish the suspense generated, but the extreme violence was probably not our cup of tea. Having now read half the set, we suspect we can be better entertained elsewhere. {2.5}",1517702400,2

6540,1075,16,"I read The Hate U Give to fulfill a prompt for the 2018 POPSUGAR Advanced Reading Challenge ( A book about a problem facing society today).
16-year-old Starr Carter is the only witness when a police officer shoots and kills her childhood best friend, Khalil. What follows is a deep, engrossing story that deals with racism, police violence, gang culture, interracial relationships, and so much more.

The author does a fantastic job of bringing you into Starrs world and exploring the two sides of herself. On one hand, she is Starr from the hood, who works in her fathers store. On the other hand, she is Starr, one of only 2 black students in her high school that her parents drive miles out of their way to have her attend so she has better opportunities than she would if she attended the one in her neighborhood.

Starr feels she cant let these two versions of herself intersect, so it causes a lot of internal struggle which would be tough for anyone, let alone a 16-year-old who is still trying to mature and find their way.

Khalils death causes Starr to have to break down the borders she has, and try to start resolving her two different worlds, not just for her own sake, but for that of Khalils memory, the people of her neighborhood, and beyond.

Hard to believe this was Thomas debut novel, as everything about this was so well put together. I loved Starrs finally dynamics. Its important to see what s trong family looks like, regardless of their skin color. The Carter family is #relationshipgoals. Yes, they fight with each other, no they're not perfect people, but they love each other and that love makes them work harder to do whats best for each other.

Billionaire Elon Musk is a businessman, engineer, and inventor with a radical vision for the future of mankind. In fact Musk wants nothing less than to establish a human colony on Mars.....with a view toward exploring Jupiter's moon Europa someday.

Musk fears there will be another mass extinction event - like the asteroid that destroyed 75% of Earth's species at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary 65 million years ago - and he wants people to have somewhere to go. I agree with Musk that Earth is likely to become inhospitable to humans someday, but I fear we'll ruin the planet ourselves - with over-exploitation, pollution, war, and disease. (And then we'd probably do the same thing to Mars. I'm a skeptic.)

In any case, Musk puts his money where his mouth is. In 2002 the audacious entrepeneur founded the rocket company SpaceX. SpaceX is already launching satellites for several countries, and carrying supplies to the International Space Station. In the future, Musk wants rockets to bring people, equipment, and provisions to the red planet.....ideally in the next 50 to 100 years.

SpaceX is just one of Musk's far-sighted enterprises. In this book Ashlee Vance explores Musk's various business ventures, and provides insight into the developer's character and personal life.

Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa in 1971. He had a difficult childhood, being viciously bullied at school and tormented by his father, Errol. The book has few details about Errol's behavior (no one will talk about it), but it's revealing that grandpa Musk isn't allowed to meet Elon's five sons.

As a youngster Elon devoured books, and - with his photographic memory - recalled everything he read. Elon was also an inventive child who built rockets and created video games. When he was 17-years-old Elon moved to his mother's home country, Canada.....and the penniless teen bunked with relatives, did odd jobs, and went to school. Eventually, Elon ended up at the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in economics and physics. Musk then moved to California and entered the business world.

Vance did extensive research and describes Musk's business projects in elaborate detail, including: how they started; financing; development; failures; successes; leadership; personnel; buy-outs; etc. Musk's trajectory didn't go straight from start-up to billionaire. Far from it. In fact the developer nearly went bankrupt several times....to the glee of naysayers and jealous rivals. Musk carried on, though, and was successul in the end. (So yay Elon!....and pooh on the guys who tried to take him down!)

In this brief review I'll just provide a quick summary of Musk's business activities. For a full picture, you'll have to read the book.

Musk's first venture after college was Zip2 - a kind of online Yellow Pages/Mapquest that allowed users to find businesses and get directions. When Zip2 was sold, Musk founded an internet banking venture that became PayPal. These were profitable pursuits that provided money for additional investments.

Musk founded SpaceX - the aforementioned rocket company in 2002, and co-founded Tesla Motors - which manufactures environmentally friendly electric cars in 2003. Then, in 2006, Musk helped his cousins launch SolarCity - a company that fabricates, markets, and installs solar panels.

Among other things, Tesla and SolarCity are meant to reduce the use of fossil fuels and lower carbon pollution....which would help preserve the Earth and its inhabitants. In this vein, Musk also hopes to build 'hyperloops' - high speed trains that travel on a loop between major cities like New York and Washinton DC; and Los Angeles and San Francisco. President Obama is said to be a fan of this project.

Musk's various ventures require smart, capable personnel and the developer was (and is) always on the lookout for the brightest students, the best engineers, the most foreward-thinking inventors, and so on. Musk is notoriously difficult to work for and - when he wants something done - refuses to hear ""I can't do it."" If you really can't do it, Musk is likely to let you go and do it himself. Musk expects employees to work long hours without complaint.....and has a reputation for upbraiding and firing personnel. Thus, he's quite ruthless on a business level.

In private life, though, Musk is said to be a fun guy who likes to make jokes; laugh; attend costume parties; play video games with his kids; and generally have a good time. Musk has five sons - twins and triplets - from his first marriage to Justine Musk and is now wed to the actress Tallulah Riley. The entrepeneur has a brutal work schedule - he often works 100 or more hours per week - but takes his sons all over the world with him. Musk is also close to his brother and cousins, and often collaborates with them on business projects.

In addition to influencing national and international corporations, Musk has impacted popular culture. After the actor, Robert Downey Jr., visited the SpaceX factory, he modeled aspects of his character 'Tony Stark' (Iron Man) on the billionaire entrepreneur. And Musk guest starred on an episode of 'The Simpsons' called 'The Musk Who Fell to Earth.' The Simpsons segment is hilarious and gives a cartoonish - but probably accurate....picture of the entrepreneur as an imaginative inventor and concerned citizen of the Earth. (The episode is available on YouTube.)

Vance's discussions of the ups and downs of Musk's businesses are especially well-researched and interesting. The author explains how Tesla ultimately built an electric roadster that's beautiful, comfortable, kid-seat friendly, and (more or less) reasonably-priced (if you're rich); and how a rocket was finally launched after heartbreaking failures due to mechanical errors, sloshing fuel, and other hard-to-foresee factors.

Vance also discusses the problems involved when private companies - like Musk's enterprises - compete with established (though inferior) businesses that have government support. Some corporations are beloved by politicians because of monetary contributions, lobbyists, factories in their districts; etc. It's hard to compete with such companies, and they caused massive headaches for Musk. But, of course, he prevailed in the end.

I admire Musk for his brilliance and accomplishments, and I like this book. I'd recommend the book to readers interested in Elon Musk; his far-reaching business ventures; and the future of the planet.",1517702400,4

6545,69,1455,"Lauren Belfer's ""And After the Fire"" spans hundreds of yearsfrom eighteenth century Prussia to twenty-first century New York City.  The focus is a piece of music--ostensibly composed by Johann Sebastian Bach--that was never publicly performed. Why was it hidden for centuries?  In 2010, Susanna Kessler, a thirty-four year old woman who works for a philanthropic foundation, finds what appears to be a Bach cantata that her uncle acquired during the Second World War.  Kessler asks a noted scholar, Professor Daniel Erhardt, to authenticate the manuscript.  She knows that if her discovery turns out to be a previously unknown composition by the great master, she will need expert advice on what steps she should take next.

The author skillfully blends fact and fiction, and has done prodigious research to lend authenticity to her depiction of such real-life characters as Felix  Mendelssohn, his sister Fanny, and Sara Itzig Levy. Mrs. Levy, the daughter of Frederick the Great's banker, Daniel Itzig, was a brilliant harpsichordist and prized student of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach.  Sara had a large and loving family, many of whom were also musically talented. This book explores the limitations placed on such accomplished women as Sara and Fanny, and the undercurrents of anti-Semitism that existed even when affluent Jews were prominent members of Berlin society. Martin Luther and others planted seeds of hatred towards Jews that would bear poisonous fruit during the Nazi era.

""And After the Fire"" has its flaws.  This long and sometimes rambling narrative frequently moves back and forth in time, making it difficult to keep track of its large cast of characters. In addition, the plot is weighed down by melodramatic elements and a predictable romance. In spite of its imperfections, this work of historical fiction is worth reading for its colorful account of the ways in which music, religion, and culture intersected in the past and continue to do so today. Furthermore, Belfer shows that the inevitable challenges we face may drive us to reexamine our priorities.  When we do so, we can make choices that reflect our self-interest as well as our moral values.",1517702400,4

Love, List, and the List by Kasie West
Publisher: HarperTeen
Publication Date: December 26, 2017
Rating: 4 stars
Source: ARC sent by the publisher

Summary (from Goodreads):

Everyone knows Abby Turner is in love with her best friend, Cooper Wells. Including Cooper Wells. But despite what people tell her, it doesnt affect their friendship. And shes practically over it, anyway. What she really cant get over is when her boss at the local museum tells her that her paintings lack heart.

Art is Abbys passion and she hopes her future as well. She is determined to change his mind and earn her way into the upcoming exhibit at the gallery. So along with her familys help, she compiles The Heart List, a series of soulstretching experiences that are sure to make her a deeper person and better artist in six weeks or less. When Cooper decides to complete the list along with her, she realizes this list is expanding her heart in more ways than one. Maybe she needs to start another project.

Love, Life, and the List is about a girl who, in an effort to bring more emotional depth to her art, compiles a list of soul-stretching experiences to complete with her best frienda boy she also happens to be in love with.

This is the first in a set of three standalone books with crossover characters.

What I Liked:

I'd seen early reviews of this book and for some reason, I thought I wouldn't enjoy the book. I've read all of West's books. Her latest two books, By Your Side and Lucky in Love, were okay, but not my favorites. I missed the earlier stories like The Distance Between Us and The Fill-In Boyfriend. Personally, I thought Love, Life, and the List, was more like Kasie West's older stuff. It was sweet, thought-provoking, and very shippy.

Abby has the whole summer ahead of her, and she plans to work at the art museum, and hopefully ask the director to feature her paintings in an upcoming exhibit gallery for which she technically doesn't mean the requirements. But Mr. Wallace tells her that while her art is good, it lacks ""heart"". And so begins the Heart List, which includes ten things that Abby will try to do give her more experiences and depth. With the help of her best friend Cooper, who she has been in love with for years, she hopes to gain new experiences to be able to improve her painting, so she can paint five new paintings for the exhibit - if Mr. Wallace lets her feature her work. But in trying to expand her experiences, she also opens her heart.

This is probably West's longest novel, clocking in at 384 pages. It takes place over a summer between junior and senior year of high school. Abby is one fourth of a friend group, including herself, Cooper, Rachel, and Justin. Rachel is off to Europe with her family, and Justin is doing religious work in South America, and that leaves Abby and Cooper. This sounds great in theory, except a year ago, Abby declared her feelings for Cooper... and that wasn't well-received. So she played it off as a joke and a year later, they are still friends. But the more they hang out, trying to cross things off her Heart List, the more she feels herself falling for him (like she ever stopped to begin with).

Abby is driven by her desire to want her artwork showcased in the exhibit, despite her not meeting the age requirement. I liked seeing this drive in a Kasie West heroine - oftentimes, the heroines are kind of go-with-the-flow, not terrible driven. Not wrong with that, but it was nice to see things shaken up, even if Abby was laid back in various regards. I liked Abby; her determination to improve her painting was really respectable. Her persistence in getting her work showcased was admirable. And her ability to stay friends with the guy she has been in love with for forever - very remarkable.

Abby has the trademark sarcasm and wit that most West heroines have. She is hilarious and definitely someone I would get along with. I love her interactions with Cooper. Both of them are witty and funny, and their senses of humor mesh well. It's so clear that they are meant for each other! They make great friends but they care about each other so much, and they get along so well. I love seeing that kind of friendship but it's even more fun when that kind of friendship becomes more.

I suppose, in terms of the romance, you can kind of infer what happens here. There's unrequited love on Abby's part, as Cooper sort of shut her down a year ago, with everything he could have said but didn't. Abby wants to get over Cooper but he always had a hold on her heart. This was a bit heartbreaking to watch because I've so been there with a former best male friend, and I know how it hurts. Still, I found Cooper and Abby's friendship really fun and sweet, and to me it always seemed like they had great chemistry. I thought Cooper was fairly swoony! Even if he did have his mouth shut during the entire book, in terms of the romance.

I won't say more on the romance but I promise it's cute! It's very slow-burn and definitely worth the wait. I had a feeling things would work out as they did and I'm not complaining.

There isn't a ton of drama in this book, though there were times when I wasn't sure how the romance would end, or how the book would end in general. Trust me when I say that any ""drama"" in this book is very minimal and doesn't affect the romance.

As with most of West's books, there are some ""tough issues"" in this story that are important but don't bog down the story. Abby's mother deals with anxiety and it becomes a key point in the book, when Abby's mother does something that ends up making Abby really upset. I thought West wrote about the mental disorder well, and the resolution was good too.

I loved the ending! It's so sweet. Things work out for Abby, for the Heart List, for the paintings, for her relationship with her mother, father, and grandfather, for her friends. I have no complaints about the ending! I love a good HEA.

What I Did Not Like:

I always want more physical swoons in West's books! I think that's something that I always say in my reviews of her books. No one does swoony contemporary romance like she does! But I always want more kissing. Always!

Would I Recommend It:

I really enjoyed this book and I definitely recommend it! I didn't have issues with it like some others might have. It's a sweet, swoony read and I breezed right through it so it's also a quick one. I was so relieved when I liked it because I didn't want to feel meh about yet another West book!

Rating:

4 stars. My faith is restored! I absolutely cannot wait to read more by West, like Listen to Your Heart. I believe there will be books to follow this one (Love, Life, and the List) that feature crossover characters, so I'm excited about that! Hopefully Rachel, or Justin, or Lacey, or Elliott. Or some combination of them!",1517702400,4

6550,598,1510,"This novel is easy to read, easy to get into, and impossible to put down.  I loved the many twists and turns, and the flawed characters.

Angela Powell's perfect life is shattered shortly after the book begins.  Her husband is being accused of some type of sexual misconduct by an intern at his office, which he blows off when he explains it to her.  This sets off a chain of events that destroy the happy, predictable life Angela has so carefully constructed.  And as the story unfolds secrets are revealed.  Readers won't be able to predict the many twists and turns of the story, which certainly brings up the question of how well you can ever really know someone.

6554,405,819,"Yes, you've read (or seen) a thriller about an agoraphobic woman before.  And yes, this takes elements from a lot of other sources like The Girl on the Train, Vertigo, and Rear Window.  That said, it's a vastly better read than most big-release thrillers.  Along with Midnight at the Bright Ideas Bookstore, it kind of restores my faith in the genre.  Go read that stinkfest The Girl Before for comparison and you'll see what I mean.

I like the main character Anna for her clever dialogue and thoughts.  She's a mess but also well read and satirical in a way I find refreshing (love that a male author wrote a woman character who wasn't just a super-hot, karate-kicking assassin who knows how to fix cars).  For an agoraphobic, Anna probably puts herself out there more than a lot of us, but okay, that was to keep the plot from feeling too lonely.  The drunkenness is a bit much considering we all just read Girl on the Train which had the same device mentioned ad nauseam, but still.  Overall I liked this a lot.

6555,837,592,"First let me start by saying this isn't a genre I read , but thought Id try it for something different.  I read a lot of nonfiction, so you need to suspend your belief in reality a bit to get into this.  Once you do that, its a wild ride. Weird, unusual, a bit gruesome but not bad.  The tension ramps up throughout the book. If youve ever watched the old TV show Jericho, this reminded me of that in certain ways. Not the same danger, but a story where the more people that can gather together in a safe space , the better they can possibly find a solution to some of the challenges they are facing. As said previously, this was definitely out of my normal comfort zone, but it was actually quite good. You NEED to keep reading to find out the ending.",1517788800,4

I really enjoyed this book. I have been wanting to read Koontz' novels for years. I just never got around to it. If you saw the extent of my TBR pile, you'd understand. I still need to find a place to add more bookshelves for the books that are piled everywhere, but I digress. This was a really amazing and intense read. I didn't want it to end!

The narrator was pretty fantastic too. I do think he could have worked a little more on adding some more personality to the voices. But he did a pretty good job on that too. I'd like to read some other books he's narrated to see if he's just as good with them as he is with this one.

I do fully recommend this book. I am ashamed it's taken me so long to get into a Koontz novel, but it's better late than never. This is not the first book I've read from him and it won't be the last. He's an amazing writer who definitely knows how to pull at some emotional strings.",1517788800,5

I decided to read Death on the Nile which will be the second Poirot film in this new canon. I have read a bunch Christies and will say that this book is up there with some of my favorites. The characters were fully realized and it kept me guessing till the end and while I was shocked it was a very Christie ending. The descriptions of Egypt made me look up tours. I felt like I was on the boat on the Nile with an eccentric bunch of characters. I will warn all who have never read a Christie that you need to read them as part of the time period. In this climate of Times Up and Me Too the female character in this book are very stereotypical to the time. I found myself saying nooooo she didn't just say that. But I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.

Following the success of Murder on the Orient Express directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, Twentieth Century Fox will next adapt this classic Hercule Poirot mystery for the big screen.
Beloved detective Hercule Poirot embarks on a journey to Egypt in one of Agatha Christies most famous mysteries, Death on the Nile.
The tranquility of a cruise along the Nile was shattered by the discovery that Linnet Ridgeway had been shot through the head. She was young, stylish, and beautiful. A girl who had everything . . . until she lost her life.
Hercule Poirot recalled an earlier outburst by a fellow passenger: ""I'd like to put my dear little pistol against her head and just press the trigger."" Yet in this exotic setting nothing is ever quite what it seems.",1517788800,4

6566,679,399,"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold by John le Carr is another immensely popular bestseller that I found to be immensely mediocre.  Several Booker Prize winners go on this list.  Perhaps at the time it was published it hit a target in readers souls but by now it only seems somewhat silly, overheated, implausible, irrelevant.  Reading this, assuming it represents some kind of genuine reality of Cold War espionage, I kept thinking how futile, silly, how irrelevant.  It is seriously dated.

John le Carr writes with verve and energy.  He creates an interesting character in Leamas, but parts of the storytelling are unnecessarily obscure sort of in the manner of Henry James.  The relationship between Leamas and Liz I think is entirely unconvincing.  Ditto that she was a Communist.  Etc.  I wonder, sadly, if much of the popularity of the book was (is?) its shallow anti-Communism.",1517788800,3
6567,467,234,"Not really my first pick from an entertainment standpoint. It did make me think though. I question our society today and consider the injustice and inequality that exist, although I have experienced very little myself. I know it's out there and this book although extreme at the time of publishing isn't as extreme considering what exists in some parts of the world today. I will be more mindful of being an advocate for equality in every form because this book makes you stop and think about what if? And what would I do? Would I let this happen?",1517788800,3
6568,350,1832,"I read Pachinko last year and loved it.  Based on that, I decided to read Ms. Lees debut novel Free Food for Millionaires.  It also received a lot of critical praise.  I am ambivalent about this book because while I found it compulsively readable, I did not really enjoy the story and I did not like or relate to the characters.  I even considered not finishing it.  I say it was compulsively readable because despite not liking it very much, I really wanted to find out what happened to the characters and how the book ended.  I think this speaks to Ms. Lees gift as a story telleryou are hooked even if you don't like the book!

Free Food takes place in New York City in the 1990s.  Casey Han, oldest daughter of Korean immigrants, has just graduated from Princeton with a degree in economics and no job.  She has a successful white boyfriend, an abusive father, and a younger sister who is the perfect child headed off to medical school.  Casey covets beautiful and expensive things, cannot afford them, but buys them anyway.  She has wealthy friends and a very wealthy mentor, but many of these relationships also have a price.  Casey has talent as a hat designer, but thinks that working on Wall Street is the only way to succeed.  The novel also focuses on one of Caseys friends who chooses a husband and baby over a career; Caseys passive and unhappy but musically gifted naive mother; her self-made mentor; and various co-workers and boyfriends.  Everyone is searching and no one seems happy in work or romance.  The ending was happy for most of the characters and it was a bit predictable.

I found it interesting to read Ms. Lees novels in reverse order.  You can really see the growth and maturity of the writer.  The multi-generational story in Pachinko is better written, I cared about the fate of the characters even if I did not like them, and the prose was gorgeous.  I also thought that the Korean immigrant experience was better articulated in Pachinko than in Free Food for Millionaires.  Free Food seemed more like a soap opera to me.  On the strength of Pachinko, I am eagerly awaiting her third book!",1517788800,3
6569,808,199,"""If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book. In this book, not only is there no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and very few happy things in the middle. This is because not very many happy things happened in the lives of the three Baudelaire youngsters. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire were intelligent children, and they were charming, and resourceful, and had pleasant facial features, but they were extremely unlucky, and most everything that happened to them was rife with misfortune, misery, and despair. I'm sorry to tell you this but that is how the story goes.""

Browsing the Goodreads reviews, this infamous series certainly provokes some hilarious responses, although some of them made me wonder if they had actually read the book:

""I started reading this out loud to my kids, but had to stop a few chapters into the book. They didn't get the humor of this book at all and were appalled by the events.""

""It was well-written, but I only gave it 3 stars because the cruelty to children in the book made me uneasy. And there's no happy ending in sight because this series is, after all, a series of unfortunate events.""

""This book was a bit odd, to say the least. I really didn't like that the author would occasionally give the definition of a word he had used since it took me out of the story.""

""The feelings this book evoked in me were... violent. Not because Lemony Snicket has written a book where terribly unfortunate things happen to small children - I have no problems with that and in fact encourage it; it builds character. I want to do violence towards Lemony Snicket because he's a terrible writer who should never have been allowed to have his words put to paper.""

""Fun and had a good atmosphere.""

Perhaps, the last one had me the most flummoxed. If parents dying and children being mistreated is fun and creates a good atmosphere......

As an adult reader, I thought the idea was quite clever and found the definitions of words mid-sentence entertaining because often the explanation was just as complex as the original word. I'm sure, despite the many comments to the contrary, no children's vocab will actually be enhanced through the reading of this book.

I agree with one reviewer, who felt rather more strongly about the subject than do I, that the writing is elementary. It just goes to show that all those people who insist that you have to be a good writer to make the best seller lists are wrong. So, there is hope for us all.

Rated 3 as it's intriguing but I'm not sure I'd be gifting it to my nephews and nieces as they are quite sensitive souls.

I leave you with this comforting image:

""It seemed to the children that they were moving in an aberrant- the word ""aberrant"" here means ""very, very wrong and causing much grief""- direction.""",1517788800,3
6570,580,1235,"I didn't need to read the synopsis for Ride Wild to decide if I wanted to read it or not - I already knew that I wanted to. Ive loved the first two books in the Raven Riders series and I figured the same would be true for the third book as well. And when I found out that the book was Cora and Sliders, I was beyond excited to start Ride Wild because I couldn't wait to learn more about Cora and Slider, especially Slider. I had high expectations for this story and Ms. Kaye completely surpassed them all. Ride Wild was absolutely amazing and I loved every minute of reading it!

I liked Cora before, but now that Ive been in her head, I love her! Cora is a strong, brave, giving woman, shes an excellent friend, and she would do anything for someone she loves. Shes funny and light and sweet even with all her dark parts. Cora is generous and has a heart of gold and I know that youll love her just as much as I and the Evans men do.

I have wanted to read Sliders story ever since we met him and there was definitely a little screaming when I realized that Ride Wild was his book. I like the whole quiet, seemingly emotionless guy and I was so eager to dive in and discover all about Slider. And Slider was every bit as wonderful as I was hoping for! Hes unbelievably sweet and so good to his boys and Cora. Hes had to deal with a lot and hes been going through the motions for awhile, but I loved watching him find happiness again. Slider and Cora are gems and they might just be my favorite Raven couple!

It took me longer than I anticipated to read Ride Wild, but if the choice had been mine, I wouldnt have stopped reading until I finished. Ride Wild was exciting, entertaining, and exhilarating. It was full of heartache, passion, and depth. It made me laugh and want to cry at times, it made me smile and warmed my heart, and allowed me to get lost and fall in love just like Slider and Cora. It was a beautiful, superb read and its the best and my favorite in the Raven Riders series so far!

Ride Wild can be read as a standalone, its told from Slider and Coras POV, and they do get their happily-ever-after.",1517788800,5
6571,558,1800,"Okay, seriously, I have a new book boyfriend. I am wholeheartedly in love with Jack Garrett in Indecent Exposure, and all his perfectly imperfect perfection.

I knew when I met Jack in Disorderly Contact that his story was going to be deep and thoughtful and hit me hard. And, damn, I was right!

Jack's in a bit of a conundrum. He's closed off and holds all of his emotions inside. He doesn't want to feel anything for any length of time. Until he meets Katie McCoy and he's suddenly feeling a whole lot of things and he's not quite prepared to deal with it all. And when Katie works her way under his skin and into his heart, is he going to be able to share everything he's been holding inside with her?

Katie's finally doing something for herself--and celebrating the life of her brother. She's in New York to train the recruits at the police academy, and she can't deny the attraction for Jack. One of her bucket list items is a quick and dirty NYC fling--and Jack's a perfect candidate. Until he turns out to be more. More of everything.

I so very much enjoyed the budding romance between Katie and Jack. Loved how they saw the best in each other, even when at their worst. Their interactions were fun, sexy, smart and fun. Well, mostly. I loved how they were so real with each other too. Even through the hard discussions. And I loved how Danika and Charlie and Ever supported Jack, with tough love sometimes too. Theirs is a true friendship. Up next is Danika and Greer in Disturbing His Peace and I cannot wait!",1517788800,5
6572,790,58,"Six pounds. Three volumes. 2,289 pages. Seven years in the making. Author Greg Iles The Natchez Burning Trilogy is simply a literary masterpiece. When the final volume Mississippi Blood was released nearly one year ago, this reader obtained a signed copy, waiting for the perfect time to begin the final journey. With Arizona February weather in the 70s/80s now was the time.

This saga concerns Natchez Mayor Penn Cage, his family and his friends. It also concerns evil known at the Double Eagles, an offshoot of the KKK, who from the 60s through more recent days were engaged in numerous illegal activities while behaving as the ultimate racists in heavily black Mississippi.

Mayor Cages father, Dr. Tom Cage, who had a 7-week affair with his black nurse years ago had been charged with murdering his former lover, who is dying of cancer and wanted to be injected with a fatal dose of morphine. Mayor Cage searches for the answers that can prove his father non-guilty. At the same time, the Double Eagles want to eliminate any and all that can bare witness against the murders and rapes these men have done in the past. As such there is violence. Actually, a whole lot of violence.

In Mississippi Blood the trial of Dr. Cage finally begins. It is simply an artistry of legal surprises that keeps the reader glued to the book. And as for violence, it continues through the last chapter. For those reading this, that have not read any of the trilogy, they must be read in the order of when they were published.

As a fan of Greg Iles novels, 3  years ago, this reader and his wife took a road-trip to spend some time in Natchez visiting every scene mentioned in his earlier works. We did not want to leave as it felt we were part of a novel. Perhaps it is time to go back. Good job Mr. Iles!",1517788800,5

Of course, with Beverly Jenkins pretty much anything is possible. This book had so much more going for it than just an enthralling meet-cute, though.

My favorite scenes are when Archer's team are all together. I have loved that in each of the books. Actually the group scenes are always the most entertaining in Jill's Heartbreaker Bay series. Their dynamics make interesting dialogue. I didn't ever really like Joe and Kylie as a couple. So much back and forth. Plus the suspense part took over the story, but not in a good way. I was also surprised at some of the story editing mistakes. However, I will continue to go along with the series because it is a good one.",1517788800,3

6580,199,768,"I'm not sure when this book was published, but given what's going on in Trump's America, if you don't read this and feel horror, you should. What happens in a world when the legitimate press is maligned and called ""fake news""? When the justice system and law enforcement are said not to be trusted and maybe downright evil? When a percentage of the people believe anything and everything they are told; even if what is told are proven lies? Is total chaos and anarchy too far a stretch? And a man who couldn't quote a verse from the Bible if his life depended on it convinces the religious right that he's a messiah? If you don't think we're in trouble, you're either naive or a true believer. I should, perhaps, have given this book 5 stars. It's not that it wasn't probably worth 5--just that it was so upsetting when you realize that we are being controlled to a large extent by the very tweets, emails,  Facebook messesages, etc, that the villains in this book used to enact their nefarious plans.

6585,159,819,"I feel like I've hit the mother load with the books I've read so far this year. I can't remember the last time I've had so many ""best of the year"" picks within the first two months. Whether it's historical fiction or mystery/thrillers they've all exceeded my expectations. The Woman in the Window, a dark, twisty, noir-style novel, fits right in within this wealth of literature I've been blessed to read so far this year.

 Anna, the main character in The Woman in the Window,  is the epitome of an unreliable narrator. She's an alcoholic drug-abuser who bald-faced lies about her addictions and her...let's call them ""unusual"" daily habits. These daily habits include watching endless old black-and-white Hitchcock thrillers and spying on her neighbors through a high-powered camera, making up little stories that go along with their lives. She's stuck in her house due to severe agoraphobia, which was brought on by an unbelievably tragic set of circumstances that the reader doesn't fully learn about until about half way through. So, for much of the beginning, you just have to guess at what has caused her mental illness, which is even more perplexing given her previous career as a psychologist and her clearly being quite intelligent. She knows when she is being irrational, drinking too much, or not taking her many pills correctly, and yet...she keeps doing it. All this calls into question the experiences she relates to the reader and what she believes she sees and hears happening at the new neighbors, the Russells's, house. This confusion makes the story so delicious and also makes it hard to stop reading as you want to keep going to see what is really happening and what isn't real. And, I'm happy to say, there's enough of both occurrences to please any reader.

 I've read a few reviews of The Woman in the Window that mention that the beginning of the story is somewhat slow going. I have to say that, for me, I didn't find this to be exactly the case. The beginning is setting up this closed-off, claustrophobic, and stuffy world that Anna lives within, one filled mostly with just Anna and her memories and her active mind...and her movies. She has a few visitors that come by and she has an online presence that keeps her somewhat connected to the outside world, but other than that it's just Anna. This over 400 page story takes place over less than a month but, for me, each page felt needed to build Anna's backstory and show her progression through sickness. I think in order to fully make this understood the story had to move along as it does...somewhat muted in the beginning and continuously building until the vicious and exhilarating end.

 I can't say much else without giving the story away, but I will say that I loved how the story unfolded much like one of Anna's favorite movies, making this almost an homage to those classic, twisty thrillers. I have to admit that I had one key twist figured out pretty early on, but there were still plenty of turns that I didn't see coming. I also love that, even with all of Anna's bad habits and illogical actions, I came to care about her and worry about where her story would end up. I'm not about to say what happens, so you'll have to read the story to find out!

The Woman in the Window is an excellent thriller and I can see why it's getting so much positive hype. Between this and a few other thrillers I've read lately, any others coming up on my list have quite a bit to live up to!",1517788800,5
6586,377,1673,Its very rare a romance will make me cry but the relationship in this one was just so good! I got sucked into the characters lives and I cared so much about their problems.

6587,120,1834,"Her legal name is now Margaret, Lady Compton, but she still calls herself Maisie Dobbs. Having grown up in the London working-class neighborhood of Lambeth, Maisie is uncomfortable with the title. Widowed shortly after her marriage to the wealthy Lord James Compton, she has been abroad. She is fearful of returning to England, where unnerving memories await her.

It's now April 1937, and Maisie has alighted in Gibraltar. It's ""a place seething with those dispossessed by war across the border."" The Spanish Civil War is raging.

For years before leaving England in 1933, Maisie had operated as a ""psychologist and investigator."" When she stumbles across a dead body shortly after arriving in Gibraltar, she's unable to resist investigating the death. The police insist the victim, a local photographer who was a Sephardic Jew, had been murdered by a vagrant. Maisie is convinced otherwise. Her conviction, and her compulsion to act, lead her into a tangled mystery involving arms smugglers aiding the Republican forces in Spain's civil war. The investigation takes her onto the front lines in Madrid, where the loyalist Republicans are valiantly resisting Francisco Franco's Fascist legions. As the action unfolds, the German and Italian destruction of Guernica takes place.

I've read and enjoyed the ten previous novels in Jacqueline Winspear's Maisie Dobbs series. I found A Dangerous Place less enjoyable because I had difficulty understanding Maisie's thinking and the motivation of several other characters in the story. Why did she insist on investigating that murder? Why is the British secret service following her so closely? (Her father-in-law's interest is unconvincing.) Who was the mysterious blond man who appeared in one of the photographer's photos? Winspear's answers to these questions weren't satisfying.",1517788800,3

His best friend, in shock but physically unharmed, will not talk to anyone.  The witness is sketchy on the details, but says that an argument was plainly heard.  With very few clues and many uncooperative involved individuals, will Jim be able to determine whether a crime has been committed?  When the media picks up on the fact that the boys are of different races, will the court of public opinion put a very real target on the case as a whole?

Odd Child Out was a good read, but it was very slow to start.  The author spent too much time building the identities of the main characters and not enough time on the plot, leaving the book feeling a little unbalanced.  I do like how the police are portrayed, as impartial agents of the law, since many books lately view law enforcement as incompetent or ignorant.  The plot was a little transparent, as I guessed the main twist early on in the story.  Odd Child Out is well written and should appeal to readers who like mystery and suspense.",1517788800,4

The book is very sly.  You won't like the majority of the characters.  Usually, I need characters to root for.  In this case, I really didn't have any - but I was so into the book that it didn't matter.

Cassara has written a novel ostensibly about club kids in 1980 Harlem but all of these kids are so special not just because they are transgender but also because of how they walk through the world.  This was a tough time for the community and Cassara doesn't pull his punches.  This is an emotional, heartfelt love story for the city, the scene, but most of all these people.  If you don't remember (or weren't alive) the time, some of this will seem odd but that's a measure of how far we've all come in our understanding and our daily relations (also our medicine.).

Jack hit me personally in an often-avoided spot in my heart that has struggled with his same deep-dark secret and coped in such similar ways. When consent is presented in literature shame, guilt, disgust, and fear of the opposite sex all seem to make an appearance, but it is rare to see someone explore the other side of the coin: sex must be all I am good for.

6599,464,1836,"Told in four alternating points of view, the story covers a period of approximately 18 months in the secret town of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. A government-built community focused on the enrichment of Uranium for use in bombs to be constructed in Los Alamos.  Secrecy and isolation were the watchwords of this project, and we get a sense of what may have been their thoughts.  Cici, an uneducated country girl with a mean streak, determination to marry rich and a determination to run over anyone who dared stand in her way. June, a young girl from the local area, following in her sisters footsteps, with an insatiable curiosity and enjoyment in all of the worlds being opened to her. Joe, a sharecropper from Alabama who left his wife and children behind with hopes for a better life, more money and opportunity. Lastly Sam, a physicist with promise, recruited for that promise to work in the laboratories.  Each person is wholly different with differing levels of self-awareness and the end game for the project.

A segregated town that was growing up by leaps and bounds: Joes story takes us through the hazards of a black man navigating the discrimination, continuing to work and ignore the many temptations (moonshine, cards, dice) while reining in the anger and determination of some to claim a double victory  (victory in Germany, democracy at home) for those who would wait an additional two plus decades.  Joes story brought the inequities and potential dangers for those who worked tirelessly with sub-par food, housing and opportunity: while building the complex.

Cici was a tangential character: first introducing June to the wonders of Oak Hill  cafeterias, movie theatre, dances, bowling alleys, until her true nature started to show. Threatening a roommate in the dormitory, stringing many men along on her search for the one rich enough to capture her and provide the living she dreamed of, even as she first groomed, then tried to destroy June.

Junes story is the most consistent and complete of the four: a near constant presence her curiosity about the purpose of her work, her genuine enjoyment of the newness of the world she had entered, and her enjoyment of the newness of her relationship with Sam: the ability to discuss her fears, her concerns and ask questions and learn from him.  Even her attempts to lighten Sams load and keep his depression and drinking to a minimum were done selflessly. Her rise from simple dial monitor to secretary for Sam in the laboratories, her abilities to overcome her basic start and move forward, learning more about people, herself and the purpose of Oak Ridge.

Lastly is Sam: a physicist and a Jew, hes one who loves the science and the progress that this project has brought, while still struggling with his place and progress in building a bomb that, while it ends a war, will wreak untold havoc and suffering.  An intellectual snob, with a decided lack of interpersonal skills: he hates everything about Tennessee; weather, accents, mud, locals, segregation and above all the overwhelming secrecy- where nothing is plain spoken.  Hes trying to align his own personal hates (which make him a rather disagreeable person) with the work he loves, but downtime is a trial. When his relationship with Jane starts  hes changing, slightly, with a new purpose  educate and guide this ignorant young girl to the world.  Oh  he alternated between arrogant and needy, with a good dose of self-righteous acting out.

What Beard has created is a story of what could have been, none of these characters are real people, simple amalgams of the many who worked on the project. Bits of interest were often left to feel almost like a footnote, as often the story felt as if it wanted to go in another direction and would suddenly move to a differing point of view.  The difficulties of life for everyone were touched on: the lines, the dust, the heat, the strain of secrets: and the huge celebrations at both VE and VJ days, the endless sameness of each day for the people, and even the tension that I expected to find with the secrecy were missing for most of the story. Yes, each character provided a bit of emotional reaction from me, yet there were moments where I expected more development of a situation, circumstance or revelation.  Not a bad story by any stretch of the imagination, but the multiple points of view muddled everyones individual story, none truly concluded or settled until the epilogue for each of them.  While I think the attempt was to give a nuanced and interconnected story that brought forth the changes, growth and progress for each character in a way that integrated personal and professional lives, there was a piece missing that failed to bring everything together in a way that I believe was expected.

6600,275,1836,"The Atomic City Girls by Janet Beard is an absolutely fascinating novel about four disparate people who work at the atomic research lab in Oak Ridge, TN during World War II.

Eighteen year old June Walker is a farm girl whose future husband is killed not long after he enlists in WW II. Leaving her family and small town behind, she goes to the super secret military reservation in the newly created Oak Ridge, TN which, coincidentally, is built on land her grandfather and his neighbors were forced to sell to the Army. After filling out reams of paperwork, she is assigned to a boring job adjusting knobs for a project she knows nothing about.

Junes roommate, Cici Roberts, is a beautiful yet shallow young woman who is popular with the men but not very well liked by women other than June. Cici is a fun-loving, good-time girl who has a very selfish reason for accepting a job in Oak Ridge. While the two women are initially rather good friends, they eventually fall out over Junes boyfriend, Dr. Sam Cantor.

Originally excited to leave academia for a job at the lab, Sams enthusiasm soon wanes once he fully comprehends the magnitude of the  work he is doing. He is rather morose and drinks to excess to deal with his conflicted feelings. He works in the same building as June and their chance meeting at a New Years Eve party is the beginning of their unlikely romance.

Joe Brewer left his wife and three children behind in Alabama when he took the job as a construction worker at Oak Ridge. The negro workers are not allowed to live with their spouses and Joe misses his family desperately. He is also growing quite concerned over his friend Ralphs friendships with other activists who are working to improve condition for the negro workers.

With the war in Europe finally winding down, the race to develop a bomb before the Germans loses its urgency but work still continues at Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, NM. The project remains shrouded in secrecy although Sam has confided in June the exact nature of their research. The various situations for June, Sam, Cici and Joe quickly come to a head as the US continues fighting the Japanese and the scientists research finally culminates in success. Cici is disgusted by Junes romance with the much older, Jewish scientist and their friendship suffers as a consequence. Joe is increasingly worried about Ralph as racial tensions increase. As Sam becomes more despondent and his drinking escalates, his relationship with June continues to deteriorate.

The Atomic City Girls is an educational exploration of a mostly unknown piece of American history.  The characters are well-developed and add vital insight to the events that are unfolding. Although Los Alamos is famous for its part in the building of the atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oak Ridge, TNs role is not well publicized.  Janet Beards meticulous research brings this little known but immensely interesting portion of history vibrantly to life. This all around riveting read also includes a lovely epilogue so readers know what happens to the various characters long after their lives intersect in Oak Ridge.

6602,1068,596,"Books were safer than other people anyway.

So, what can I say about a book that was just......AMAZING IN EVERY WAY?

Let me just say that I loved magical realism before I knew what magical realism was. This isn't my first romp in Gaiman-land but I have only read Coraline otherwise so...basically now I am buying every one of his other books.

Contrary to other opinions, this book was not confusing to me at all. It's true to Neil Gaiman's staple which is making you feel uneasy yet oddly safe because you know that good will prevail. It's about good vs evil, the end of innocence and friendship and bravery and loss.

And this tidbit of truth: Peas baffled me. I could not understand why grown-ups would take things that tasted so good raw, and then put them in tins, and make them revolting.

 This book is weird and beautiful and everything you want in a weird and beautiful book. At under 200 pages, I truly even want it to end. I read the thing in one day. *insert sad face*

I don't want to give anything away. I'd like people to go in blind like I did and be pleasantly.
surprised.

If you don't Neil Gaiman, you probably won't like this. If you do, read this. If you aren't sure, read this.

6603,810,1837,"How in the world did I manage to miss this series until it was up to the twentieth book in the series?  I thoroughly enjoyed my visit with our damaged WWI hero. It is two years after the war is over and hes still struggling with his shell shock and has to constantly fight to stay in control. You have to admire him for his valiant fight and his way of dealing with his issues. Im not sure how Hamish was explained in earlier books, so my explanation probably isn't a good one  but  I think Hamish is Ians way of dealing with the shell shock. Ian carries on a constant dialogue with Hamish  in his head  and Hamishs comments often save Ian from injury. It wouldnt take much, even two years later, to push Ian over the edge.

I love mysteries, but usually only like them long-term if there is a romance involved, so Im not sure if it is a series Id stick with for very long. The series is twenty books in, and there is no love interest and doesnt appear to be headed in that direction. This book also made me sad because the victims were genuinely nice people whose lives were cut short.

The writers descriptions of the time and people just transports you to that era  lovely cottages still heated with wood fires, motor cars that had to be hand cranked, telephones were almost non-existent, ladies wearing lovely feathered hats  just a gentler time in a country that had been devastated by war.

Ian Rutledges much-adored sister has just married and Ian is having a bit of a panic attack, so he flees London. No destination in mind  just mindless driving  somewhat lost and reliving scenes from the war  he ends up much farther afield than he had intended. He doesnt actually even know where he is and then he spots a car stopped in the middle of the road and a woman, covered in blood, standing over the lifeless body of a man.

Knowing that he cant face returning to London at the moment, he finagles around to take over the investigation. As he learns more and more about the young man who has died, Ian comes to like and respect him and cant imagine that hed have an enemy in the world. He was a very nice, generous and caring young man  who in the world could have wanted him dead. As he investigates, he finds some intriguing clues, but cant find anything to which they actually relate.

Then  a few days later  a second murder committed in the same way and with the same intriguing clues left behind. Again, the victim is a war hero, widower, nice, generous and not an enemy in the world. Again, as Ian investigates and gets to know the man, he comes to like and respect him.

As the investigation continues there is no link that Ian can find between the two men  yet they had the same enemy. Then  Ian hears of another death, assigned to another investigator, that sounds the same as Ians case.

Ian does good solid police work and continues to investigate until he has all the answers. You won't like some of those answers, but Id say that it is probably a very true-to-life investigation and case. The writing is excellent, the plot well laid out, the pacing was good and you come to like and be invested in the characters.

I recommend the book.

6604,248,1837,"You'll be perfectly fine if you haven't read the earlier books in this fine series. Rutledge is a WWI vet with PTSD; you'll find him the most sympathetic of characters. Here he has stumbled upon (or more accurately driven upon) a murdered man. Who was Stephen Wentworth, really? Is he a decent man? Why was he essentially executed? Well, there's a creepy village and lots of secrets. AND then, another man is killed in the same way and then another and, well... Rutledge finds he's got something quite different on his hands than he originally thought. There are terrific characters in what is essentially. procedural, not only Rutledge but also Hamish (he's particularly special) , and Melinda Crawford (related to Bess, who leads another Todd series.). The setting, both physical and the time period, resonates. I haven't read all of the books but this one reminded me how much I enjoy the writing of this pair.

6605,864,1836,"I knew about the Manhattan Project and the goings on in the desert of New Mexico. Or at least what was taught to us in school and what I later read about in books. Who knows what really went on? What went on in Oak Ridge, Tennessee? Clueless. I will note that I am not a real student of American history  I have always been far more interested in the times that happened much earlier than the founding of this country. That being written, there are the tales like this one that open my eyes to our history and make me want to learn more.

The Atomic City Girls is a number of stories really; its a tale of patriotism, a tale of government overreach, a love story, and most of all a story of its time. I don't suppose any of us living in the connected world we currently inhabit could begin to understand the fear and worry of the people living during World War II when news was not as available.

There is the tale of June, a young woman from the area who goes to work in Oak Ridge not fully understanding initially what she is doing there but knowing that the money is better than any other job available. Joe is a Negro family man who came to the complex to better his situation but the black men could not bring their families and live together. And they are paid at half the rate of the white men  but he is still encouraged because he will be able to put money aside for the first time. Finally there is Cici, all class and breeding  or is she. She claims to be there because she wants to support her country but her motives are less than pure.

There were a couple of additional side plots involving characters in the orbits of the three main story lines. Ms. Beard does a good job of weaving all of her ancillary characters but a few bits do get dropped leaving some unanswered questions. Some significant events happen off site as it were and are simply relayed in a couple of sentences which leaves the reader a bit deflated. The book also ended a bit rapidly for me  I would have liked a bit more of the post WWII life. Not chapters and chapters but maybe a few more pages.

Overall though, I did enjoy the book despite these minor complaints. I found myself quite involved in the story  especially Junes. It has made me want to learn more about what went on in Oak Ridge.

If anything, the protagonist is both too lucky and too clever, but not by enough to seem unrealistic.

It reminded me of Zhivago in the way people simply vanished into the mists of Stalinist Russia.  They are important characters, but vanish based on choice and the times. The maintenance of standards, of saving the world through small, contained actions:  that is the world of the Count.  Memory mice with a very full life.

The characters were interesting and fun. Saidi is a dominant personality and it shined through the book. I liked that Jackson was alpha, but not domineering.

One thing that kept me from totally loving this book was that I hadnt read book 1. That wouldve helped to know the other characters better.

The touch of mystery added a lot to this story. I had to know what would happen next. The sexy scenes sizzled and Im glad I read them.

The mystery was well-paced, kept the tension high, and held my interest. I also liked that there were other surprising reveals along the way, some that related to the main crime, and others that didnt. All the storylines were handled competently and wrapped up nicely, and this novel dealt with a wide range of issues that affect adults and teens alike  single parenting, past trauma, grief, teen bullying, isolation and social ostracization, and how easily the spread of social media can ruin lives.

6611,571,819,"The Woman in the Window is a book that I'm on the fence about. The writing is good, the storyline is, for the most part, both interesting and engaging. However, the book lacks surprises and suspense. And, the twists to the story is easy to foresee.

Yet, I found myself quite liking the book. It could be that the book reminded me of Rear Window with James Stewart, or the main characters love for old movies that charmed me since I adore old classic Hollywood movies. The biggest problem, however, is the use of a main character that is unstable, thanks to mental issues because of a past trauma (that was easy to figure out) and the combination of drugs and alcohol. I've come across too many unstable characters on books lately that I've started to avoid psychological thrillers with even the mentioning of characters with mental issues or in any.

The writing is good, the story, however, lacks the necessary twist to truly engage and the ending was too obvious. Although part of me enjoyed the last confrontation. I can actually see how this book would make a great movie. I just wish the story had been more surprising.",1517875200,3
6612,120,819,"The device of theunreliable narratorhas been in use since the earliest days of literature, beginning with the ancient Greeks. Modern authors including Edgar Rice Poe, William Makepeace Thackeray, Agatha Christie, and Vladimir Nabokov have famously used the device for dramatic effect. Much more recently, the unreliable narrator has vaulted onto American bestseller lists with such books as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, Paula Hawkins' The Woman on the Train, and Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace. Among the most recent imitators is the pseudonymous A. J. Finn with his #1 New York Times Bestseller The Woman in the Window.

Though the novel is the author's first book, it could hardly have attracted more favorable reviews. Stephen King, Gillian Flynn, and the New York Times raved about it. And the Washington Post called it ""a beautifully written, brilliantly plotted, richly enjoyable tale of love, loss and madness."" But I wouldn't go that far. It's well written, all right. And the plotting is extraordinarily clever. But I found the two principal revelations in the book entirely predictable, and I had difficulty understanding the narrator's actions from time to time. It just didn't seem to me she could possibly be so stupid at times.

The Woman in the Windowis narrated by Anna Fox, a Ph. D. child psychologist who lives in an upscale, five-story townhouse in Harlem. Anna is agoraphobic and a drunk. (The term ""alcoholic"" just doesn't get the point across.) Her only human contact is with the physical therapist who visits once a week, the handyman who lives in the basement, and the psychotherapist who has prescribed a battery of heavy-duty psychoactive medications. Sometimes Anna forgets to take the drugs. Other times she doubles up the dosage, always washing them down with the merlot she consumes by the case. She spends most of her time spying on the neighbors through her windows, using a telescopic lens on a Nikon to follow their comings and goings.

New neighbors have just moved into the house across the parka husband and wife and their teenage son. (""The deed of sale posted yesterday. My new neighbors are Alistair and Jane Russell; they paid $3.45 million for their humble abode."") As usual, Anna tracks their movements through her camera and checks them out online. Soon after they arrive, she witnesses Jane Russell stagger toward a window, something silver sticking out of her chest with blood all around it. Should you be surprised that when she attempts to report the crime, nobody believes her? Don't be. That's the point of the story.

A. J. Finn is the pen name of Daniel Mallory, who left his post as executive editor at the publisher William Morrow to take up full-time writing after his own company unwittingly bought the rights to The Woman in the Window from his agent.",1517875200,4

6614,571,132,"The Alice Network is a book that many of my bookish friends have read and loved and yet it took ages for me to get to it. Perhaps it was just the right time for it when I finally got to it. Sitting here trying to write a review of the book feels a bit daunting, to be honest. The blurb explains the story quite excellently without giving away to much and I don't want to spoil the story a bit.

So, I will start off by praising the authors writing. This is the first Kate Quinn book I have read and I was impressed with the wonderful flow of the story, how the two storylines so effortlessly fitted together. There is always the risk of one storyline dominated the other, but in this case, I think both were equally good. The women that worked as spies in WW1 really amazed me, their bravery, despite the danger. And the risk they took. Truly amazing! Here I also must say that I just I love how Quinn blended true events with fiction. As always when it comes to author's notes was I fascinated to learn more about true events.

Likewise, was I taken with Charlie's haunt for her cousin in France after WW2. And the connection between the storylines, or rather the connected person; Eve Gardiner is such a wonderful character, from her youthful spies day to the older, quite bitter version.

The Alice Network is a fabulous book and I'm quite eager to read more from Kate Quinn. I recommend this book warmly!",1517875200,4
6615,1030,225,"But not for the reason you'd think. I know a lot of people found this book dull compared to the first, but I finished it rather fast. Or rather, almost finished it. But I'll get to that in a minute.

Things I liked: This book picked up directly where the last left off and the characters are thrown into conflict again. And it doesn't stop. The world and writing are still equal to the last book, as are the characters and interactions. The political and world conflicts have been taken to a new level, adding more layers, and complicating sides and beliefs even further. The villains are just as despicable, maybe a little more so. More magic abilities are discovered to add to excitement.

What I didn't like: Once again the point of people not being born good or evil but it being all about choice is driven. The main character's actions and thoughts become a little more questionable than they once were. And now for the big writing sin Victoria Aveyard committed. I could have liked this book a lot if not for this. I would have given it another star or two even. But sadly, that's not happening. A character dies at the end of this book without any real reason. I thought MAYBE o could guess why and turned to the end to see if the action I suspected would be driven by the death occurred, but it didn't. It was accomplished another way. Therefore the death served no purpose other than to anger me, the reader, cause Mare to turn it into a horrid weapon against herself and cause grief to the rest of the group. As if the characters have not suffered enough, as if Mare's world has not been crumbled enough. This was sadly a poor example of writing which confused me because I thought the author had done a good job up to that point. You don't kill a character simply to just cause pain.

Peeking into the next book - as I bought the first three at once - I am still angered because it further drives the point of this death being used as a torture device. I don't think there's much hope for redemption for this series after that mistake. Sad really because I could have loved it.",1517875200,3

I actually got a different cover hardback of this book through one of my book subscription boxes. I'm going to get this one from Amazon as well because I love the cover and the book!

This book through me for a loop. At first I didn't think I was going to like it. It reminded me of that move, 'In Time.' I think that was the name. But the people in this book give their time in blood. Yes, ewwww.

Jules is the main characters and she's trying to get close to the queen because of some things that happen and the queen is evil. She ends up making friends with some of the ladies at the court. She's also re-introduced to Prince Roan and Prince Liam whom she knew as a little girl.

Things are not all grand in this world and Jules with the help of one person have to find out what it's going to take to stop the evilness.

6618,134,1838,"I am broken, I am treacherous, I am divided

Its so good to read fantasy again. It honestly feels like forever since Ive read a high fantasy novel and Im so happy being back in this magically captivating genre. The Queens Rising really hooked me from the start and took me on a fantastical journey of family, strength, and passion. It was just so good.

Things I Liked
MAPS! And lineages and lots of fun things at the beginning of the book! Maps are something that makes every fantasy story better, and you get 2 in this book/ Plus a whole lot of other cool stuff about characters and family trees. Though be advised you could spoil yourself for some revelations that happen later in the book.

I was a big fan of the writing throughout the story. It was so descriptive and lush. I felt like I was there - interacting with what the characters were seeing. It was so easy to invest in. I also really liked how the story was divided into parts. In some books, I find the division arbitrary, but here each part was contained and built toward a larger goal.

I thought the worldbuilding was great. I loved seeing how Maevana and Valenia are different culturally, and how they value different things. They had their own political systems in place. I loved the matriarchal history in Maevana and the respect for physical strength. I LOVED the House systems and the regard for the different Passions in Valenia. I also liked the history of magic and its legacy in Maevana.

I loved the sisterhood and love that was clearly evident between all the girls studying at Magnalia House. Their friendships were so pure and earnest and I loved seeing it here.

I really enjoyed seeing Brienna searching and experiencing both sides of herself. She wanted to learn about her history and her family legacy, but she wouldnt let that define her future.

Things I Didnt Like
I felt like some things were a little too easy and lacked the tension I wanted in the story. It only happened a few times, but I would have loved for the heighten stakes to feel more impactful.

This story left me feeling so hopeful and proud. I just feel at peace, like this is the story I needed right now, and it was a great one. I loved so many things about it from the characters to the worldbuilding to the personal connections. The Queens Rising has a lot to offer and leaves you completely satisfied.

6619,381,1838,"I won't tell you about the ending, I never spoil my readers, but I do want to say that this is a standalone book. And for that I am very grateful. Brienna is fiery. I want more heroines like Brienna who care about their female friends, who have trouble finding their way, and who are challenged. Brienna feels conflicted by her dual nationality identity. I really enjoyed that this was a facet of the story.

I wish the story did a little more. The parts I enjoyed the most were the ending were the things are unfolding and becoming more complex. And then it ends. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the ending, I just wish there was a little more! I enjoyed the whole idea of the 'passions' but it ultimately felt a little extra to me. It felt like they were how Brienna grows up, and features in the plot, but a minor piece of the main show.

I would recommend The Queen's Rising mostly because I think it was an entertaining read for it's plotline, even though it had a few quirks.

6620,1068,1838,"At 50% completed, this book still hadn't hooked me and I felt as though I was just skimming, anxiously waiting for SOMETHING to happen. I mean, I would take anything at that point.

I just came off reading a highly descriptive novel so maybe I was expecting a little bit more from this one if not the same. There wasn't any world building. Not only that, I didn't know how to picture Brianne where she was at any given time. I let my brain fill in the blanks which is fine in most cases, but don't let me fill in ALL THE BLANKS.

So, we're following Brianne who is accepted into Magnalia House, a school in which you learn different passions to basically fit in society. So, kind of a Divergent feel, but not as good. She gets accepted, despite having no real talent, which was the first strike for me. I mean, this book wants to be mystery, but we all know everyone knows who and what Brianna is from the very start. Maybe I'm just smart like that.

Probably not.

Hey, I've spelled her name wrong twice now. Now you see how unaffected this book made me.

Another thing I couldn't get past was the relationship between this seventeen year-old girl, Brienna and one of her teachers. I'm not a prude, don't get me wrong, but this was a little jarring for me.

The writing was fine. The plot needed a little bit of ooomph. The people and the places needed to shine a little brighter. Everything seemed so grey. Maybe it's because I didn't know what time of day or what the season was or anything.

All in all the book was fine. If there's a sequel, though, I probably won't pick it up.

6621,275,1839,"The fourteenth installment in the Jack Swyteck series, A Death in Live Oak by James Grippando is a timely mystery about the apparent lynching of an African American student at a Gainesville University.

The shocking discovery of Jamal Cousins corpse is eerily reminiscent of the rumored lynching of young teenager Willie James Howard 74 years earlier. One week prior to his death, Jamal, the president of the revered Alpha Fraternity, received racially charged, threatening texts from three members of the Theta Fraternity. Since Jamal only saved the text from Theta president Mark Towson, State Attorney Oliver Boalt and lead detective Josh Proctor quickly zero in on him as their main suspect. Fearing his son will be charged, Marks father requests a favor from his old boss, former FL Governor Harry Swyteck to ask his son, Jack, to consider representing Mark.

Tensions run high and the university is forced to quickly act. Mark is expelled from college and the future of the Theta fraternity is uncertain. Marks efforts to overturn his expulsion backfire when Jamals friend Brandon Wall gives damning testimony that point to racism within the fraternity. Racial tensions on campus turn violent when white supremacists begin attacking African American protesters at demonstrations.

With Boalt under extreme pressure to ensure Jamal receives swift justice, he relies on sworn statements from Marks frat brother and friend Baine Robinson to bolster his somewhat thin case. Jack is quite skeptical of Baines efforts to cast suspicion on his friend, but Boalt quickly convenes a grand jury and Mark is summarily indicted then arrested for Jamals murder. Jack is extremely worried about his clients safety after he is incarcerated pending trial. Forced into a hearing to procure bail for Mark, will Jack uncover the truth about who murdered Jamal?

At the same time Jack is immersed in the volatile case, his wife, FBI agent Andie Hennings current assignment rapidly progresses. Working undercover, she is a very capable agent but the people she is investigating are extremely dangerous. Despite her best efforts to remain out of harms way, when her path crosses with someone connected to Jamals murder investigation, things quickly take a perilous turn.

A brilliant addition to the Jack Swyteck series, A Death in Live Oak is a riveting mystery that is socially relevant. The storyline moves at a brisk pace and readers will have a difficult time figuring out who killed Jamal and why. Loosely based on the real life lynching of Willie James Howard, James Grippando shines a much needed light on the racial injustices of the past and the racism that continues to plague our society today.

6622,644,1838,"The Queen's Rising was just another run-of-the-mill YA Fantasy that didn't stand out among other books in the genre. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. It had some interesting ideas but overall there was nothing that really surprised me. The pacing was a little slow for the first two thirds of the book, the story only got interesting at about 70%. I am afraid that in a few weeks I won't remember what the book is about.

The one thing that I really appreciated was the way female friendships were portrayed. Brienna had a very close, supportive, and loving relationship with all other girls in Magnalia school. There was no backstabbing, jealousy, or ""I am better than other girls"" attitude. She loved her friends and her friends loved her.

I wanted to love The Queen's Rising and even though there were some parts that I enjoyed, in the end I was left unsatisfied.

6623,1030,334,"Got these books on a whim because the covers kept catching my eye and I am partial to books with ""magic"" elements.

Things I liked: I'll start off by saying the author writes well. From the style, to the characters it's nicely done. The world could have used maybe a few touch ups but it is in no way sloppily done. The powers/abilities are interesting and decently put together. The character dynamics are excellently constructed. Everyone has their own reasons/motives for their actions towards another individual and no one really has the same goal for the same reason. The villains are perfectly hateful, so well done there. There was a plot twist that I COULD have suspected had it not been for the way the author weaves the conflicts and you're not sure who to believe.

Things I didn't care for: The plot and entire story is very dark, so it isn't a happy read. Mare herself isn't exactly a good character, considering she's a thief and not a bad liar. The idea is that circumstances make a person evil and they just need to ""choose to be good"". One character could have used a bit more development and depth, but the others are so well done I'm not complaining much.

All in all a good start to the series.",1517875200,4
6624,307,59,"This book is too much.  There were 2 stories in one book with a vague connection.  The second part was not needed, superfluous, and boring.
A town character and house keeper for Sir Magnus at Pye Hall has accidentally fallen to her death.  Shortly after this Sir Magnus is murdered. The famous literary detective Atticus Pund has come to town and become interested in the details. He finds that Sir Pye was generally disliked and also has a history with everybody.  Many villagers could have been involved with his demise.  About the time we get into this plot we switch to a secondary story.  There is a huge amount of filler in the book.  There are letters, reports, diary info. and numerous other useless sources of information.  Why, why, why do detective stories have to get so convoluted?",1517875200,3

6637,148,248,"It was a lazy week in the sleepy suburbs of a West African capital, and I was bored, attending as I had been a conference on something or something else. The lulling drones of the presenters hyphenated by breaks  Africans do love their breaks, after all. Coffee and lunch and snack; networking over piles of buffet rice and plantains. But I have never been very social  and wandering through the decaying lobby of the bedraggled hotel I stumbled upon a bookshelf with the odd assortment of books you are won't to find on bookshelves in dilapidated hotels in the third world. I started thumbing through them until I ran into Dickens. Specifically, a Christmas Carol. Now, I like Dickens, so I picked up the little book; realizing as I did in a flash of embarrassment that I had never actually read that story. Oh, I knew it of course by heart  it has been retold so often, the epicenter of our Christmas traditions  how could I not? I sat down, sun pouring through dust I had kicked up as I began to turn the pages.

Now I like Dickens, as I like many Victorian British novelists. I guess I was curious to see if the movies had stayed true to the little novel. I guess I wanted to say that I, to, had read it. But as I began to get engaged in the story, my motivation changed and I read because I wanted to read it. Thats what a good book does  so many books, especially classics, we read because we know we should  because we who are authors know it will improve out craft  because we believe that through the old books that are still read long after their creators are gone is transmitted wisdom we need in a world of frivolity and foolishness. This I expected; but to be entrapped in story, that was a pleasant surprise.

You all know the plot, so I won't bother going over it. But I will tell you what it means; which is not what most people think it means. It is not a tale of money, nor is it really a story of greed. Perhaps that is because greed is not what people want us to believe it is; in fact, the word greed has become so charged that any debate regarding it is immediately poisoned. Scrooge was selfish, people say. He was greedy, they go on, because he loved money more than people; and we all know that money is evil. Oh, Im not defending greed. Im defending money.

Money is evil, everybody says all the time, the perfect excuse for those of a certain political persuasion to nab some of yours to do with as they think you should, but almost never do themselves. But is it? Money is, after all, very simply a tool  a store of value and a unit of measure. Ayn Rand writes (yes, Im getting immense mirth at quoting her here, sure as I am that you believe her to be Scrooge incarnate), Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. We don't know what Scrooge did to get rich, but he didn't steal his wealth so obviously he was offering somebody value, and was therefore rewarded.

So why the story? Why was Scrooge so unhappy; and why has that despondency led him to become the poster-child for the evil of wealth? Charles Dickens calls him a miser. According to Dictionary.com a miser is, a person who lives in wretched circumstances in order to save and hoard money. Therein lies Scrooges problem  not that he had the money; but that in its frenetic accumulation he lost the plot, making himself miserable (the root of that very word being miser). He forgot that money was a tool to facilitate obtaining voluntarily that which he valued. No, the money did not make him miserable; it was his miserliness that did not allow him to employ his money in the pursuit of the things which had value for him; family, charity, respect, stature  happiness. That is what this story is about. It is a story about value.

So let me ask you, dear reader  what is it that you value? And do you pursue it? Or are you instead miserly, with your time, your attention, your discipline, your love, your poverty and  yes  even your money? That is the lesson of Mr. Dickens short Christmas story.",1517875200,4

Coming back to forty years later, I can agree that it's great, but there's so much more here.

The most special part of Zora Neale Hurston's writing is that she takes subjects that society wants to segment into ""good"" or ""bad"" and makes them human -- thereby making them complicated. Subjects like infidelity, domestic abuse, killing for self-protection, killing as an act of mercy, colorism, white savior complex, poverty, female pride, female submission, moral relativism... You name a tough topic, and Hurston handles it in this book with a deft touch rarely found in today's world.

6647,403,1162,"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein has a simple premise.  Unlike classical economic theory, where people are fully rational and always do things in their best interest, we are really lazy, uninformed, and unmotivated.  We make bad decision because we lack information, or space out, or are too stupid to investigate what descisions will make our lives better.

Intuitively, this view appeals to me.  One example: create online retirement forms with a default setting which generally benefit employees, rather than no setting at all.  Most people don't really understand their retirement plans, if they even have one.  So make their laziness work for them.

Of course, the  Libertarian Paternalism proposed in this work is problematic.  Who makes the choices that we get to choose from? Cant ""they"" rig the system for their benefit and not ours?

Despite this, I think the authors view of human nature is sound, and can lead to more intelligent discussions about what we, as a species and individuals in that species, can hope to accomplish.",1517875200,4

6652,352,728,"It has been said that civilization is twenty-four hours and two meals away from barbarism.

This was quirky and a little on the odd side but totally fun. Heaven and Hell have basically been in a cold war for well forever it seems. Ever since Lucifer An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards. became the bad guy the final show down has been in the works. But now, finally Satans son has been born and the prophecies all say that when he is Eleven the end of the world will finally come about.

The humor in this is really incredibly fun and I loved Aziraphale, the Angel who wasn't necessarily all good, and Crowley the demon who really wasn't that bad of a guy. Even more I enjoyed the friendship between them and how they worked both together and against each other.

  Hell wasn't a major reservoir of evil, any more then Heaven, in Crowley's opinion, was a fountain of goodness; they were just sides in the great cosmic chess game. Where you found the real McCoy, the real grace and the real heart-stopping evil, was right inside the human mind.

This had an extensive cast that included the four horsemen (one was a woman) of the apocalypse, a witch or two, some Satanists (they weren't really bad people), a gang of kids, a witchhunter and a dog.

There are a ton of funny little snippets here and there and I really enjoyed the cut and paste together style that had the reader jumping from group of characters to groups of characters as we go through the countdown to the final days.

This is supposed to be a tv series soon and it will be interesting to see how that goes. I think it will be a good time and lets face it at the end of the world you might as well have a good time.

6674,749,594,"When I saw the first trailer for the Annihilation movie several months ago, I immediately added the book to my TBR-ASAP shelf on Goodreads without even reading through the description. I put in a hold at the library, waited patiently, and then devoured the book immediately after checking it out.

Its been a while since a book has hooked me so strongly from the first page, but Annihilation did just that. The writing was just gorgeous, and I was instantly pulled into the world of Area X that VanderMeer had created. From the outset, I didn't want to put it down, but I forced myself to work my way through slowly and to savor every page.

I adored the narrator and loved the style in which the book was written: a journal penned carefully by the biologist, detailing her experiences on the expedition. The readers awareness of Area X, and the events taking place within it, relies completely on what the biologist is willing to share. I loved that she could be a bit of an unreliable narrator, and that she was able to outright admit to intentionally manipulating the reader with what she shared.

If you're the type of reader who wants all of their questions answered, this book isn't for you. There is no omniscient narrator to share the secrets of Area X with us. There is only the biologist and what she knows, or what she thinks she knows.

I can say without a doubt that Annihilation is now one of my all-time favorite books, and will certainly be on my top 10 list at the end of 2018. I cant wait to see what the rest of the Southern Reach trilogy has in store for me.",1517961600,5

After a while of being away from the book and looking back on it, I realized that I actually wasn't a huge fan of it, and was not planning to continue. For one reason or another, I decided to continue, and I am glad I did, because I found myself enjoying this one so much more than the first one. The beginning was slow, and I found it dragging near the end, but I thoroughly enjoyed the middle of the book. I will say though, I was very disappointed when I got to the end and found out that it was going to be continued. Since the first book I have and it in my mind that it was going to be a duology, I didn't hear that it was going to be extended, and throughout this book I was prepared for the end to BE the end. At this point, I think I want to say that I will most likely not pick up the third book, but I said that about this one, so it is up in the air weather or not I will continue.",1517961600,4
6677,2,59,"The entire first half of this novel is an extended Agatha Christie pastiche, wherein a Poirot-like detective investigates some suspicious deaths in a quiet English village. It's very well done, and would be a fun pastoral whodunnit even on its own merits. But as it turns out, this section is actually a novel within a novel, with the final chapters removed. It's the manuscript for a book that hasn't been published yet, and before its editor can locate the missing pages, she finds out the author has turned up dead.

This new mystery of a writer killed to protect secrets hidden in his books feels a little like the J.K. Rowling-as-Robert Galbraith novel The Silkworm, but the inclusion of the full text of the inner story is an excellent postmodern twist. The whole thing is a great love letter to the mystery genre, and an intriguing exploration of the ties between authors and their characters.",1517961600,4

A past where Roman was a English soldier stationed in India, and where Leonie lived in India with her parents and was taking part in the social whirl of the English people living there. Because of difficult events during that time, neither Leonie or Roman have been able to walk away from the disturbing and troublesome memories of those events. Because Roman has inherited a title, and has no money to manage his estate, or to help his people and family; and because Leonie, hasn't found a husband because of the labels that English society has placed on her, they find themselves married. Their marriage is going to force them both to face their pasts, and to face the demons that could overtake their future together.

6682,508,1756,"One of my favorite things about this book was that it really reminded me of the show House of Anubis, which was one of my favorite shows in middle school so that was nice (I'm not even sure if anyone will get that reference, because when I watched it no one knew wtf it was, but it was what I was thinking for a lot of this book).
Something else that I really enjoyed was that there wasn't just one mystery, but two of them. While I usually don't like switching timelines (and at times I was skimming over one so I could get to the other) I didn't hate this one, and flashing back to see what actually happened while people in the present times were speculating about what happened was cool.
As far as what I did not like, there were two things, a small issue and a big issue. The small issue was that even at the end I still didn't have a huge connection with most of the characters. I didn't dislike them, some of them I can even say I liked, but I didn't love them, and at this point I don't feel like any of them are going to leave any last impressions on me. The big things that I didn't like was the ending. When it comes to mysteries, I want basically all of the mystery tied up in the first book, and that's not what happened. There are still many unanswered questions that I need answered, and while I know there is going to be a second book that will hopefully give me some answers I quite honestly don't want to wait that long. By the time the next book comes out I probably won't remember enough of the little details of this book for the reveal to be satisfying, which is why I prefer books with mysteries to either be a standalone, or to be a series where in each book the focus is on a new mystery.
I will definitely pick up the next book in this series, but I really really REALLY wish more questions would have been answered at the end.",1517961600,5

Perhaps, a decade later, were ready for a fictional portrayal of those turbulent times thats actually funny and poignant simultaneously. Thats what Jillian Medoff has delivered in her new novel, THIS COULD HURT.

The book centers on the HR department at Ellery Research, a market research company that, like much of corporate America, has had to shift its priorities and make some tough choices in the wake of the global recession. Set in late 2009 and 2010, THIS COULD HURT portrays a company --- and, more relevantly, its employees --- still very much shaken up and unsure of themselves, waiting for the other shoe to drop in the wake of layoffs and cutbacks.

At the helm of HR is Rosa Guerrero, who has devoted nearly her entire career to human resources and doing her best work for the employees at Ellery Research. She is a competent manager who seems to genuinely care about her employees. Since her husbands recent death, work has come to mean even more to her.

Around Rosa are a group of middle managers --- Lucy Bender, Leo Smalls, Rob Hirsch and Kenny Verville --- all of whom have their own struggles and dilemmas. Lucy, the communications chief, is perhaps not a natural leader but is ambitious and angling to become Rosas deputy. Leo, the benefits manager, is lonely and searching for love (it doesnt help that his ex-boyfriend was on Ellerys IT staff). Rob is tired of recruiting and has started to let his responsibilities slide, perhaps at his own peril. And Kenny, who is successful but whose ambition pales in comparison to that of his Wall Streetbound wife, is certain that Ellery is just a stepping stone to something much more prestigious.

Like most of us, many of the characters, with the possible exception of Rosa, fall somewhere between passionate and apathetic when it comes to their attitudes about work, as they struggle to navigate the intersections of their personal lives with their professional selves. When Rosa experiences a health crisis, the new roles taken on by her staff help to define what she means to them --- and perhaps what they mean to one another.

Near the end of the novel, during a speech at the annual meeting, Rosa shares the greatest lesson she has learned in business: A working life doesnt just keep you solvent, it defines you, shapes your character, reveals what you're made of. Rosa firmly believes this, and even if the rest of her staff might not agree entirely, what happens over the course of the book might just prove that Rosa is right after all.

Divided into sections from each characters point of view, the narrative also includes some whimsical touches, some of which are more successful than others (Lucys section is punctuated by footnotes, for example, and the denouement is told through a series of org charts). Overall, however, THIS COULD HURT is a penetrative novel about how work --- even the work we might resent or despise at times --- forges strange and wonderful relationships and forces difficult choices.

6684,681,1803,"Okay, it's been a while since I last read a Lorraine Heath book, which is kind of crazy I love her books. She tends to be an auto-buy at the story. Then again it's those amazing covers. Anyway, I actually liked Beyond Scandal and Desire, even though it had a slow start. Boy did story start to get interesting when we started to see Mick Trewlove's revenge plan start to play out. I have to say there is a little twist, I didn't see coming towards the end. Lorraine does a pretty good job at adding this little twist.

Alright, in Lorraine's new series we follow the lives at these adults who happen to grow up as bastards. The first up is Mick, the oldest. He also finds out that he's the child of the Duke of Hedley. He grew up without the privilege of his Hedley's other son, all he wants to do is be claimed as a bastard. However, Hedley has no desire, so a plot of revenge ensue. Boy is there a lot of collateral damage, and one of them is Lady Aslyn Hastings. All Mick wants to do is seduce her away from the heir, but we starts to admire Aslyn. We see a problem happening, Mick has to make a decision on what is best: continue on the set course or let it go.

Oh my goodness, I really liked Beyond Scandal and Desire, and the title is so fitting. Lorraine does a pretty good job with this story, and we even see Mick's brothers and sisters. I look forward to the other story, especially Fancy. However, being the youngest we probably won't see who she marries for awhile. However, there are other interesting siblings. Mick and Aslyn is a wonderful story. Yes, you do need to be patient, because it's building to something big. Everything starts to make sense on why Aslyn is so shelter. Overall, it's a beautiful story.

Holy Moly! That ending! I had a little over 100 pages to go when I got in bed to read before falling asleep and I read those 100 pages quicker than I've ever read 100 pages in my life. And then I had to read a light and fluffy book and watch some This is US before actually being able to fall asleep without thinking someone else was in my bedroom (aside from my sleeping husband next to me).

The build up to those last pages was extremely good. All the wine and drugs (medications) really made for one unreliable narrator and the other characters were so dang convincing, I had no idea who to believe. I only got an inkling of the truth in those last pages and then I was so freaked out that it didn't matter that I had figured it out, because it was so much worse than I could have imagined.

I liked the psychology aspect of the book, as I always do. It was definitely new territory for me with the agoraphobia and it was interesting to see how she *dealt* with that and how that played into the whole plot, along with her panic attacks and PTSD. It was an interesting mix of diagnoses and her symptoms were written very well.

I really, really enjoyed this marvelous debut. It was fast-paced, thrilling, and perfectly constructed. I will definitely be looking for what else this author has to offer next.",1517961600,4
6687,711,1843,"Im not sure that THE POPE OF PALM BEACH is Tim Dorseys best book, but its certainly my new favorite in the Serge A. Storms canon. If you're looking to shake off the winter doldrums with a solid, laugh-a-page read with some innovative mayhem applied to deserving parties, this is the novel you want and need.

THE POPE OF PALM BEACH may be the 21st installment, but don't hesitate to jump right in. Dorsey makes it quite easy for newcomers to make the acquaintance of Floridas #1 fan, archivist and vigilante serial killer. With his sidekick, Coleman --- who is totally baked and half-baked at the same time --- he traverses the Sunshine State with purpose and at full speed. In this latest adventure, Serge is returning to his hometown of Riviera Beach, and he and Coleman are on a literary tour of the area, visiting various locations mentioned in Elmore Leonard and Charles Willeford novels.

Serge is also on the hunt for Kenny Reese, his favorite author, who wrote three brilliant works of detective fiction before inexplicably disappearing. However, there are other parties hunting for Reese, and it is inevitable that their paths will cross. The narrative, for a good two-thirds of the book, alternates between Serges present and the 1960s through the 1990s. It is in the sections dealing with the past that we learn a bit about Storms (and Colemans) childhood, as well as the friendship between a surfer god named Darby Pope and a disaffected young man who Pope mentors. That is not all that we learn, of course.

The novel is generously sprinkled with information peculiar to Florida, such as the mean high tide law, the habits of sea turtles, and smuggling, as well as more general topics like writing, book tours, friendship, loyalty, and hazardous waste collection and its disposal. Serge also mentions, ever so briefly, how, during a stint in Catholic grade school, he and his classmates played tackle football on the playground, resulting in their school uniforms being shredded repeatedly. That was all it took to make this my favorite Serge book; I thought that happened only at my school.

THE POPE OF PALM BEACH isn't just laughs and mayhem, although it still would be worth reading if that was the case. Dorsey demonstrates that he can write serious crime and caper fiction without batting an eye. There is even a bit of a novel within a novel that may make you yearn to see a completed version of it. Actually, THE POPE OF PALM BEACH may be the completed version. With Dorsey, you never know. What you should know is that this is a book you should read by an author whose work you should be reading religiously.

What I enjoyed:
The characters. Brienna was really easy to like. I felt her frustration for answers, her anger at injustices and her heartbreak when she felt like all was lost. All the girlsfor the most partwere really supportive of each other. I loved getting to know them and watching their friendships grow.

The world was well done and felt so big. The author really brought the different places to life. I liked learning about the different cultures, history and beliefs of each place.

What I didn't love:
The romance. It was just ehh for me. Not super exciting.

Some things happened a little too easily and other things happened a little too slowly. I would have loved to see some more tension and suspense in those moments.

**START OF SPOILER**
My other big gripe is a SPOILER so read on with caution. I hated that Brienna wasn't the one fighting to be queen. I know, silly, but I kept waiting for that to change and I really wanted it to.
**SPOILER ENDS**

At the end after everything was said and done, I still wanted to read more. It felt complete, but I wanted more so I will defiantly keep a look out for book number two.

6689,756,1510,"When Angela met Jason Powell while catering a dinner party in East Hampton, she assumed their romance would be a short-lived fling, like so many relationships between locals and summer visitors. To her surprise, Jason, a brilliant economics professor at NYU, had other plans, and they married the following summer. For Angela, the marriage turned out to be a chance to reboot her life. She and her son were finally able to move out of her mothers home to Manhattan, where no one knew about her tragic past.

  Six years later, thanks to a bestselling book and a growing media career, Jason has become a cultural lightning rod, placing Angela near the spotlight she worked so carefully to avoid. When a college intern makes an accusation against Jason, and another woman, Kerry Lynch, comes forward with an even more troubling allegation, their perfect life begins to unravel. Jason insists he is innocent, and Angela believes him. But when Kerry disappears, Angela is forced to take a closer lookat both the man she married and the women she chose not to believe.

My Thoughts: Angelas loyalty to Jason, despite the growing evidence against him, fits perfectly with what we know about her background. How could her judgment be anything but impaired after what she has been through?

But what we learned about the supposed victims gave me pause, too.

I loved watching Clara come into her own, both in society and at the newspaper office. Even though their black moment broke my heart more than a little, I couldn't help but cheer for her at the same time. And when Rex finally figures out what his true feelings are? Pure HEA gold.

This edition is twice the pages because every note ever made regarding Fahrenheit 451 is added to the afterward. There are some great bits to be found here, but the best part of the edition is Neal Gaiman's introduction. It helped me understand the treatment and roles of the women in this book, which I may have been far less sympathetic to had I not read and reread Gaiman's words.

Sci-fi first turned me off as a kid in the 1970s. I think this was because most of it contained idiotic women and heroic, if also idiotic, men who always ""won."" I was never a man in 1953, so I'll give the treatment of Mildred a pass (she also is named Mildred, which I think is a message I needed to take a clue from.)

Apparently through the years, generous readings weren't always happening, and Bradbury reacts strongly to the censorship of his story about censorship -- which should shock nobody. A more thoughtful reaction from me shows that Bradbury may have purposefully written the two most important females the way they are as a retort to an increasingly puritanical America in the 1950s. This is not an original thought, but it took me a while to find the nuances and temper my own reactions.

Nope, Ray Bradbury and 1953 can be exactly who they were, and I'll be me. So long as we're all respectful of each other, then no harm/no foul.

Lucian is a man who likes his one night stands and not much else. Not his brothers, that's for sure.

The de Vincent brothers sure are a handful, what the hell is up with Devlin? He gives me the chills but is also mysterious and interesting at the same time, I definitely want a book from his point of view.

Lucian and Julia's banter was funny and entertaining but their chemistry was lacking. The ending and big reveal also left me unsatisfied. That was too convoluted and far fetched for me, it seemed utterly ridiculous. After all the suspense and build-up the reveal was quite disappointing.

I feel like I keep reading YA SFF and just not feeling like there is anything new or unique. I went into The Queens Rising expecting to feel the same, especially amidst all the lower reviews I kept seeing on Goodreads, but this ended up being a treat to read. I really enjoyed this, and I was constantly surprised by the twists and turns. The only negative thing I can say is that the romance is a little on the skeezy side, and Ill talk about that below, but if the romance wasn't in this book, or started differently, this would have been an easy five star read for me.

Bow to no king

In this world there are Houses, which are small boarding schools that specialize in five passions: art, music, dramatics, wit, and knowledge. If you have a natural talent for one of these five categories, you will go away to school once you are ten-years-old and begin your education that will last for seven years. And the unique thing is the House will only admit one child per passion for those seven years, and each child is given their own personal teacher that they will study under for the entire seven years.

And upon graduating, you will be declared a master of your passion and you will be given a very special cape, which you see the main protagonist wearing on the cover of this book. Each different passion has a different color cape that is given. A party/gathering will also be held where people will come from all around the world to offer you patronage to work under them and become almost part of their family. Whether that be touring the country with your music passion cape and a band of other musicians. Or maybe using your knowledge profession to work under a doctor that needs help. There is a vast array of different jobs a graduating passion will be offered.

Our story follows Brienna, a girl who has had the identity of her father hidden from her. After her mothers life was taken much too soon, Brienna has been raised by her grandfather until the age of ten. At ten, Brienna heard her grandfather make a desperate plea to the headmaster/owner of the Magnalia House. Agreeing to help hide Brienna, she is admitted into the House and she chooses the passion of art!

Sadly, Brienna soon realizes that maybe her talents are not aligned with art, so year two she tries something else, and then something else year four, and year five, and finally upon year five she asks for Master Cartier to teach her everything it takes to become a passion in knowledge in only three short years.

And then the story truly takes place at the end of Brienna and her classmates seventh year, where they are all hoping to get the patron of their dreams. Brienna isn't ready to say goodbye to the friends who have been her sisters for the last seven years. Especially Merei, who was her roommate and who studied the passion of music, and who was probably my favorite side character. Seriously, this book highlights the power of friendship between these two girls and I loved every single part of it.

This story also centers around the two countries of Valenia and Maevana that are connected by a channel. Valenia is way more forward thinking, where Maevana is ran by an evil dictator king, even though it is supposed to be governed by a queen. The Magnalia House is in Valenia, but that doesnt mean that many of the girls will have to cross over to Maevana with their patrons.

Brienna ends up going on quite the adventure, that is filled with twists and turns that I honestly didn't see coming. This book seriously shocked me numerous times, and the storylines were just so well crafted! This was such an amazing debut novel and I feel so very honored that I was given an ARC for it.

Okay, lets just get the bad out of the way. The romance in this didn't feel good to read, for me personally. I suppose I will say: this lone paragraph will have very minor spoilers! But honestly, you learn very quickly that a romance is going to bloom between Brienna and her teacher of knowledge, Cartier. Romance is never at the forefront of the book, and is nonexistent for a large majority of it, but it is still sprinkled throughout. Now, once things progress, Brienna is eighteen, but thats not the problem I even had with this romance, it is the fact that this teacher, who Brienna has trusted, and respected, has known since she was ten-freaking-years-old! Like, this has a grooming feeling all over it, and I could never get past it. And I could write this entire review about the power imbalance between these two individuals alone. Also, the professors are referred to as master in this book, and it feels exceptionally bad to read when Brienna kept calling Cartier it. This was my only complaint about this book. If you take this out completely, or pretend that Cartier is just a guy Brienna meets on her journey, then it is a five star book. Sadly, I couldn't ignore it, as hard as I tried, and it was the only negative thing in this story for me.

But I will say this: no matter which path you choose, I will follow you, even unto darkness.

But again, if you ignore the minor romance that is sprinkled throughout, this book is perfection. And the writing? Lord, the writing in this is magical. It made an over 400-page novel seem like 200. I couldn't believe how fast I was turning the pages. I just wanted more and more and more! The writing was so lush and lyrical! And it was the perfect mixture of whimsical, yet still so very bloody.

Another thing I loved about this story was that it really is a love letter to found families. It has a running theme of how unimportant blood truly is, but how the people we choose to love and support mean everything. You guys know that Im all about books with found families, and this one truly celebrated them.

Also, this is the first book in a series, but another thing I really loved about this book is that it totally reads like a standalone. I am 100% completely and utterly satisfied with the conclusion of this book, and even though I cant wait for more, I love that everything felt wrapped up, yet still gives the promise for so much more. Ill take a wonderful ending like this over a cliffhanger any day of the year.

Overall, I loved this and I cant wait to see what is next! This is one of the best debut novels Ive read and is one of the best ARCs Ive read so far in 2018. It was a breath of fresh air among all the other YA fantasy novels that just have not been doing it for me lately. This was wonderful, and I hope you all give it a chance, because the inside of this book is as beautiful as the cover.",1518048000,4
6704,508,1838,"The best way to describe this book is that it is slow. Just by reading the description of this book you know that the book is about Brienna, who did not have the natural talent for any of the five categories for passion, and that leads to her not finding a patron. Months later a patron makes her an offer, and that there are dark secrets that lead to her to find out who her dad is and plots to overthrow the current power and what not. While that description was what intrigued me about this book, we didn't even get to this until past 150 pages. Those 150 pages were basically just world building, and while I appreciate world building, and I thought it was interesting that it was shown by the fact that Brienna was learning all of it herself, after a while it became boring and I kept wondering when the actual plot was going to being. Even when it got to the second part, and things had actually started, it was still slow, and the longer I kept reading, the more I started to loose interest.
  Other than it being slow, I there was also the problem that so much time was spent on things like world building and information about past character, that it took away from learning about the current characters. Not only could I not find myself particularly caring for any of the characters in this book, but the relationships between all of these characters fell flat to me, and when they would care about each other I just could not see it.
  I do have to give this book props because even though I did not love it, when I look back and think about it, I don't have any negative feelings towards it, I can forget how slow it was and just remember the parts of the world building that I did like (which usually does not happen for me, I usually hold onto the things that I don't like and only remember the bad).",1518048000,3

This was a weird read for me. I kept trying to figure out why it was such a slog. I usually love to read about people I love to hate, and almost every character qualifies. I do admire the twisted way Emily Bront told this tale. It's a complex way to get a story out and very smart. While this is clearly brilliant writing, I just didn't fancy it. It's a bit like some Bach -- I can appreciate the technical skill and accomplishment, but I just don't enjoy listening to it.

The evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces and tens of thousands of French troops was a miracle. Hitlers soldiers penned in around 400,000 Allied troops near Dunkirk (Foreword). Over 338,000 men were safely evacuated from the Dunkirk pocket. On May 15, 1940 French Premier Paul Reynaud called the British Prime Minister to tell of the lost battle. The front was broken near Sedan and Germans were pouring through the Ardennes in great numbers using tanks and dive bombers (Chapter 1). These overwhelmed the Allied forces and forced a retreat. The British headed to Dunkirk, the nearest French port.

The Germans used radio to communicate efficiently. The safety of the BEF must come first (p. 24). German tanks losses came from a lack of maintenance (Chapter 2). This caused a three-day delay (p. 33). The BEF needed more destroyers and anything that can cross the Channel (p. 39).Churchill began to think about evacuation (Chapter 3). The Navy listed all possible vessels (p. 46). Shallow draft boats could approach the beaches. British troops would fight to the end at Calais to buy time (Chapter 4). There was confusion on the beach (pp. 81-82). The Germans attacked the rescue ships (Chapter 5). The Navy requisitioned all available boats (p. 89). The Belgians surrendered, opening a gap (p. 99). But some Belgians would not surrender (Chapter 6). Montgomery was sent to defend the gap. SS troops shot prisoners (p. 107). German E-boats torpedoed two destroyers in the dark (Chapter 7). There were other attacks. The RAFs fighters were now active against the Luftwaffe (Chapter 8). But the Stukas kept attacking. Soldiers were rescued from sinking ships. More ships and boats were urgently needed (p. 153).

Many small boats arrived at Dunkirk (Chapter 9). Volunteers would sail them to Dunkirk. Trucks were put into the sea to form a jetty (p. 165). French troops would be evacuated in equal numbers (Chapter 10). The evacuation continued. The perimeter was held against German attacks (Chapter 11). When the signal came they left for the beach. The ships along the shore were attacked (Chapter 12). Some were hit and sunk, trapping men. Stress and sleeplessness began to affect personnel (p. 224). Attacks caused the British to withdraw (Chapter 13). French troops replaced them. Hospital ships were attacked (p..242). The last evacuation was on June 3 (Chapter 14). Some British and many French were left behind, so too the wounded. The Germans arrived on June 4for the French surrender (Chapter 15). Some rescue ships were sunk by mines or collisions (p. 268). Rescued troops were taken to various assembly points, crowds gave them food and drink (p. 271). Calm weather, overhead clouds and rain helped. The Germans called it a victory (p. 273).

This book covers the big picture and has colorful stories to present small details. Dunkirk was a miracle because of the conjunction of various events. It preserved the nucleus of the future British army. Information was gathered from the Written Source Materials. The Acknowledgments and List of Contributors provide references.",1518048000,5
6713,447,1785,"This is the story of a young mans disillusionment and what came after. At the start of the book Silas, a weaver, belongs to a strict Dissenter sect. He soon experiences betrayal and is excommunicated after the casting of lots falsely indict him rather than the truly guilty party. Wondering how God could allow such a thing, Silas moves to the small community of Raveloe (where he is perpetually an outsider) and loses himself in solitude, work, and the stockpiling of gold. But life (Providence? God?) isn't done with Silas, and two major events change the course of his solitary, miserly life.

The town of Raveloe is peopled with interesting characters, though occasionally I found their extended folksy ramblings tedious. The most important group to the story is the local squire, his two rascally older sons, and connected spouses and relatives. I wish that the ugly sister-in-law Priscilla had more screen time as she was quite amusingI suspect George Eliot to have partially based the character on herself.

This is essentially a reclamation story along the lines of a non-supernatural version of Dickens Christmas Carol (Dickens loved it and wrote  her a fan letter). It touches on themes of reaping what you sow and how Gods ways are higher than your ways. Overall, it is a sweet, enjoyable book that is well worth reading.",1518048000,5

6717,1030,741,"I am just going to get straight to the point about what I liked and didn't like about this book. Knowing what it was going to be about I was eager for it in some respects but I was disappointed yet again.

Things I liked: The writing is still very good, and the plot construction, just like the last two books. Maven, the villain, is the kind I love-hate. Twisted and tormented, (partially because of his wicked mother), but you can't excuse what he's done even though you feel sorry. Miss Aveyard is very good at crafting the villains. I was really hoping we would get some chapters from his POV. Maybe we will in ""War Storm."" The 3 new characters she added, the ones with electrical ability interested me for the brief period they were there and I hope there will be more of them later.

Things I didn't like: 1) We get a few different Points of view in this book, unlike the last two. I didn't care for Cameron's POV, she is irritating and bratty, and there isn't much to like about her. The chapters with her weren't very interesting either.  2) A trio of characters that have been in the background sort of, have become slightly more central and at the end of the book we get a few chapters from one's POV. A sister, a brother, and the sister's friend. The two women are lesbians, and the trio decides upon a ""mutual agreement."" The friend marries the brother and remains the sister's lover, very openly. There doesn't seem to be a ton of point to this narrative other than to push Miss Aveyards very obvious views on the readers. I skipped all chapters with this POV. 3) Mare sleeps with one of the other characters in the woods and then hurriedly proceeds to take the little white pill afterwards ""easily"", all in the presence of another character who is in labor. Again, very obvious view being pushed. 4) None of the main characters believe in any kind of deity, and Mare scoffs the idea. 5) There is very little joy in this book. The story is very dark, of course, but there isn't much hope given to any of the characters. The character death that angered me greatly in Glass Sword is dwelt upon very heavily in this story, still being used to torment all the other characters. Even the birth of an infant is bittersweet. 6) The ending was predictable, so I wasn't surprised at all by it. Nor did I understand why Mare was so surprised either because she basically knew this was how it would go, deep down, from day one.

Would not recommend this book to young readers, or really, anyone at all. I will likely finish the series just to see how it ends and get rid of the set. Could have been a really good series but I guess Miss Aveyard didn't know how to fulfill the potential, or how to make it something other than advocacy for abortion, promiscuity and atheism wrapped in pretty covers.",1518048000,2

Synopsis:

 Just after midnight, the famous Orient Express is stopped in its tracks by a snowdrift. By morning, the millionaire Samuel Edward Ratchett lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside. Without a shred of doubt, one of his fellow passengers is the murderer.
Isolated by the storm, detective Hercule Poirot must find the killer among a dozen of the dead man's enemies, before the murderer decides to strike again.

So unfortunately I had to DNF this book 10 pages into it. I felt that the language in this book was something I could not get into no matter what I tried, but Im still intrigued by the story. Will definitely go see the movie!",1518048000,2
6720,493,16,"One night while Starr and a friend were driving home from a party they were pulled over by a police officer and her friend was shot dead. This incident sets up a chain reaction of violence, hate and mistrust between law enforcement and the black community in Starrs neighborhood and around the country. Through Starrs eyes we see her struggle with the shooting and prejudice, but also see her struggle to find an identity between the two worlds she lives in. Private school during the day where she is one of two black people in her class and in the ghetto at night where she lives. The Hate U Give while fictional is a voyeuristic view through Starrs eyes of how African American and other ethnic communities struggle to rise above their circumstances, and how a young girl finds her place between two worlds.

The dichotomy of Starrs school and home life was the perfect counter balance to the escalating violence between the police and the community of Garden Heights. As she navigated her feelings about what happened to her friend Khalil and whether she is the girl who fits in with the white kids at school or the slang talking teenager from Garden Heights her emotions escalate, just as the emotions escalate between her community and those who are trying to contain them. The two stories running parallel to each other amp up the tension. Even though I am not ethnic and did not grow up in those same kind of circumstances I was emotional, feeling everything that these people I had come to love through this story were going through. It felt very real. It felt very wrong.

I had obviously heard a LOT about this book before I finally made myself pick it up and read it. I knew it would be difficult to read. It was. As a middle aged, middle class white woman who has never been judged for the color of my skin, I was afraid of how I would feel when I read it. What would this book MAKE me feel? Well, I felt horrified. Ashamed. Sad. Sickened. Hopeful. Energized. and Ambitious. It made me want a change. This is why it is good to read and learn things outside of your comfort zone. Thank you, Angie Thomas for writing a book that was difficult to read. That made me think. That made me wake up. That made me hopeful for change.",1518048000,5
6721,96,819,"Definitely one of the strangest protagonists I've encountered in awhile.  Her love of chess and photography would normally be enough to endear her to me, though I am not the classical film buff that she is. What I found a bit of a turn off was the formulaic weak, damaged, nutty woman trying to understand what is going on around her despite flopping around in a mental cloud induced by wine and pills. Thing is, she certainly knows better as she is a psychologist who doesn't seem able to right her own ship. Granted, the circumstances that led to her condition were pretty scary but I have trouble working up the appropriate sympathy. Novel dragged a bit in the middle, elements were predictable and some were true twists so no problem recommending this to the thriller lover.",1518048000,4

6725,834,1237,"In recent years Ms. Shupe has taken to writing of the Knickerbockers, and in her new series starting with this book she once again delves into the people, places, and mores of the American Gilded Age. Her books are always filled with interesting characters and situations, and she does a great deal of historical research to make her stories shine true. It this offering the reader comes to know Lady Honora (Nora) Parker who is sent by her father from England to New York City to live with her Aunt and Uncle in order to separate her from a man her father deems unacceptable to be Nora's husband. Of course, Nora, isn't happy with this decision. She does, however, take part in the social scene in New York. She also devises a way to meet Mr. Julius Hatcher, a wealthy financier of the city. She believes he will be so unacceptable to her father that he will give in to her wishes to be with her love back in England. Nora forces Mr. Hatcher into a sham engagement, that the next day, he has no memory of (alcohol is part of that lack of memory). Nora believes she has a wonderful plan, however, as is to be expected things don't turn out to be what she expects at all. This is a fun read.",1518134400,5
6726,115,1844,"This book is well-written, but the text has been scanned in,k so there are many mistakes. The author was a sportswriter before the war, and it is obvious he knows how to write. It is one of the best books about the Pacific I have read.",1518134400,1
6727,751,1684,"When Earth is ravaged by endless wars, the wealthiest humans evacuate to a safe haven, known as CEIL, floating above the planet. CEIL sucks Earths resources and leaves those left behind to die; meanwhile, everyone living on CEIL becomes a victim to a new kind of evolution, leaving them pale white, hairless, and sexless. As reproduction becomes a thing of the past, CEILs leader Jean de Men struggles to find the solution, while back on Earth, a girl known as Joan of Dirt becomes whats left of humanitys last hope.

This book was high-up on my Tournament of Books reading list. Im all about sci-fi and dystopian literature, so I was very excited to get my hands on this one: a dystopian re-telling of Joan of Arc. It started out slow, boring, and confusing, and though the action and intrigue increased, my enjoyment, unfortunately, did not.

The novel is broken down into three books, each chapter alternating perspectives between Christine, a CEIL inhabitant, and Joan. Christines chapters are told in first-person, while Joans are in third. Christine has a plan to take down Jean de Men, even if it means destroying herself and all aboard CEIL; Joan pretty much has the same goal, though her true destination isn't realized until much later in the story.

The Book of Joan has an interesting premise, but manages to fall flat in perhaps the most important element to a dystopian text: worldbuilding. The plot just doesnt make a whole lot of sense. I felt like the wrong things were overplained and key plot points were underexplained. I always hate when critics say the dystopian/fantasy/sci-fi story wasn't believable, because its obviously fiction and doesnt need to sound legit, but I think I understand what they mean, now. Its easy for me to accept and imagine a fictionalized world, but when it isn't fully explained or things don't seem to add up, like in Joan, it kind of ruins the story. So, in the worldbuilding aspect, the book failed.

Writing-wise, however, it soared. Yuknavitchs writing is extremely poetic and epic. Even though the story didn't quite make sense, it almost didn't matter because Yuknavitch told the story so captivatingly. Ive never read any of her other works, and I don't know if I ever will, but I think her writing is what saved this book for me.

That, and the characters. I truly felt bad for Christine, pining after a gay man her whole life, and then suddenly losing the most human part of herself: her sexuality. Her lust. Her reproductive organs. I felt bad for Joan, bearing such a weight upon herself and always losing, losing, losing. The emotions were raw and, coupled with the way it was all written, really tore out my heart.

One thing I didn't really understand, though, is how Jean de Men came to be the villain. That puzzled me. He was characterized as this totally horrible, cruel, disgusting dictator, and yet we didn't get a whole lot of backstory for him. In fact, this is one of the fist villains Ive come across in a while that I feel no sympathy, no care at all towards, because we literally do not see anything of him except that he rose to power and became a jerk.

Also, wow, for its characters not having a sex, this novel is incredibly sexual. From artificial penis gizmos to imaginative masturbation, this book is full of sexual frustration. Seriously. And thanks to the end of the novel, I now know a lot about the genitalia of the female spotted hyena. Thats something Ive never been curious about ever. So, thanks. I think.

Though my expectations were not met, I still fairly enjoyed this novel. And I think I enjoyed it more than Ill enjoy many of the books in the Tournament this year.",1518134400,3
6728,609,1782,"When reading Trumpocracy keep in mind that David Frum is a Republican of unimpeachable credentials and a solid record of public service.  Now senior editor of The Atlantic,he has spent his life in political journalism.  I've read his work for many years and always found him to be challenging and well informed.  Trumpocracy is his most important contribution to American political life.

Knowing Mr. Frum's background impresses his readers with the pain and urgency with which he must have written Trumpocracy.  In a series of twelve well written chapters Frum analyzes the rise of Donald Trump and the disastrous 2016 campaign which unexpectedly put him in power.  Then he details the chicanery, open corruption, arrogance, and sleaze that have marked the first year of the Trump Administration. The unfolding revelations of Trump's deep connections and shady dealings with Russian oligarchs and their kleptocratic government  are also covered, as are the manifold incompetences and errors which seem to emanate from the Oval Office on a daily basis.  In what must have been the most painful pages Frum has ever written he exposes the willingness of Republican office holders, with many of whom he has worked and for whom he once felt great respect, to aid and abet the Trump disaster.  Similarly, he unflinchingly records the methods used by Trump and his campaign to suborn the votes of Americans desperate for change and con them into supporting a man who had no solid platform (nor desire for one) to help them.

Frum assures us there is still Hope in his eponymous final chapter detailing the rising forces of concerned Americans who are more civically engaged than ever before in their lives.  As one of those Americans, I found Trumpocracy to be both frightening and a metaphorical call to arms to truly make America great again.",1518134400,5
6729,580,1650,"I first discovered Rachel Gibson from reading her Writer Friends series and because I enjoyed it so much, I decided to pick up her Chinooks Hockey Team novels as well. And I wholeheartedly fell in love with those hockey players and their lovely women. Even today, the Chinooks Hockey Team series is my number one favorite sports series. When I figured that Any Man of Mine was the last in the series, you can imagine how sad I was that it was ending. Ive wished for years that Ms. Gibson would write another one and I would even check some websites every once in a while to see if there was a new book without any luck. And then I saw the cover for The Art of Running in Heels with ""Chinooks"" on the cover on my social media feed and I couldn't contain my excitement! I was unbelievably happy and I couldn't wait to read it, I didn't even bother reading the synopsis, but when my friend told me it was about John The Wall Kowalskys daughter, that only ramped up my eagerness to read The Art of Running in Heels. And now that Ive read it, I can say that it was even better than I expected and I wholeheartedly loved it too!

Its hard for me to go straight into talking about Lexie and Sean like I would usually do, so Im going to be impulsive and forget my norms which is perfectly appropriate when it comes to The Art of Running in Heels, but I won't say more than that because I don't want to spoil anything.

The Art of Running in Heels had me laughing from the very beginning and all throughout the book. It was downright hilarious with so many laugh-out-loud moments. It was extremely entertaining, fun, and playful, although it did have its heartache-y and make-your-eyes-start-to-tear-up times. It was wonderful to see the original characters and to meet all the new ones. I loved Lexie and Sean, they were crazy and awesome and theres not a thing I would change about them.

I cant tell you how great it was to visit the Chinooks Hockey Team world again. It was an amazing, heartwarming read and I loved and enjoyed it immensely. Im hoping that well get even more Chinooks books now and I cant wait to read them if we do!

The Art of Running in Heels is a standalone and if you haven't yet, I highly recommend reading the rest of the series whenever you can. Its told mostly from Lexie and Seans POV and they have a heart melting happily-ever-after that made me smile and put a huge grin on my face!",1518134400,5

6739,1046,1847,"This book is very difficult for me to rate and review. I really just don't know what I think of it because there were parts of it that I really enjoyed and parts of it I really didn't. I really enjoyed the first about 100 pages that talk a lot about the immigrants who lived in the area at the time of the 1888 blizzard and where they came from and why. (5 stars) Then, the author started describing, in long, agonizing depth, what happened in the atmosphere to create this horrible blizzard. (Seriously, pages and pages and pages of weather.) I admittedly skimmed parts of this because it was so boring. (1 star) The story finally gets back to the storm itself and the unfortunate people who lived in the area and were caught or had loved ones caught in the storm. It was so horrific what they went through. These were the families and people we got to know in the first part of the book. So, the reader knows their history and the hardships they had already endured before this blizzard hit. We are invested in the story, as tragic as it is. (5 stars) However, when I got to the chapter that extremely vividly describes what the human body goes through when ones dies of hypothermia, the author went into way too much detail for this reader. The author tells us in depth what exactly this poor group of five boys would have suffered through when they were lost in the storm, every horrible detail about what they would have suffered as their bodies shut down and they died. It was just too much for me. (And that disgusting detail the author had to throw in about what happened to a man's body that was not found for months until things thawed. Gross and unnecessary.) (1 star)

The story of Anna Kaufmann, a Ukrainian immigrant, struck me the most. I can't even remotely comprehend how she survived life. Hers was one filled with so much grief. Three of her first four children died as babies or toddlers. She went on to have four more children and then loses her oldest to this horrible blizzard. Her husband basically dies of a broken heart two years later. Then, she remarries a horrible, mean man and loses another son when his is only twenty. The book doesn't say what happened to her after that. What a tragic life she lived. My heart breaks for all she endured.

You see what I mean? I really don't know what to rate this book. There were some parts of the book I really enjoyed (if that is an appropriate word for it) and others that I was so bored and disgusted by that I could not enjoy them. So many of the stories were about young children who suffered horrible deaths (hence the name of the blizzard) that it was difficult to read at times, but I did learn a lot (yes, even about weather).

In particular I loved how the book explored aspects of human nature, especially the darker sides of the human condition which, even if we were to inhabit another planet like Mars, we would still have to address on a personal and social level. If you give this classic sci-fi book an honest reading, you'll understand what I mean by the aspects of human nature and the human condition as espoused by Bradbury.",1518134400,5

6757,621,1420,"My first comment about this book is that I want to warn people about some of the elements or representations in this book. There is both murder and death in this book, which isn't entirely surprising but is vivid enough that I would warn younger readers against it. Trigger warning, there is also rape and PTSD, and although that is not something I personally suffer from I did not feel that it was well portrayed in the book. I would hate to recommend a book and not mention an element that might be harmful to a reader.

Overall, it was a fun, easy read. It certainly did not wow me with its character development or world building, but I enjoyed the plot arc. The main cast was rather large with six characters taking the lead, although it could be argued that there were more than even that. We join the crew of space pirates on the Marauder, a rag-tag group of girls who cause chaos throughout the galaxy. It was nice to see the true sense of friendship and camaraderie between the girls.

The plot line was predictable, but that didn't mean that I enjoyed the book any less - it just didn't leave me with any surprises. Despite that, I am curious how the series will continue and if our characters will be given the time to evolve. I also hope that the worlds we have been introduced to in the first book will be developed further, for although we have been told of or seen a lot of Zenith's world we have not experienced it in a way that feels like a developed, immersive world.

I listened to the book via audiobook and enjoyed it in that form. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy all of the narrators' performances. There were one or two who completely drew me out of the story. In general though, I thought they did a good job.",1518134400,3

6766,1106,674,"While a difficult read at times due to its portrayal of society as narcissistic and self-seeking, Machiavelli's The Prince is perhaps the pinnacle of political science as we understand it from the viewpoint of governing society. Machiavelli's theories on how a Prince or King should behave or govern in order to maintain control or power in their society makes intuitive sense - it also make empirical sense as Machiavelli references historical anecdotes of various kings, rulers or princes in the Medieval Italian city-states which were constantly either in strife or on the verge of drastic change from leadership and political maneuvering. The Prince also serves to enlighten the reader, if you will, as to the nature of man and to be aware of people's general lack of virtue or ethics in society - in that way readers can become more aware of such realities in order to maintain their own place in society and protect their power - be it ruling an entire society, nation, or simply a household.",1518134400,4
6767,1046,1852,"In all honesty, it took me a while to really connect with this book. I read about 60 pages the first day and was thinking, ""Hmm. Maybe a 3 or 4 star book."" I mean it was okay, but I wasn't really connecting with the Peter, the 12 year old main character. I loved Pax immediately, but that's not surprising as an animal lover. As the story progressed and Peter sets out to correct his mistake (abandoning his pet) and meets another lost soul in need, I finally started connecting with him. By the end of the book, I was sobbing (admittedly during Pax's story). A beautiful tale. Some reviewers complain about the moral of the story, that we all need to really understand more about the costs of war. It's more than people. It's more than land. It really costs so much more. I think that is an important thing for everyone to acknowledge. While the story is a sad one, I think the message it conveys is an important one.",1518134400,5

6777,189,5,"Eleanor Oliphant writes about her life in a rather Pooterish style. She had been to university, where, presumably, she had picked up a rather pompous vocabulary. When the novel starts, she is a twenty-nine-year-old spinster, has a scarred face (we learn later how she came by the scar), eczema on her hands, lives an utterly routine life, both when she is at home and when she is working in a back office in Glasgow. She is prissy, censorious, obsessed with hygiene, and totally nave about life.  In the office her colleagues (except for Raymond, a scruffy computer chap whom she finds unattractive) make fun of her, which she ignores. She has no social life whatever, and says she liked it that way.

But all is not as it seems: occasionally she feels lonely, and eventually we find out that she has had a devastating childhood, had been taken into care, and was still subject to visits by social workers.  She had had a violently abusive relationship while at university.  We learn of a (single) domineering and undermining mother, who phoned her weekly to nag her to find a man in her life, but she has always protested that she is perfectly fine as she is.

But then she won some tickets for a gig in a pub, and on first sight fell for the handsome vocalist, Johnny Lomond.  This part of the story seems to me to make her not only odd, but actually mad.  She plans a meeting with him and prepared herself with some beautician treatment (and finds that her office colleagues no longer make fun of her).  She researches him on the internet, even found out where he lived and stood outside his flat without going in.

What with one things and another, she became, initially reluctantly, involved with Raymonds life.  She accepts more and more of his invitations, actually invites him for lunch (a first for her), and seeks his advice.  She is drawn by him into social events.  He obviously cares for her.  This is a little odd, since there is nothing much about her character that at that time would make anyone care for her.  In any case she seems oblivious of this, and she is still fantasizing about Lomond becoming her lover.

After several failed attempts to make contact with Lomond, she finally manages to get into one of his gigs.  Her fantasies crashed, and she realized with appalling clarity what a fool she had been to have such a crush on him.  With it crashed the pretence that she was completely fine in her loneliness.  She returns home in a suicidal mood.

It would be a spoiler to say what happened after that  but the last quarter of the book is very moving, as she is helped not only to recover from this breakdown, but actually to come to terms with the fundamental causes of her tormented personality and to become a more normal personality, feeling appreciated and enjoying some real happiness.

From a narrative point of view, the book has a few longueurs and there are, to my mind, at least four improbabilities in it; but none of this deters from the gripping nature of this wonderfully told story.",1518134400,5

Dante's writing and imagination of what the Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise entails is rich in detail and incredibly complex in its description.

6792,815,793,"Art Spiegelmans illustrated depiction of his familys experiences in Poland during the 1930s and 1940s is a complex narrative of the Holocaust wrapped in a memoir of Spiegelmans fraught relationship with his father and his effort to learn about his fathers experiences as a young man caught up in the violence and upheaval of World War II and the Holocaust.

There is a story told in flashback which features all the tragedy of the Nazi takeover of Europe and the efforts of Spiegelmans parents and extended family to escape or hide or survive their eventual captivity. But there is also a depiction of Spiegelmans relationship with his father Vladek which includes exasperation, conflict, and love. Its literary and literate, beautiful, complicated, traditional and experimental.

The odd visual vocabulary where Jews are mice, Nazis are cats, Poles are pigs, and Frenchmen are frogs both distances and make more intimate these characters. Theres a kind of anthropomorphism of the animals that affects the readers attitude towards the characters and also highlights certain aspects of their relationships. The cats are not friendly, they will accept money as bribes to help the mice and then turn around and trick the mice. They will do anything to get the mice.

Both of the stories told here are suspenseful, tense, and riveting. Spiegelmans fathers experiences in Europe include harrowing suffering, incredible coincidences, and numerous snapshots of a world which has been completely turned upside down. The scenes with Speigelman and his father show how that past has permanently left its mark on the father, an exasperating man with a cornucopia of obsessions that drive Spiegelman crazy. Both of these figures are great storytellers and ultimately this book is a marvelous story which is told with a sure hand in a variety of artistic mediums and techniques.",1518134400,5

A story of asteroids, roses, small planets, and creatures like the fox, snake and elephant, the tale would best be read in tandem with enjoying the utterly beautiful childlike water-colour illustrations by the author himself. The themes reflected the idyllic view on life and mockery of certain human conditions and their emphasis on matters of consequence. Easily disguised as a children's story at first but as we follow the adventures recounted by the little prince to the pilot, it dawns on the reader that the tale stretching over 8 days in the Sahara desert was anything but simple. With life and death of both the pilot and the little prince hanging in the balance, we also hung in suspense with what would follow next. Clearly the very grown up themes on life would surely strike an accord with all adults who read the story.

Why would she want to hand over to a man the business shes worked years to establish, along with her independence? But, because she was caught in a compromising position with Lord St. Vincent, she was expected to do just that.

Gabriel Challon, Lord St. Vincent, has been an expert at avoiding marriage entrapment schemes until he came across Lady Pandora. She was in distress and Lord St. Vincent, couldn't just leave her there.  But, for or his act of kindness, he was going to be matched with the most unsuitable marriage partner possible. However, to his complete surprise, he found Lady Pandoras spirited nature refreshing. Lord St. Vincent had never met another woman like her, probably because Lady Pandora was the complete opposite of the type of woman he should be marrying. But to his amazement, the more time he spent with her, the more besotted he became. Any woman would love to marry the devilishly handsome Lord, except, of course, Lady Pandora.

But can Lady Pandora give up her independence to Gabriel, trust him with her business and still save her family from scandal?

I'm not quite sure why anyone would want to volunteer to join in on any of these expeditions after knowing those facts; however, these women enter Area X. The Biologist's husband was on Expedition 11 and his return was not quite so happy because he wasn't quite himself anymore.

The women on their expedition, encounter various strange life forms, an interesting topography and learn that one of them may have secrets. I will leave it at that. This book is a very fast read. I read it in one sitting. The book has a creepy feel as I never quite knew if Area X was an alien environment, had nature ""found a way"" or perhaps turned on them, was this some strange evolution thing going on, etc. You get the picture. I had a lot of questions while reading this book that never quite got answered. Plus, one character seemed to have secrets and we never go to learn about them. This is the first book in the series and hopefully there will be some answers to the questions.

I went back and forth while thinking about rating this book. Do I give it a 3 or a 3.5-star rating? I did sit and read it in one sitting. It completely sucked me in. I enjoyed the writing and the story, but it also frustrated me as I had so many questions while reading it. Of course, the Author is not going to answer all my questions, that is what the next two books are for, but I still wanted just ""something"" more. I also appreciated how this book was a blending on genres: Science fiction, horror, mystery, etc.",1518220800,3

6812,941,698,"This book is a definite trip into a strange and peculiar world of pure imagination!
The Night Circus is a one of a kind book. It is written with such brilliant imagery you'll likely remember it long after you've closed the last page. The characters are mostly well written, especially the two main, and the descriptive writing style fills the pages from the very first few sentences to the very last. There are a lot of great ideas in this story and the ending is very unique and well thought out. I don't want to give the story away and with over 6000 reviews already, I'll keep this one relatively short.
The only things that didn't work so well for me that may work perfectly well for so many others were the lack of character depth for a handful of side/main characters and the flow of the story.  It wasn't the jumping dates so much as just a disconnect.  Other then that the story itself was really very good.

I learned so many amazing things about her life, and I also thought about the lessons she was teaching me, as a reader, namely that fame isn't an eraser for pain, trauma and racism and we all need to remember that were humans first....and interesting or not...second.

I stayed up way too late finishing it and absolutely loved the characters, the subject matter, and the journey Eliza goes through.  I love how everything comes together in the story and really enjoyed Elizas Monstrous Sea story as well as the story of Eliza trying to find her place in life.

All the side characters are very well done and I enjoyed all the twists and turns in the story.  I loved the family dynamics as well as the friendships throughout.

My only small complaint was that I did feel like the ending was a bit rushed, but just a bit and this didn't detract from my overall love of this book.

Review:
Considering the amount of hype over this book on bookstagram, the synopsis, and the number of people who have been recommending it, I seriously thought I was going to be shocked and awed by this book. I was not.
I think the plot had a lot of potential, the idea of blood being time has a lot of literal and metaphorical wiggle room, so I thought this was going to be an insane, epic thrill ride which was like sand falling in an hourglass (kind of like the cover suggests), what I didn't expect was the super boring, predictable love-triangle that I don't even understand since our MC has loved Brother One SINCE SHE WAS 7! Which is also the last time see saw him, which was 10 freaking years ago. I'm sorry, I don't know about y'all, but at 7 the last thing on my mind was loving a boy. At 7, I was more concerned about stickers and stuffed animals and playing in the mud, not making up some boy in my head to be amazing and convincing myself I am in love with him because he was a nice kid. I'm sorry, but I call bull on that. I mean, I get it, the author wanted to use the Insta-love trope, but she picked the wrong age to start it.
And the love-triangle? Could she get anymore predictable? The answer is yes, yes she could and she did. I won't spoil it for any of you, but even before A Thing happens, who Jude ends up with was painfully predictable. To make it even more super fun for us readers, there was also the amazing-totally-not-predictable-even-though-it-was-obvious-from-page-one plot twist that involves Jude being a Super Special Snowflake. I'm sorry, I get that everyone wants to read a story where the MC is not ordinary, but I am kind of tired of the MC being a Super Special Snowflake who gets to decide the fate of their worlds. Or maybe I'm just tired of the way it's been written lately.
Another plot twist that I won't go into details about, but that you should be able to guess since it was pretty obvious, was kind of predictable from the beginning and I wish they wouldn't have been.
I had such high hopes for this book because the plot sounded AMAZING, but it fell into so many tropes, it didn't build the world that well, I spent the majority of the book just being a maid, the action was less than a chapter long and anticlimactic, and while the ending is supposed to be a cliffhanger, it just left me more bored and excited to be done. As of today, unless the sequel gets amazing reviews from almost everyone, I have no intention of every reading it.",1518220800,3

6822,346,1697,"I was excited to read this book; the premise sounds incredibly creative and intriguing.  The book itself was an easy read and the writing flowed decently and was easy to follow.  However, I was disappointed in how predictable the story was.  I was also disappointed in how similar to other YA fantasy books this book is despite the creative premise of time being money.

This is one of those books that I finished and the stared at thinking well, nothing much happened there.  There is some intrigue and some magic; but generally speaking the plotline is pretty generic.  The heroine is pretty generic as well and didn't really stand out for me.  There isn't a lot of action, there isn't a lot of mystery, there just isn't a lot going on in this book.

6823,514,59,"3.5 stars. The story has 3 false starts, including the editor's two cents about the Magpie Murders' author, praise for the Magpie Murders, and backstory of all the suspects prior to getting to the first death. Two back to back deaths lure a famous detective into solving the murder of a wealthy man. All the suspects tend to be deplorable, including the murder victims. This lack of character depth is a turnoff. There's a host of suspects in the small town and just as the reader is to find out who the killer is, the final chapters go missing and we're dragged into the suspicious death of the author of Magpie Murders. I don't like having my chain jerked and this plot device does this. The murders are eventually wrapped up to a satisfactory conclusion.

I like subplots and even two or more main stories on a collision course. A story within a story seems to be a popular plot device among English authors, I personally don't like being pulled out of one story to be dragged into another one in another time and place. So I'm not a fan of too much backstory as well. And Magpie Murders does this. Ruth Ware tends to have more intriguing characters and more interesting story setups.",1518220800,3

6826,1052,1838,"This was one of those books for me where I knew from the first chapter that I was going to love it. It drew me in utterly and completely, kept me thinking about it whenever I wasn't reading it, and altogether left me feel satiated and happy. Rebecca Ross has created a gem of a novel that, if you are a lover of fantasy, is something you should definitely add to your TBR. Its bright, heartwarming, and hopeful, while also full of intrigue and action, a romance to fall in love with, and characters that make you wish you knew them in real life.

From the prologue to the end, Rosss writing is, simply put, beautiful. She builds up her fantasy world carefully and completely, painting a gorgeous picture of a historical French-inspired land where passions  art, music, dramatics, wit, and knowledge  are esteemed by all, and contrasts it with a Scottish-type country full of warriors and queens. And she does this without ever painting either country in a negative light. The protagonist, Brienna, who hails from both countries, sees only the positives of both and strives to find the parts of herself that come from both societies. Its both wonderful and heartwarming and gives off such feelings of pride for being of more than one thing.

The plot for me was wonderfully intriguing, as it went from Briennas final days as an arden of knowledge to her pursuit of returning the throne of Maevana to its rightful queen. The whole thing moved at an excellent pace, although the stretch where she lived with her patron and adoptive-father felt a little quick in terms of their relationship growth. If the plotting and planning that happened during those scenes went any slower I probably would have pulled my hair out, but I do wish the father-daughter relationship had been developed more during those moments. I did also feel that Briennas plan came about very easily, considering that her patron father and the others had been trying to come up with something for twenty-five years, and she somehow figured out the best course of action in less than a month.

I fully enjoyed the characters, especially Brienna and her strength and determination in everything she chose. She was a great protagonist to read by, her relationships with people were wonderful, and I loved how much she loved those close to her. I definitely fell for her relationship with Cartier easily, although he as a character kind of fell by the wayside towards the second half of the book. Maybe it was because things at that point were focusing more on the battles and regaining the queens throne, but I just missed reading about them together and learning about each other. A few moments of this happened here and there in the second half, but maybe they just didn't go into enough depth to satiate me personally. He just kind of became there to be there for Brienna no matter what she chose, and while I could appreciate that, I would have liked to known more about his own goals, desires, conflicts, etc. that he might have still been dealing with. There were many other side characters that I really enjoyed, many of whom I am itching to know more about, but all of them definitely made this novel such a wonder to read.

This book just gave me life. I loved the historical elements from our world that were blended into this fantasy one, the positive light shed on so many aspects of people and places, the romance, the relationships, and just the whole plot in and of itself. It was sweet and strong, beautiful and sharp, full of hope and conflict  perfectly two in one. If you enjoy historical fantasy, then this one is definitely for you.",1518220800,5

The portions where Poehler has her parents come in to do chapters were awkward and uncomfortable to listen to. Generally I just found the whole thing to be very boring. There is a lot of throwing names around, mostly names I didn't know, and very little of this was actually funny.

It actually got to the point where I was dreading listening to this each morning on my commute so I decided to stop.

For example, I normally would have loved learning more about all of the fantastical elements as the boy was exposed to them. I would have normally loved the mystery of trying to figure out what was going on. And of course I would have loved the darker tone that was hiding just under the surface throughout, but only made itself known a handful of times.

But I was bored. So very bored.

Almost everything just fell so darn flat for me. I didn't think it was very well written at all. The pacing dragged. It was very repetitive. I didn't care about any of the characters because I didn't feel that they were very well developed... which of course can work well in some books, but it didn't work for me here.

If this wasn't the book that I was hosting for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it.

However, to end on a lighter note: I did enjoy all of the little bits and pieces that hinted toward other things. Some of these were quite obvious from the start, but others only sank in once I had finished the book.

Like Julia, I liked Lucian almost in spite of myself. He's a bit over-the-top in his cocky 'tude, but he really did know how to make both of us smile, darn him. Of course by about 2/3 in he was making Julia smile for *other* reasons...at which point, whoa.

6838,444,482,"When I read the first volume of PERSEPOLIS, people told me that I had to explore this author's other work. Luckily, I bought volumes one and two of PERSEPOLIS together, so I could immediately jump from one to the other. While the first book primarily takes place in Iran during the Islamic Revolution and then, a few years later, during the Iraqi Invasion, the second book is about Marjane's coming of age in Austria: the place her parents decided to send her, where she would be safer from the war.

Marjane ends up in several places: friends' homes, a church (although she was thrown out for talking back to the nuns), hostels, even homeless on the streets. She writes about what it was like seeing a full grocery store after the scarcities in Iran, and the difficulty in living in a place where she didn't speak the language. She also writes about some of the racism she experienced, and her first feelings of shame for being Iranian because everyone saw them as ""terrorists"" because of the news.

I really enjoyed this book, because Marjane is so straightforward about her experiences. I think in memoirs there is a tendency to portray yourself as selfless, but Marjane portrays herself as honestly as possible, even at the cost of likability. One moment that particularly stuck out at me was when she accuses an innocent man of making lewd advances towards her in order to avoid getting in trouble with the Guardians for meeting a boy. She and her boyfriend laugh over the story but when she tells it to her grandmother, she yells at her for the first time in her life and says she's shaming her uncle's memory (the uncle who died for seditious activities that were against the Islamic Revolution). It was a relatable moment, because I think we have all done things as teens that we thought were humorous or fun that ended up bringing us shame later because of how they disappointed our families.

I didn't cry while reading PERSEPOLIS 2, although I came close at the end of the book, when she talks about seeing her grandmother for the last time. However, that doesn't mean that PERSEPOLIS 2 is any less touching. I liked how she described living as an expatriate, her encounters with her friends (and her enemies), and her experience with sex, intimacy, marriage, and divorce from both a Western and an Iranian perspective (and how the two frequently came into conflict). At one point she says something like ""To the Westerners, I was an Iranian; but to the Iranians, I was a Westerner"" which I thought was a great way to describe the feelings that many people with dual citizenship or people who are multiracial have of belonging to a group that is separate from those singular identities.

This is such a great series. It's easy to see why it was made into a film: the style, the narration, the content - it's all so compelling. As I said in the first book, if you're interested in learning more about Iran and enjoy memoirs written by interesting women, PERSEPOLIS is definitely a must-read.

4.5 to 5 out of 5 stars",1518307200,5
6839,444,793,"I didn't intend for my first book of 2018 to be so depressing, but MAUS is such a creative, important book. In MAUS, Art Spiegelman uses the medium of graphic novel to tell the moving, and sometimes hair-raising story of his father, Vladek: a holocaust survivor from Poland.

Juxtaposed against scenes where a now middle-aged Art is chatting with his elderly father in his home in Queens are scenes of the gradual chokehold that that Nazis formed around what later became Nazi-controlled territories. Vladek Spiegelman married into wealth with his first wife, Anja, and their lives before the war were rather luxurious. Slowly that all dwindled as their predominately Jewish area became one of the ghettos, and they were forced to run and hide for many years, until at last, someone promising to smuggle them both into Hungary betrayed them to the Nazis, and they ended up at Auschwitz.

Even though this is told biography-style, MAUS reads as being a little surreal, because Art chose to draw all of the ""people"" in his book as animals: the Jews are mice, the Nazis are cats, the neutral Poles are pigs, and the Americans of the present day are dogs. It was a really interesting choice stylistically, and I'm not completely sure why he did it - maybe to remove the reader one step from the horrors contained within the comic? There's a scene in here, one of the modern parts, about what happened when Vladek found a comic strip he did about his mother's suicide, which is included as an excerpt. This comic, ""Prisoner on Planet Hell"" is done with real people, which adds an extra layer of surrealism: a mouse, writing his memoir as a human.

If you're interested in WWII history and enjoy those ""literary"" graphic-novels that are about more weighty topics than capes and superheroes, I really recommend MAUS. Vladek is such an interesting man, and his firsthand account of survival is just that: firsthand. Really exceptional read.

4 to 4.5 out of 5 stars",1518307200,4
6840,479,360,"I know Ive mentioned this before, but I somehow missed the Rick Riordan train entirely as a kid. I never read any of his books, never saw the Percy film(s), nothing  my first introduction to the world was last summer, when I picked up The Lightning Thief, and I thought it was cute enough, but I wasn't super impressed, beyond totally loving the representation for dyslexia (which Ive never seen in any other book) and ADHD (which I have, and never see rep for). This book, however, hooked me for good, and now I want to read every single piece of work that Riordan ever has released (or ever will).

""I think its her way of saying anything is possible. Percy can pass seventh grade. Waffles can be blue. Little miracles like that.""

My favorite thing about the first book was Ricks sense of humor and the ways it comes across through Percys narrative, and that was only further enhanced in this book. While the first one was cute, the second one actually made me laugh a few times  theres so much more snark and sass, and it definitely feels like a slightly older sense of humor, despite Percy only being one year older. Percys outlook on the world is comical, a little cynical, and a bit self-deprecating, but never to the point of being a downer.

You cant give up on your family, no matter how tempting they make it. It doesnt matter if they hate you, or embarrass you, or simply don't appreciate your genius for inventing the internet 

I also thought the adult side characters were a lot more amusing and interesting in this installment, especially Hermes, who we get to spend a little bit of time with and who I really hope we see more of in the future. I loved his little snake sidekicks, and the fact that he talked to Percy like an equal, instead of being condescending or secretive like a lot of the adults in the first book were.

""We only came close to dying six or seven times, which I thought was pretty good.""

Of course, as always, theres a lot of adventure, but I personally didn't think the action sequences in this book were as harrowing as the first books, which was my only complaint  then again, this book was also a bit shorter (its the shortest in the series, at less than 300 pages), so there wasn't as much room to fit in the extra monsters and fights. I still enjoyed the action scenes we did get, and we got to experience more of Percys natural ingenuity, as well as the cute coincidences in which his gifts from the gods assist him at just the right moments.

Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy. Sometimes the best we can do is to remind each other that were related for better or for worse and try to keep the maiming and killing to a minimum.

If I had to pick just one favorite aspect of this book, though, I think it would be Tyson, and the family/sibling rep shown there. Tyson is a Cyclops, and as we learn very early on, related to Percy, and we see a lot of this struggle that Percy goes through between determining whether he should worry more about his own reputation, or bonding with his newfound sibling. Tyson is such a precious and sweet character, though, with a lot of his own skills and capabilities to bring to the table, and I loved watching Percy grow close to him and learn to love him despite the reputation that Cyclopes have.

All in all, this book was a total delight to read, and I cant wait to continue the series!",1518307200,4

6842,689,589,"This was a fun book. I don't read a lot of historical books (well, none really) so I didn't really know much of the real life facts from this story, but ended up looking some of it up afterwards because I had to know! Jane and G were so cute, I loved them together. Edward was a good character, too. They changed the real life version of events enough to make it interesting and fun, but I liked how some of the stuff actually happened too.",1518307200,4
6843,444,589,"When I was in high school, I would sometimes walk over to my best friend's house and we would sit down and write, and then post, fanfiction. Completely off-the-wall AU fanfiction, of the variety that's often known derisively as ""crackfics."" It was terrible fanfiction and, yes, it's still up - or was, last time I checked. And no, I'm not going to tell you where it was posted or under what name, because it was bad, and I was fifteen when I wrote it. We had a good time writing it, though - and I think part of the reason we (foolishly) thought it was so great was because we poured a lot of our friendship and humor into the fic, to the point that the experience of writing the fic was greater than the sum of the parts.

I feel like that's kind of what happened in MY LADY JANE. These three authors, who I imagine are probably friends, decided to sit down together and compose their own fic - only it wasn't Ranma 1/2 or Inuyasha fic that they were writing about, but history itself. They sat down and they wrote fanfiction about Lady Jane Grey, and decided that Jane shouldn't die, so they turned her tragic ending and short-lived rule into a ""spirited"" romance, and they decided that Edward wasn't frail and sickly, but being poisoned instead. And they decided that the war between the Catholics and the Protestants would be much better written as a war between the, well, not-shape-shifters and the shape-shifters. And they also decided that shape-shifter was too banal, so they'd call them ""edians"" with a weird ""d."" CONFUSED YET? I WAS, TOO.

This is Tudor history crackfic, only it doesn't really work for a number of reasons.

Number 1) The narrative is condescending AF. The authors have all these constant asides written in parenthesis, which are obviously supposed to come across as adorable and funny and cute, but instead come across as overly precious and hand-holdy. ""DID YOU GET MY JOKE? DID YOU?"" It's literally the narrative equivalent of a four-year-old child thrusting their macaroni art into your face.

Number 2) The premise is stupid. When I got to the first page, I was like, ""WTF."" And then I got five pages deeper, and I was like, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"" And by the time I got to the end of the book I was like, ""HOLY HECK, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING ME."" MY LADY JANE aspires to be many things - it wants to be Monty Python (and even rips several lines from it, including ""It's just a flesh wound"" and ""your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries""); it wants to be Ladyhawke (or East of the Sun, West of the Moon); it wants to be The Princess Bride; and I think it wants to be Blackadder as well, with all that heavy winking about history, but it fails at all of these because it isn't funny enough to be like Monty Python, it isn't tragic or well-scripted enough to be Ladyhawke, it isn't as romantic or as clever as Princess Bride, and it especially is not as historically astute as Blackadder, which had inside jokes about history down to an art form. This book's jokes about history is to mention anachronisms like Jimi Hendrix or to cheekily suggest that Edward was the inventor of the hover hand (no, I'm not kidding) or that Jane was the inspiration for using ""ferret"" as a verb instead of just a noun (because, you know, she can turn into a ferret). WTF, book?

Number 3) The characters have no depth and their personalities and motivations can LITERALLY be summed up in a single word. Observe. Edward: ""Sex."" Gifford: ""G."" Jane: ""Books."" Gracie: ""Scottish."" Mary: ""Evil."" ALL of their interactions and jokes are based around these words. Edward wants to have sex before he dies, and then when he meets a girl, obsesses over her single-mindedly. Gifford hates his name and wants to be called ""G."" Jane likes books in that annoying way that's typical of heroines, in that it compensates for her utter lack of personality, and panders desperately to us, the readers, who also like books (and is tantamount to a giant neon ""PLEASE LIKE HER"" sign). Gracie is a Scottish shape-shifter who acts like Merida, and for some reason her being Scottish is a Big Deal. Mary, who I always kind of felt sorry for, is branded as the villain. Because apparently it's not enough that she's got a drink named ""Bloody Mary"" named after her; she's got to be the cardboard cut-out villain in this book populated with Patricia Wrede rejects. Why not rename her Evil Evilsson?

Number 4) The humor is so dumb and lame. For example, Gracie is a fox shifter and Edward thinks she's hot, so the authors make this terrible joke: Yes, Gracie was a fox. No, really. She was. Literally. (We know. It's too good.) (47%). Bad pun, which the authors then feel the need to explain, and then feel the need to congratulate themselves for. The entire narrative is like that, and I found it really grating. Maybe some people will find it charming, but I prefer subtlety to sledgehammers. And here's an example of Jane showing us how much she likes to book her books when she books her booky books:  ""Armies aren't very good about carrying libraries with them. I can't imagine why. We'd fight so much less if everyone would just sit down and read"" (79%). In case you didn't get it: BOOKS.

I bought this because it was on sale for $1.99 at the time and because most of my friends said that they loved it. They loved it. I don't get it (I REALLY DON'T GET IT OKAY), but whatever, I'm glad they enjoyed it (even if I'm now second-guessing all of their recommendations to me). When I wrote that crazy fic with my friends, we had a few(!) readers who would actually egg us on to write more. They even subscribed via their emails so they could get UPDATES(!!!) when we posted. Young me was shocked that we had so few readers to appreciate our brilliance. Older, wiser me is amazed that we had any at all. I'm sure these authors were really proud of their book, and they had a lot of fun writing it, and probably all patted each other on the back for a job well done. And hey, for every naysayer like me, there's like a thousand people who ate this up like it was an ice cream sundae with the works. SO CLEARLY, something here worked for some people. But if you're going into this thinking it's going to be like Monty Python or The Princess Bride like I did, it's not. At all.

P.S. F*** YOU, G. YOUR NAME'S NOT A LETTER, YOU ELITIST BUTTMUFFIN.

I absolutely loved the iridescent cover and the story is wonderful but hard to process. The way this one is written throws me for a loop all the back and forth through stories following a Dateline is exhausting to keep up with. It interesting and curious but requires a lot of attention to detail and dates. While it was an enjoyable read, I felt it was exhausting and time consuming as well. For fantasy readers this would be a great read but make sure you pay attention to the details or you will find yourself confused quickly.",1518307200,3

6849,567,1800,"Though there were many things I enjoyed about Charlie and Ever's story ( Disorderly Conduct ) probably my favorite parts were the secondary characters/heroes and heroines of future books. Ms. Bailey tortured us with glimpses of Danika/Greer's future story--and the torture continues here as well, OMG--and though I knew I would probably like Jack's--now that I've read it, like is just too tepid a description.

I freaking loved Jack's story.

Ms. Bailey did a fantastic job of really showing us Jack and Katie--we feel their chemistry (explosive, all the time), suffer along with their inner turmoil (crushing, at times), and agonize over the very real reasons that they can't/shouldn't be together (which they ultimately make realistic strives toward resolving). And all the while she kept me wildly alternating between laughing out loud, tearing up in sympathy, and feeling the need to fan myself. There are so many highlighted passages in my copy, I can't even tell you--I'm probably going to go read them over again when I'm done with this just so I can giggle/swoon/blink back tears one more time before rejoining the real world again.

(And geesh, I thought I was anxious for Greer and Danika's story before--that's pretty much increased a billionfold now. Thanks, Ms. Bailey. I see what you did there.)

Denna is such a great character. Shes nice, funny, but she has a secret. A secret fire Affinity (well not secret from her family) that I thought was amazing to read about! Mare was an amazingly strong character. I loved that the chapters alternated between both of them. I felt like I really got to know each character, and it made me love them so much. I will admit I did see the twist at the end, but I didn't care because Ive found a new OTP. I will go down with this Mare/Denna ship!

6852,136,1838,"I received an early copy from HarperTeen in exchange for this honest review.

I solely requested this read all because of the cover. The summary helped too, but that cover really got me. The book itself didn't disappoint either.

We meet the main character, Brienna, as a young girl. Her grandfather takes her to a school that helps a select group of young women learn their best skill whether it is knowledge, music, art, wits, or dramatics. As Brienna gets older, she has gone through all of the passions and has ended up with knowledge. Shes not sure what she is good at, but her master takes her on for the last three years so she can find patronage. Finding that said patronage ends up leading her on a dangerous journey mixed with magical elements and memories from a past that isn't hers.

Details

The details in this novel were mind-blowing. The settings in different scenes were described perfectly and with feeling, allowing me to pretend as if I was right next to Brienna the whole time as an imaginary friend that she didn't know about (lol). Emotions from the characters were shown splendidly so there wasn't really a dull moment. Every chapter had something going on and this novel has A LOT of chapters. There wasn't a chapter in there that looked like a filler chapter, which in my opinion, is hard to do. It was all just perfect.

Brienna

Briennas character was very interesting. She is basically the outcast of her school even though she has many friends. She is very smart, so it definitely appears as if she has many talents, just not the ones she can have a patronage for. Shes strong, courageous, and willing to get something done. Of course, before the real action begins, she is hesitant but she isn't afraid to speak up or keep her thoughts bottled up for too long. Throughout the journey in the book, she definitely goes through a lot of secrets that should tear her down. However, her morality and will to solve this mystery in the book keeps her up the whole time. Oh yeah, it also helps that she has a certain special man in her life in this book that keeps her going. Nothing wrong with that.

The Master

Oh yes, the master. I was definitely confused about him at first because I kept thinking for the first few chapters that he was a gray-haired, old man. Then, I readcertain scenesand got grossed out. I had to ask Becca about his age just to make sure and she told me he is about 25. Thank God for that. Anyway, he is pretty much our main male character, though he is absent for a little bit in the book until Brienna sees him again on her journey. He is a very mysterious character, but he unravels his own secrets here and there throughout the book. He is definitely a brooding type, but not in a douchebag-y way. He and Brienna work well togetherthats all Ill say. I don't want to spoil too much. You can find out for yourself.

The Bottom Line

Im so glad I read this super early. I normally try to read my ARCs a few weeks or earlier before their release date. However, this book was calling to me and I couldn't help myself. I devoured this in such a short time and it was so hard to put down. The best thing about this book, too, is that I formed a friendship with Becca herself thanks to my fangirling and gasping about this book! This is her first debut book and its so amazing and I cant wait to see this hit the NYT Bestseller list. Its going to rock the publishing world.

By the way, I notice people assuming this is a standalone. According to Becca, there will be a sequel! CAN I GET A HIGH FIVE!",1518307200,5

6856,617,1391,"Magic, djinn, and a hidden city seem like the stuff of stories, but in S. A. Chakraborty'sThe City of Brassit's the unbelievable reality, both past and future, for one con woman.

Nahri has certain abilities to sense illnesses, understand and speak any language, and heal herself quickly while also being particularly gifted in conning rich people to part with their wealth, but she's unconvinced of the existence of magic. When Nahri performs a ceremony and accidentally summons a djinn warrior, her life drastically changes with the realization that all the stories she heard in childhood are true. Hunted by mythical creatures, Nahri's summoned djinn warrior is convinced of her unique and thought-to-be extinct heritage and shepherds her to safety in Daevabad, an obscured, yet legendary, city built in brass where the djinn reside and are ruled by a royal family. But Nahri's safety in the city isn't certain; while learning about magic and her healing powers, Nahri also comes to learn of the harsh realities of court politics and the consequences of clever decisions.

Rich world-building and familiar magical creatures take on a new life alongside new creatures to craft this grand story infused with Middle Eastern cultural relevance. Though this book is lengthy, it moves swiftly and is compelling, making the 500-odd pages fly by in the blink of an eye. Shifting between the perspectives of Nahri and Ali, a djinn prince with incredible warrior abilities, readers are presented with rounded viewpoints with Nahri offering an unreligious female one with vehement independence while Ali offers a religious male one with strong familial devotion. Fantasy worlds are a great way to address real-world issues and the way that oppression and prejudice are portrayed throughout the novel offer easy to grasp examples that mirror the realities of our world.

6858,152,819,"Words cannot describe my feelings for this book. I am typically not a fan of the psychological suspense genre but this book changed my feelings about it. Anna Fox is a woman who is plagued by her demons and is a fully realized character by the end of the book. A.J. Finn lets the story slowly reveal itself to the reader. This makes the reader want to read and read and read. If not reading like myself at work I played scenes over in my mind. Each neighbor Anna has and watches are completely different and can be plucked from every city and small town. It must also be applauded that the townhouse Anna lives in is a secondary character and you love the house. You can see the house, you can smell the dust and at times you can feel confined to the space. I found myself holding my breath and gasping for air at times. The ending is pure genius and something I did not see coming. There were plenty of times where I did not see something coming and it was thrilling. I can not recommend this book more and am thrilled at the success it has been having. It is one hell of a film and it will be perfect for any actress to really sink their teeth into. I will only slightly mention that I imagined Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Cate Blanchett, Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock in the role.",1518307200,5
