5450,1235,917,"Pros for me: Small mobile size, good for claw grip. No wire, so less drag and no possibility of a wire getting stuck up on something, and it does not drift when i let go of it (a problem when using a low drag mouse pad with a wired mouse). Perfect tracking. In 2.4 ghz mode, I did not perceive any more or less latency compared to using a wired mouse. Able to set DPI in increments of 100 in the software, and very wide range of DPIs. No software CD included, guided me to download installer when i plugged in the USB receiver. No restart required. Software is optional, can just use plug and play, but then can't change DPI. I feel that the mouse is built well. Comes with 2 AA Energizer alkaline batteries in the box. When the connection does drop with 2.4 ghz receiver, it is only for a split second, and it recovers ""lost"" mouse movement, so you do not have to correct for the lost signal by repeating the same movements again. The new beta version of Razer Synapse that installs with this mouse is really clean and modern looking, instead of having the dated gamer aesthetic of the previous version.

Cons for me: Kind of heavy with 2 AA batteries installed, have to overcome a lot of inertia and so is actually not so good for twitchy games in my opinion (but i can adjust to this). Rubber grips on sides are ironically slippery when hands are sweaty, more slippery than the textured plastic surface on the top of the mouse. Rubber also does not have longevity, it will get pretty gross and come apart over time. Connection is not too reliable with the 2.4 ghz receiver plugged in to my desktop under my desk, but i will get an extension cable to have it closer to the mouse. Razer Synapse software is a 100+ MB download with a lengthy install, not a serious problem in this present day of computing but it just seems way too large for something so basic (but it does manage settings for many other Razer products as well, not just this mouse). Requires you to make a Razer account, then to be online and to log in from the app, just to change DPI. That's asinine.

Other thoughts: I would have liked a built in rechargable lithium ion battery instead, for less weight and to not have to manage batteries. I would have preferred a textured plastic grip instead of rubber, because the rubber is more slippery than plastic when hands are sweaty.",1519516800,4

5474,1243,2574,"If you can believe it, I own all these versions of Skyrim: Skyrim SE on XB1 and PC, Skyrim Legendary on PS3, Xbox 360, Skyrim vanilla on Xbox 360 and PC and in total, I have over 2,000 hours on the various versions. I think I'll take a different angle at this review since the SE does bring a new feature to the XB1.

This version does come with all DLC, it's worth mentioning here that you cannot remove any of the DLC like you could on the Legendary edition, which simply means, the Vampire random attack parties start showing up at level 8. On Legendary, you could choose not to install Dawnguard until you wanted to deal with the vampires being a threat to your favorite merchants and other NPCs.

It also comes with fully ""new"" achievements, meaning if you have all achievements on Skyrim Legendary or vanilla, you can get them all again.  Using mods does disable achievements but Bethesda does have the Creation Club which offers paid mods that do not disable achievements. Some believe it's a controversial move but I haven't had any crash problems with the Creation Club mods but have with regular free mods.

The modding is the big, new feature and this is what I do since I want the achievements. I played my non-modded character for roughly 100 hours, up to level 55 with some power-leveling in there. I started getting bored and decided to try the modded character out. I did not start over. Instead, I loaded up 8-9 mods and continued from my last game.

This, to me, is very important. You can do what I did and what it does is start a new set of saves. Meaning, at any time, I can switch back to playing my unmodded level 55 character and still get achievements or can load my modded level 55 character and just have some silly fun. A few things worth mentioning, there are still bugs in the non-modded game, the quest, ""Blood on the ice"" in Windhelm wouldn't start for me but if I mod it and put the Unofficial patch in my mods, it lets me play that quest fully, which is relatively important since you'll need it to buy the Windhelm house Hjerim. There's no achievement tied to this quest so you get to play that quest, have access to one of the best houses on the game and lose nothing for doing it modded.

My goal is rather simple, complete all achievements, then switch to my modded character. The modded character allows much more immersion. In Skyrim you're limited to marrying from a set group of characters, you can only adopt 2 kids and you have very little control over your followers. With the mods, you can marry just about anyone in the game, adopt up to 6 kids and have full control of up to 32 followers. There are mods that to me ruin the game like a ring that lets you carry 10,000 pounds of equipment and weapons that do thousands of points of damage. I'm using the mods to add replayability. You can skip over roughly 50% of the quests in this game and still get all the achievements so you can then finish those other 50% quests with a modded character with all the added things you believed should have been in the game. The unofficial patch has fixed two quests that were bugged. I also like the mod that changes how the females look since most are very rough looking, you can pretty things up. The follower mod is good for many laughs. I had two followers with me while fighting a dragon and commanded both to dance in place. So, while I'm pounding away on the dragon, in the background, are my two followers dancing around like nobody is watching. I also use the immersive dialogue mod to make everyone more interesting and maybe more importantly, so everyone doesn't repeat the same line every time you see them. It knows your relationship to the other character and responds accordingly. No more running into your home and hearing your housecarl say, ""Hello, friend, I hope you're not here to cause trouble."" You'll now hear various sayings from, ""I've missed you!"" to ""How was the hunting?"" There are a few other mods that I like a lot like the one that adds more weapon types, those include composite axes (axe with a spear/sword), scoped bows, a knuckle-type dagger, the missing longswords, it's stuff like this that I love seeing in mods. My favorite mods are the ones that add extremely difficult ""boss"" type characters with unique armor and weapons. Most of these have their own locations and they don't really alter the game very much. You just fast travel to their keep or whatever location they're at and fight them. These are so much harder than anything in the Skyrim game. I fought one named Gotha who had great armor and mask with massive horns coming out. I used 16 health potions and probably 15 minutes, running around, jumping, dodging, timing my every attack just to kill this one character. It adds a bit of a Dark Souls feel with these bosses and I think that's one of the real weaknesses of Skyrim. Once you have the Dragon weapons, have them improved/tempered, you become nearly invincible but these Boss character mods add a whole new dimension. I do use the improved blood and extra execution moves mod as well. It adds a lot of realism to those snowy fights where you hit someone 20 times with a sword only to see a little blood. With the mod, there is blood everywhere on the snow. Last, I do use a few of the home mods like Waterview and Windyridge. These add homes in areas where there are no other options and Waterview has many areas to plant your alchemy ingredients plus custom stands to put your different weapons and masks on. It's located on the other side of the mountain beside of Whiterun and Riverwood. Windyridge is up in Winterhold.

The Elder Scrolls, specifically Skyrim, will most likely be my all-time favorite game. Another series has every chance to pass it and that's Fallout but so far I still prefer Skyrim to Bethesda's other masterpiece. This Special Edition, if paced and used with mods that add difficulty, is the best version. I do play it some on the PC but prefer the XB1 version just because it feels like my favorite console game was majorly improved.",1519603200,5
5475,1239,2575,"I got many hours in this game, very well made. Thanks Blizzard",1519603200,5
5476,1235,2576,"So pretty. Lights are a bit dim though, even on their brightest setting. Only has 8 basic hues to choose from for modes that let you set the color, but for animated modes it will blend through all hues smoothly.

I got one with brown switches, my first impressions of browns is that I don't like how they feel. The tactile bump part is very faint, and sometimes just feels like dirt in the mechanism. Once you move past the tactile bump, there's a couple more millimetres of free travel before a hard bottom out. Contrast this to a membrane keyboard, where right after passing the tactile bump, there is no more free travel and kind of a firm bottom out, and to me the membrane feels better than this. i can get used to it though. I usually type on blacks, and i didn't like those at first either but i got used to it and started to like them a lot.

The key caps are not textured. One of the joys that i have is using input devices with textured surfaces is seeing those surfaces wear down and become smooth over time. But i will get no such joy with this keyboard.",1519603200,5

5497,1248,1142,The only really bad thing about this game is that it's prone to crashing. The crafting system makes shops pointless. Sidequests constantly devolve into go over there and fight those guys for me or deliver this potion for me. The main storyline stuff does get good but it's such a drag to get there. Combat is ok. It's nothing special but does it's job. I just wish all the same class characters had some different skills. Just be wary of enemy mages. Their trap spells do such a high amount of damage they're pretty much insta-kills. And you can't avoid them (they'll appear right under your feat and then boom dead). It's really annoying but you don't fight them that much.,1519689600,3

5558,1113,2597,"DQ 8 is a game of firsts. First game of the series on PS2. First game to use the patented Akira Torimaya art style in full resolution in one of the games. The first to completely drop the ""Dragon Warrior"" name for the true series' name: Dragon Quest. And its the first of an alliance between Enix & its bitter rival Square. There is even a PS2 demo disc of Final Fantasy XII in the package.

Enix had made the previous entry in the series on PSone late in it life cycle (Dragon Warrior VII) and that had been a jab at Square because the first FF game early on in the PSone was the first to be released there was FFVII.

Many people like to say Square abandoned Nintendo because of the N64 and while that is true for the main home console market, Enix & Square separately made a reputation for themselves by doing Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles which were remakes of the console releases. So pixel DW & FF games reigned on. Sadly there was no DQ game on N64 or Game Cube.

Square was the more popular company but was bleeding cash because of the lack luster of its two massive CGI theatrical releases ""The Spirits Within"" and ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" so the two partnered up.

So what does this all culminate in? Something special. Having laid aside the history lesson, DQ VIII is a fun, beautiful game to play back then and now. Each character is amusing to listen to with full vocal conversations. Consider the 3DS remake as well.",1519689600,4

Its not that loud and you can turn the fan off with the switch while it keeps all the USB ports and charging station active.
It could be better but thats nit picking, im a fan for its price.",1519776000,4
5583,393,2609,"I remember liking it as a kid but now I realize how terrible it was, how are you gonna make a mortal kombat game and NOT have the insane amounts of blood and guts and balls to the wall fatalities?, it's just like how the mortal kombat flicks from the 90's had NONE of the brutal fatalities and NONE of the blood and guts, it's just sad. it's a good thing that MK9 and MKX went back to the borderline AO rated roots",1519776000,1

So on my second try I received this PS TV quickly from a seller called ""Murloc Express"". They provided excellent communication when I messaged them before making the purchase. Not only was the device actually ""Brand New"", It came unopened with it's original box with the original seal on the top and FW 3.20 installed!, not easy to find a PS TV with such an old firmware still installed anymore. Was easily able to upgrade to FW 3.60 in order to install HENkaku and with a separate SD card adapter for use with a 32 GB SD to install a good chunk of the games that I wanted to play.

Some of the keys would get stuck and paste letters across my daughter's computer screen and the only way to stop it was to unplug the keyboard.

5662,477,2629,"Do not buy a used copy of this game. This is a steam game and the code will say its already been used and will not work and you will not be able to install it on PC.  Now I have a used copy that makes a great coaster :) The ps4 version I own and its a great game, one of the better cod titles once you get used to the smaller TTK of the game. If an opponent gets the drop on you with good aim, you won't have time to retaliate before you die, even if you set max health to 200%.

I can't comment on the pc version versus the console ps4 version since used versions won't install to steam without a code that hasn't already been used.",1519862400,4

And it doesn't install like other games I have. So keep that in mind and you can play offline. I haven't played this origins collection yet but if it's remastered and if the disc work.

They have the art work on both sides of most of the games. I think it's cool. From the original NES to XBOX 360. I love retro games. It reminds me of back in the day. Do you know how much these games would cost if you bought them separately? 30 games for this price! Though, I wish they would've thrown at least one Donkey Kong game in here but that's ok.

After reviewing many grips based off of Amazon reviews, I decided to get this one.  After playing for 15 minutes whilst using this product, I can say this extension grip made my Vita feel like a completely new system.  It eliminated the instant hand cramp I am used to for the Vita, and made the controls of the system much more viable.  I wish I got this much sooner.  Also the plastic is perfectly textured, and doesn't make the PS Vita want to slip out of my hands as the original plastic did.  If you got a Vita and do not have a grip extension already, get this and you will love your PS Vita even more!",1520035200,5

Also I really like the feeling of pressing down the keys and hearing that pleasurable click sound while typing. Logitech added a roll bar for quick sound control which has to be besides all the cool lighting effects the feature to this keyboard theres been so many times where my tv was really loud when turned on and all I have to do is roll the bar instead of press a button this is a feature that I hope they continue to use in the future it sure does come in handy

5794,1190,2339,I've been playing the MX vs ATV games since the very first one so I was excited to get the chance to play a new one. However Supercross Encore is straight up garbage the graphics look outdated which wouldn't bother me if the game at least ran and played good. But it doesn't. Nope instead the framerate gets a bit jittery and the textures take a while to load in. As far as gameplay goes again...garbage. If you like to pull off amazing stunts like you could in every other MX vs ATV game then you're in for a huge disappointment. It's easier to pull off an amazing stunt in real life than what it is in Supercross Encore. There's Alot of once great gaming series/franchises that have been completely ruined for me over the years.

The maps are mainly just piles of rubble mixed in with people killing you from behind constantly. And who's dumb idea was it to make the sniper have to un-zoom to reload? That is very fake. And not a one hit kill with a sniper or any of the DMR style rifles? Really? Are we playing with superhero's? The game is setup in a very user unfriendly way. It takes like 5 minutes to even join a map and 90% of the servers are empty. You can't adjust your gun classes unless in a match (which also made Battlefield 4 stupid). When you are in prone, the guy acts like he is constantly having a seizure. He is flopping all over the place and falling off stuff. It's a disrespect to what members of the military can do. All in all, kind of a waste of money. Call of Duty is WAY better. Especially the older ones. Battlefield has taken a step back in the shooting game world.

This is for right hand users only so don't buy it if you are a lefty.

Kind of heavy. This is not a lightweight mouse like the BenQ Zowie. More like the weight of a Razer Naga Hex V2. I'm surprised because I would figure it would be more lighter. Boy I was wrong. I suppose this is because of the weight of the rubber grips on the left, right, and underneath the mouse where the weights go as well as a magnet to keeps the bottom cover intact (no, this assessment didn't include the weights).

Being someone who likes very light mice to lift and prevent hand fatigue, the tuning weights don't do much for me. You can place up to 5 weights inside the bottom of the mouse to ""tune"". They can be arranged in different locations. One caveat is that they cause the mouse to create more friction to the mouse mat. If you got a fiber cloth mouse pad, it'll probably wear more using these weights.

It feels kind of cheap. I say this because if I lift the mouse and drop it on the mat, it has a plastic hollow kind of sound. Tapping on the plastic surface has a higher ""tinny"" kind of sound compared to my other gaming mice.

Placement of the buttons are good. The one button that I don't care much for is the one near the thumb grip. It is located just a tad too far away from my thumb which causes me to shift my hand towards it. Losing that grip is not good for fast paced FPS games as you have to reset your palm. As a result, I claw more than palm with this mouse.

The scroll wheel is very good. I like the ""infinite scroll"" where it just spins forever. There is also a button on top that forces it into grooved steps.

Software wise, you use the Logitech Gaming Framework. Setting up is pretty much straightforward. You assign mouse functions, keystrokes, and multi key macros (keys only, no mouse operations). The UI is hard to read though because of the black mouse image. They should have just created two images - Top View and Left Side View to avoid the clutter and make the buttons easier to recognize.

The curvature of the thumb area is very good and the grips on the left and right sides are excellent. However, I'll leave it to time to determine if those grips start to lose their stickiness and erode. The rubber is pretty hard so I expect the inlay pattern to not wear fast.",1520380800,4

5962,44,883,"This review is for the PS4 version.

As others have said, this game in some respects reminds me of Bioshock and other games like that.  It has a good creepy atmosphere with some really nicely done graphics and level designs with the exception of the black blob enemies.  This is a bit less of an all-out action shooter and blends some elements of using the environment and stuff around you to progress through the game (which reminded me a bit of the Dishonored games).  It can be frustrating at times trying to progress due to the lack of clear direction of what you need to do though as well as the limited supplies can be a bit frustrating.  A but too many, notes, books and the like to read, which tend to slow things down a bit too much. Load times are a bit long and slow.  I am not sure at this point in the game that I am, that I like this better than the Bioshock or the Dishonored series, but I do find it fun and entertaining, especially the holiday sale price I got it for.

5971,300,0,"When I started this game I was fresh off of beating Mafia III and prior to that I'd played Watchdogs 2 and Far Cry 4 to completion so its safe to say I was entering this experience with a good case of open world fatigue. In all honesty this game shares many gameplay mechanics with those previous open world games mentioned, its loaded with collectables, towers and challenges a la Ubisoft, so unsurprisingly those activities tended to get monotonous after a short while. But, in spite of those hindrances this game is the most beautiful open world I've seen and in the end fighting robot dinosaurs is indeed as fun as it sounds. Most importantly the game has an intriguing and mysterious plot that keeps you compelled throughout and ends pretty nicely. 9/10. If I had played this game without open world fatigue it'd have been a 10/10.",1520812800,5

5982,319,80,"The original Blackwidow Chroma is a not so great keyboard. I got this as a Christmas present in 2016 and it lasted until around May 2017.

When the keyboard DID work, it worked pretty well. The lighting was good, the software was buggy as hell, and the switches felt good enough.

Okay, so going over the design it looks just like your average 2014 Blackwidow until you plug it in. One design change in the Chroma is the WHITE backplate instead of a green one, and that's so all the colors pop. You have 5 additional macro keys which are very nice to have, as well as a USB pass through and input jacks for a 3.5 MM mic and headphones. Nice job on thinking outside the box Razer. HOWEVER, this keyboard is made of a plastic that is a GREASE MAGNET. When I took it out of the box, it already had at least 5 finger prints on it from me picking it up. Overall, the design gets a B-.

The key switches. This keyboard uses the FIRST GENERATION Razer Green switches, made by a switch manufacturer named ""Kailh"" and these switches were not that great, and we can't be surprised by that because all other Kailh switches are crap. The Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 and the Blackwidow Chroma (And Chroma TE) had issues with some keys not being as clicky as others, as well as registering twice on one key stroke. Personally, I never had these issues BUT they felt VERY MUSHY.

HOWEVER, despite feeling mushy, they were very responsive and were actually a bit quieter, due to the mush. But still, a mechanical keyboard isn't suppose to be feel mushy. Luckily, Razer ditched Kailh and switched to Greetech in spring of 2016, Greetech switches have MUCH higher quality and feel a lot better. No mush to them at all. This keyboard here did get updated with the Greetech switch, but its pretty rare to find one. Overall, the switches get a D-.

What about the software? This keyboard runs on Synapse 2.0, I'm not sure if it will be updated to support Synapse 3.0 or not, but I highly doubt it. At the time when I had this keyboard (Late 2016 - Early 2017) Synapse was very buggy. Sometimes lighting effects wouldn't change or work right, it crashed a lot, it was a nightmare. Luckily a few updates in Summer of 2017 fixed all my issues, made my Deathadder perform a bit better too. Software gets a C.

Now for the icing on the cake, the lighting. The lighting is very nice. This keyboard features a white backplate while the Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 features a green backplate. The Chroma model has a white backplate to allow ALL the colors to look vibrant. If they would have used a green backplate, all the colors but green would look ""off."" The lighting is controlled through Razer Synapse, which allows for a few preset lighting effects, or you can create your own. Lighting gets an A+.

Would I recommend this keyboard? Honestly, no. If you want a Razer Chroma keyboard, get the Blackwidow X Chroma or the Blackwidow Chroma V2. You get upgraded LED's, as well as the new Greetech switches.",1520812800,2

This mouse uses a laser sensor. So the lift off distance is pretty high, and the mouse can get jittery at small movements. But, if you don't mind that or are a patient person, this will do the job just fine! :)",1520812800,4
5987,501,1656,"Ratchet and Clank was easily my favorite action-adventure game growing up. Even the later games, while sort of blah, had their own little tweaks and quirks that kept the feeling fresh and vibrant. Which is what makes this so disappointing. Everything, from mechanics and plot down to the jokes are just lifted from a game more than 10 years old, and merged with a second villain.

Pros:
Gorgeous scenery
Colorful and fun characters
Some good jokes, even with the blatant wink-wink some of them have
movie tie-in handled well without being annoying

Cons:
Zero new things
Great mechanics and villains removed
Zero new jokes

Overall, if you never played any R&C game, ever, this is wonderful. But if you have fond memories of everything from the initial game up through a Crack in Time, this feels like a big step back while still being a trip down nostalgia blvd.",1520812800,3

6058,91,2696,"I'm going to try to make this short. Basically you leave or toggle the contrast between 40 and 50,you lower the sharpness to around 5. Yes,LOWER sharpness. 0 would make it too blurry,so 5 or 6 is ideal. Also you should clear out the picture ""noise"". Mine is under Advanced Picture. Anyway toggle Adaptive Luma,mpeg,and noise to Strong reduction or NONE at all. I personally see no issue with Dynamic Contrast being better off not on. I can to either. Whatever works for you. So,you will see a better accepted picture. No it will not be totally great but NEAR there. Slight pixelations or edginess which can be easily ignored. Ps1 games will look expectedly sub par or not as good but a little BETTER. The ps1 games show much more pixelations than ps2s. Oh,you're VERY WELCOME.

She played it for maybe 15 minutes or so and went back to the computer for Minecraft.  I, however, picked up the controller and played it for at least an hour or two.  Then I put it in again a couple more times and beat the game.  Super cute.  Pretty easy, but still somewhat challenging on some battles, chases, or areas.  The battles or chases could be pretty hard for a younger kid.  I like that there's a map on the screen that shows you where to go next so you're not always wandering around trying to figure it out and getting frustrated.  The ability to take photos in the game and save them to an SD card was pretty cool.  The story is pretty good.  I liked this game and had quite a bit of fun.

6130,1337,2713,"Terraria is one of the favorite games that get played in my home.  I've played it on xbox 360 and the computer - the PC version is the best.  The controls on the gamepad aren't that bad, but they aren't very good, either.  Some things are much harder to do using the gamepad.  I will say that it is easier to see on the gamepad, but on the TV itself it's comparable to the xbox 360 version - tiny.  Which leads me to local multiplayer.  If each player has a character and world on their own profile then you can do local multiplayer.  Being second player is horrible.  Half because the controls on a wii mote are bad (may be better using a wired or classic controller.  Don't know.  Haven't tried), and half because it's so damn small on the screen you can barely see anything.  That was my main problem with the xbox 360 version - it's so tiny on multiplayer.  I've gotten a much bigger TV since we last played it on the xbox and it's still Tiny.  The only redeeming quality is that as first player you get the gamepad where you can actually see what you're doing, despite the controls being a bit slower to work with.

6143,10,617,"There are two games that come with this disc. The first, Metro 2033, shows its age, even with a remaster. This is not a problem, in general, but becomes a point of frustration when you realize that the controls are clunky and are not quite adequate for the type of enemies and combat that are required. Many of the mutant enemies are very fast and trying to fight them with what feels like a bad camera, slow reloads on a gun and virtually no ammo, makes for a frustrating experience.

The story is somewhat interesting and the atmosphere can be intriguing at times. However, I found myself becoming more frustrated as I moved forward in the game. This is not really a run and gun type of game. You have to have a mixture of stealth and gun play. The age of this game makes the levels very repetitive and all the the same. There is no hand holding at all, so you must have the patience to figure out where to go and what to do. Often, you are left scratching your head and wondering it you took a wrong turn.

I ended up quitting the first game and starting the second, Metro Last Light. There was a noticeable improvement in graphics and narration. This game felt more immersive, and the game play is initially fun, with lots of opportunities to be stealth and get in those headshots. Ammo is much more abundant and some people hate that. You spend about the first half of the game dealing with human enemies, which for good or bad, has a little of that COD feel. However, as you progress, they start dumping mutants on you in situations that once again, become frustrating. All of a sudden, you get stuck in areas where your mask filters run out every few seconds and often there are none to be found. You begin to deal with the same mutant in your face frustration and not being able to really reload your gun and deal with them as much. Once you get to the swamp level, the frustration ramps up. I had to start the chapter over due to not having any filters and then having to run through an entire area, rather than explore and enjoy what was an attractive outdoor map. There's some frustrating boss fights and you can find yourself dying from no air filters right when you kill the boss. The developers seem to be trolling the player.

I went from liking this game to just wanting to get done with it. Much of it felt that ""Cheap"" difficulty. Literally, kill 20 mutants, move to next room, wait on elevator, kill 20 more mutants, repeat. These kinds of situations can be fun if combat and supplies are adequate, but that doesn't exist here. I will say that much of the gun mechanics are nicely done, but again, having to reload every few seconds when mutants are smacking you in the face, is just not fun and leads to aggravation.

I would say that if you are a hard core gamer and like a challenge, then you'll probably love this. If you are more casual and don't like frustration, then avoid this. I'm somewhere in between, but for me, when a game is difficult, I want to have a smile on my face, and not to feel as though the developers took the easy way out by spamming enemies at me and taking away resources.",1521244800,3

6161,905,478,"The Basics

121-ish grams WITHOUT optional weights installed. 3366 sensor. 20M omrons. RGB lighting. Went to a Best Buy to pick up the G903. Tried G903, did not like shape. Tried G502, liked. Left store, meditated upon previous dislike for ugly G502 spaceship design. Meditated upon adopting a mouse that seems to weight twice as much as my truck. Bought G502 online next day. Proceeded to enjoy.

Why do a G502 review when the mouse has been around forever? Because it is still a relevant choice on the market, because I like going Nit-Noid on mice, because this mouse deserves the attention it gets, and because pleas need to be made to properly update a winning formula. Testing time prior to review was 19 days.

The Good

  Very good for fingertip, that style feels good even with the heavy weight taken into consideration.

  Good materials. Quality rubber flanks with some nice patterning action going on.

  Excellent 3366 sensor, low LOD. Surface tuning option did seem to make a positive difference.

  Good clicks everywhere. Primary clicks are medium stiffness and manage to have excellent feedback without being terribly loud.

  Excellent thumb buttons, no travel or rattle issues. They are labeled, (nice little touch) and all have light actuation with good tactility. All buttons on the mouse are good, but I do think they would be better with a textured finish as found on the G203.

  Logitech has excellent software. Reliable, intuitive, functional albeit limited in the total number of bells and whistles available compared to a growing portion of the competition.

  The software enables use of the G-Shift option. Basically you can map your mouse to act as a shift key so that virtually all the other buttons on the mouse perform an additional function when pressed with the said shift key.

  Good sniper/extra buttons, I think they are conveniently placed for medium hands and work well. I immediately missed the extra functions when I swapped away from this mouse.

  Infinite scroll is a nice option. I didn't know how much I would use it...until I ended up using it a lot. Another thing easily missed switching away from the mouse

  Apparently durable scroll design. I have no intention of opening this mouse up, part of the reason for that is because there are a number of good teardown videos out there. One thing I learned from a teardown vid is that the regular scroll mode gets its tactility from a plastic arm in contact with the inside of the scroll wheel. That arrangement seems like it would be more durable than what you typically see in most mice.

  A tilt scroll option is not only present, it is easy to use with mercifully light actuation.

  Between the infinite scroll, extra buttons and tilt function, I found the G502 superb for word processing. I had backspace set to one side of the tilt scroll, and the end key mapped to the other. The additional index finger keys were mapped to copy and paste, just for fun. Between the G-Shift and switching profiles on the fly, you can quickly run into more options than you can quickly memorize.

The Middling

  Decent looks in my opinion, but it took a while to get there. If you don't like the looks, all you need to do is think of its functionality, you can stab someone or club them with this mouse. Many uses, such versatile.

The Bad

  Scroll wheel is metal and not rubberized  it feels cold, often a little slick. Rubber should have been an update on the Spectrum model.

  The braided cord is what I would call moderate-stiff, definitely room for improvement.

  Scroll tactility is quite good, but rather clunky. Also, there is enough mass to the scroll wheel that you can overscroll easily in some situations.

  Scroll rattles, sometimes even in game. Not a huge distraction, minor gripe compared to the convenience of having infinite scroll available.

  Heavy weight means a lot more inertia for fast-paced FPS. This is an area where this really good all-rounder isn't so well rounded. The weight means that picking it up is not completely transparent to your mind in-game, even after a week of use. It did go away eventually for me. This mouse is probably unusable for FPS for players who operate below 1000 DPI, even then it is not ideal.

  Okay for small palm and medium fingertip, but larger hands (18.5cm+) that try to palm will probably drag their pinky or feel annoyed trying to keep it off the mousepad.

  There is space for a passable claw grip, but the 502s weight means you have to squeeze that much more with limited thumb surface area. This seems a good recipe for hand fatigue/discomfort over time.

  Scroll toggle button is useful, but would be better as the rearmost of the two buttons behind the scroll. Sure it makes a harder engineering problem, but that is why Logitech employs engineers.

  Rather narrow grip width caused some ring finger fatigue. I always thought of the G502 as a larger mouse, it actually isn't as big as it looks. Making the mouse slightly wider with slight modifications would make it much more comfy and easier to pick up at the same time since more of fingers 4 and 5 would end up in contact with the side of the mouse. The right-side grip surface should flare out slightly more to right with same basic curvature. It would also be good to raise the height of the right side grip section by 2mm to be just slightly more similar to the G403. Forward of the scroll wheel on the right side (where the ring finger goes), the lip section should be flattened slightly to give more options to ring fingers.

  The primary click button was loose in the upward direction. On my copy, if the index finger is not perfectly dry, the mouse button adheres to it and gets pulled upward with the finger and results in a distracting rattle when the two go their separate ways. This was one of the most annoying issues with the mouse. Thankfully it was easily fixed. I put a piece of tape along the front seam of LMB, preventing it from traveling upward out of position.

  Failure to update and missed opportunities. The Proteus core was released some 3 years ago. The Spectrum is still on store shelves some two years after Logitech updated their G logo. Kinda advertises that it is an old mouse. Logitech isn't putting 50m omrons on the mouse. Redundantly...no rubber scroll and no attempt at weight reduction with the Spectrum release. Makes me sad. Worse, the G900 weights 15 grams less and it is wireless. For the Spectrum update, Logitech simply added RGB to the logo and deleted some teal from the thumb rest. If it had been my company doing such a minor change, I would have simply updated the mouse and let people notice the fact there was a nice little production update.

Conclusion

Despite the fact this is an older design, the Proteus Spectrum is still a good design that holds up well in many areas. One of the best compliments I can give the G502 is that Im not terribly tempted to go back to my G403, probably my fave mouse of all time - and that is coming from someone who, until recently, was looking for a 70 gram gaming mouse. Is the 502 ideal for FPS? Nope. But, it is still probably the best all-round mouse Ive used. This mouses honeymoon phase lasted almost two weeks, an eternity for me. Thats part of why I kept using this mouse as long as I did  I didn't want to move on. Its not perfect, and there are several legitimate gripes. This mouses shortcoming are all the more painful because without them this mouse could have been A+ material so easily. That said, I look forward to using it a lot more. I hope we see a G503 come out in a wired and wireless version. The wired version should retain the basic shape with all the buttons and be no more than 100g with adjustable weights, 110g for starters with the wireless version. I can dream.

I was super excited to say the least.  I opened it up slowly & pull it out of its package.  I connected all 4 wires. The one power and the tri-color RWY.  I out an NES Game in and it worked perfect. I was 12 all over again. I played for about 30 minutes. Then I decided to try an SNES Game just checking to make sure everything is working properly.  Super Mario Cart had me hooked for another 30 minutes. Then come to probably my favorite system of the 3, the Genesis.  I pop in NBA jam tournament edition. Just like I remember. It play perfect for like 30 minutes. I stopped turn the system off to go make myself some dinner. I finished eating and I think I want to play some more NBA jam. I come back in the room turn the system on the game comes on it makes it a little music and stuff , I find out my Controller isn't working. So I am plugged it check it out plug it back in, still not working. Its now been seven hours later and the controllers for the Genesis are not working neither port. I know its not the controller because I have a standalone Genesis system that works. So needless to say the Genesis part of the game system at least to control reports are not working. But the other two systems the Nintendo and super Nintendo everything works fine. SI be aware when you buy the system. Im going to send it back to the seller and hopefully theyll send me one that would does work correctly.

Update:  Since I wrote the review the company, at no cost to me sent me another unit. Needless to say Im still having issues. Now It seems that there may be an issue with the game itself. Or maybe the controllers. But both controllers not working. That seems a bit unlikely. Not to say its not the issue. But a bit unlikely. So I popped in my only other two games.  And low and behold the controllers aren't working imo. Those games either. So it seems that the controllers are indeed the issue. So again I applaud the company for their fast action of getting me a new unit. Im giving you guys 5 stars. So if your a person thinking about buying this system. I say spend the money. Its totally worth it. And if you have an issue, let them know and they will do whatever it takes to remedy the problems. A++ if I could give you guys 10 ********** stars I would.",1521244800,5

6175,905,2621,"The Basics

Beginning of Jan I purchased the Rival 310. The mousewheel on my G403 had lost some tactility and the R310 checked virtually all the boxes. 3360 variant sensor, 50m omron switches, RGB and a safe shape. I used it for 6 days before writing this review. My Nit-Noidy thoughts are as follows.

The Good:

  The mouse is very light but manages to feel well made and not hollow.
  The mouse was balanced in the hand regardless of grip type, no ""heavy butt"" problems here.
  The clicks all around feel good. Resistance is significantly more than a G403, but less than a Huano.
  The side buttons are some of the best I've ever used - medium resistance and tactile without appreciable pretravel etc.
  I appreciated that the middle click was one of the easiest to press in, some mice have a middle click so stiff that its utility is virtually eliminated. Some folks have said that the scroll wheel feels cheap, I differ on this point. There is no rattle or wobble and the tactility is excellent with very light resistance - that means it is good for both gaming and browsing.
  One of my favorite aspects of the mouse vs the G403 are the subtle groove ledges flanking the scroll wheel. I tend to keep my fingers close to the scroll wheel and something about that ledge just felt right.
  The plastic texture on the mouse is good, it gives you a feel of the mouse but does not quite evoke a feeling of ""premium"" like some of Corsair's products.
  The sensor is outstanding as you would expect, I just wish it were placed a little farther forward.
  Lift off distance is low.
  The shape is very safe and comfortable, especially for a palm grip. It also works fine for fingertip and claw, but only assuming larger hands.
  Last but not least, the software is EXCELLENT. I'd considered Logitech to be the gold standard here, now I'm thinking Steelseries. The Logitech G software is around 270mb last I checked, is clean, functional and lightweight. The Steelseries software was only a 108mb download and managed to be even more intuitive with more functions than Logitech's offerings for the G403. One thing that the R310 does not have that many Logitech mice have is sensor surface tuning, but I never missed it.

The Middling:

  The cord is the least stiff of any I've tried and kinks were worked out very easily. However, the rubber on the cord is more ""grabby"" than most when it comes into contact with soft mousepads. (Not an issue with a decent bungee.)
  The primary clicks are tactile, but not quite light enough to be considered properly ""MMO spammable"" in my opinion.
  The DPI button is out of the way but a little too far aft of the scroll to be useful for time-critical functions.
  The mouse has everything you need, not much you don't. That said, I'd have liked to see an equivalent ""G-Shift"" option in the software to add more possible macro functions. The mouse isn't as viable to cross over to productivity work like the G502 with all its bells and whistles, but it's still ok.

The Bad:

  The silicone sides have a subtle mush to them, which is kinda meh. They do not feel great despite the nice patterning. They can retain a little bit of heat and do not fare particularly well for grip when/if the going gets moist...I think the choice is adequate for what it is intended for, and it SHOULD be fairly durable, but I'm not 100% sure. I would have much preferred the same textured plastic on the sides as on the top.
  My copy had slight pretravel on the left click with definite differences in click sound and feel between left and right click.
  My copy developed also developed a slight rattle on the aft thumb button after a few days.
  The mouse is very long while being wider and relatively low compared to the G403. If you have average or smaller hands, fingertipping the mouse will lead to either clicking the primary buttons toward the rear of the mouse (meaning stiffer clicks) OR you'll continually have the butt of the mouse bumping into your palm when looking/shooting down in-game.
  Using a claw grip for me meant reducing the thumb surface touching the mouse, making it feel less controllable. My in-game performance was still very good, but the mouse definitely caters to palm and/or large hands. For me, it felt like there was a whole lot of mouse wasted forward of the scroll and aft of the thumb and I ended up clicking about even with the back of the scroll wheel. If the mouse retained its basic shape while being shorter, it would be a more versatile option for more people, but might sacrifice awesomeness factor for big/palm types.

Conclusion:

Despite the questionable choice of silicone, the mouse is fantastic overall and performs as a top-tier option in my opinion. The software is probably the best I've ever seen. It is an easy recommend for any grip style, but with the caveat that your hand ideally be 18.5cm+ in length. It is because of the many good qualities of this mouse that the unsuitably large size makes me sad :(

6239,319,615,"The Razer Naga Trinity is the latest release in Razer's Naga lineup. The Naga Trinity brings several new features as well as a much needed sensor upgrade. So, lets get on with the review.

The design has changed a little. The right and left click have grooves in them, similar to the Deathadder, where the Naga 2014, Naga Chroma, Naga Epic Chroma and Naga Hex V2 has a slightly different button design. The scroll wheel also has a different pattern and feels like a Basilisk scroll wheel with the tension high, which actually surprised me. Otherwise, the design is the exact same as previous Nagas.

Feature wise, this is probably the most customizable gaming mouse of 2018. If your an FPS player, Moba, MMO you name it this mouse can suit your needs because its all of those in one. The side thumbgrids can be swapped out magnetically, in under 10 seconds! By default, the mouse has the 12 button thumbgrid attached, but you can swap it for a 7 button thumbgrid like the Naga Hex, or just a set of forward and back buttons. Razer implemented this very well too, you can't even notice its detachable when using the mouse. This is truly amazing, now you can just buy one Naga, and call it a day. No more ""Naga Hex"" or ""Naga Chroma"" decisions. Besides that, you got the Chroma RGB lighting with 3 zones, just like previous Chroma enabled Nagas.

The performance is amazing. Razer FINALLY updated the Naga with an OPTICAL SENSOR! With all the backlash from the Mamba TE sensor you would have thought Razer would have switched to optical completely. The issue with the laser sensors Razer used were:

They couldn't track pixel by pixel movements very well.
They would go crazy when you lift the mouse, and had a terrible lift off distance.
Had acceleration even though it was turned off in Synapse.

The Naga Trinity now uses the Pixart PMW3389, the same sensor found in the Deathadder Elite and all other current generation Razer mice (Except the Atheris and Lancehead Wireless) and the sensor performance is amazing. Handles small movements, liftoff distance is almost non-existant, and doesn't spin out. Yeah, an MMO mouse doesn't require too much accuracy, but not everyone uses an MMO mouse for MMO's only. I wish it didn't take Razer this long to update the mouse though.

The buttons, I'm 99.9% sure they are Razer mechanical Omron switches. They are very clicky, tactile and have a nice snap, but no accidental clicks. And to all you Minecraft PVP'ers out there, they are very easy to jitterclick with! The buttons on each thumbgrid are also very tactile and easy to press, so they don't require 3 tons of thumb pressure to actuate, like the uTechSmart Venus.

The mouse is powered by Razer Synapse 3. In the software you can calibrate the mouse, reprogram the buttons, change your lighting settings, manage your warranty etc. The sky really is the limit with this mouse. And with Razer Hypsershift, you can assign secondary functions to the buttons, kind of the like FN key on a keyboard. The really is the limit.

Would I recommend this mouse? YES! I've tried the uTechSmart Venus, Corsair Scimitar, Razer Naga HEX v2 and this comes out on top. The uTechSmart has an awful sensor and is made of some form of plastic that feels like sandpaper, the Corsair Scimitar's shape is a bit too awkward for me, and the Naga Hex v2 has a terrible sensor, there's no shape like the Naga. And now that it has a top optical sensor, its possibly one of the best gaming mice ever made. Very customizable, very friendly. A bit pricey, but it worth every penny! Go and buy it!",1521417600,5

6246,1337,2744,"This is a series of ten main lessons that teaches you art basics and gets a little more advanced as you progress.  After the first few lessons it starts giving you mini lessons where the artist walks you through the steps that you did previously, gives you a reference photo and you get to work on your own.  There is a free paint section where you can choose your own reference photo to work from or take a photo yourself to use.  Unfortunately, there's no way to pull in a photo from the ds photo gallery or to export your work to the ds.  I believe in the 3ds version you do have the ability to export to the device.  One you finish a drawing or painting you can choose to save it to the gallery in the software, choose a frame for it, and have the ability to go through and look at your work later.

I went through all ten lessons and several mini lessons within a couple days.  It was a bit disappointing that there weren't more guided lessons.  Even so I had a blast with this.  It held my interest, reacquainted me with some techniques I had forgotten about, and taught me how to layer the paint.  I was impressed with how everything looks on the screen and how well the media in the software mimics real life media as well.  It doesn't mimic everything exactly, but it's pretty impressive for what it is.

I am addicted to cats and all animals for that matter that when I saw these yueton paw pads I ordered them immediately. I was worried at first that these would not fit as they looked extremely small in the package. They stretch and fit nicely on the analogs which is great so there is no movement of them while gaming.

Only after I bought it did I find out that it takes forever to download.  On top of that if I use my PS4 for anything else it closes the download.  I'm pretty pissed.  I put my system on rest mode to go to work came back and it hadn't budged.  It downloads at about 1% every 45min.  Get the disk version and hopefully that will work.  Now I see why it was only $29 for the dcl.
My fault for not reading al the reviews.  I'll let you all know if the game itself sucks...however even if it's awesome I think the hassle and bs that comes with it makes it a huge don't buy.  Hell....it's march of 2018 and the servers are still lacking...so I guess I'm screwed.

The butterfly effect is a major factor in this game which makes it more interesting. I highly recommend this game if you like interactive games with a movie-like feel.

6360,461,2173,"Warioware Inc, Mega Party Game$ is an upgraded port of the Gameboy Advance title, Warioware Inc, Microgame Mania.  It rides the heels of Mario Party, but the main differences are that the games only last a few seconds, cover a wide variety of genres, and have the stupidity/randomness upgraded enormously.

The story in this game is pretty much nonexistent, but when was the last time you played a party game for the story?  This game provides a single player experience, where the player must win Microgames to progress the and get to the next genre.  Genres include Intro, Sports, Strange, Nature, and Realistic to mention just a few.  You only have four chances to reach the boss of the set of minigames, and if you lose all the your lives, the game is over and you must restart from the start of the genre you failed at.  Finishing the boss will grant an extra life if any were lost before moving to the next genre.  Each game has three stages of difficulty and some can get really tough given the limited time, or the sometimes sensitive conditions you have to complete to win.  The more games that get completed, the faster the games get.

The game provides a decent but short lived single player experience, but it really shines in Multiplayer.  There's ten playable characters to play as, including Wario himself, The lovely and wacky Mona, The ninja Kindergartners Kat and Ana, the intelligent but clumsy alien Orbulon, The taxi drivers who go to space like it's just part of the job (because it is) Dribble and Spitz, the brilliant but insane scientist Dr. Crygor, the Nintendo Fanboy's Nintendo fanboy 9-Volt, and the dancing addict Jimmy T.  The characters look different and have different animations, but all play the same and the differences are only cosmetic. There are Twelve multiplayer games, but let's go over the main ones real quick.

Survival Fever: Simple Last Man Standing match where players continue to play mini games with three lives each.  The last one with any lives left wins.  If there are more than two players, when a player loses all of their lives, it turns into Outta My Way.  (more on that below)

Outta My Way: Outta My Way is a game where one player plays fifteen micro games, and the other players do their best to get in the way.  They can move around the screen, jump, which causes the screen to shake when they land, and pose to get bigger.  After all the players have gone, the player with the most wins is the victor.

Balloon Bang: This one gets flat out intense.  One player plays micro games while the others inflate a balloon.  If the player wins a game, another player is put in the hot seat while the others continue to inflate the balloon.  The screen will flash red and a siren will go off with the balloon is reaching critical mass.  When the balloon pops, the player who was playing loses.

Card E-Cards: This is an interesting one but one of the longer games.  Players take turns drawing cards from two decks, the cards act as micro games.  When a certain card is drawn, the player who drew that card plays all the micro games drawn.  If they win all the games, they get all the cards added to their pile.  But while a player is playing, other players can steal cards from other piles.  However, if the player who is doing the games loses a game, they lose all the cards that were drawn in that round, as well as all the cards in their pile.  These lost cards go into the Deck, and the next player to win all the games assigned to them gets all of them.  In the end, the player with the most cards wins.

Doctor's Orders: This is my personal favorite.  In this one, the microgames are negligible.  The players are given a task to do in real life.  Silly things like pretending they are about to sneeze, saying the name of their father, holding the controller upside down, etc.  The other plays then clap (press A for one clap) based on how the player did.  There are four rounds and the player with the most claps wins.

Wobbly Bobbly: To start, the players all are on one turtle.  They must play a microgame that all play.  These continue the silly/random trend,  and the winner of that game will get to play a legit, one player micro game.  If they win, the other players get an extra turtle.  If the player loses, they get a smaller turtle.  Then the turtles are all flipped on their backs and the players must balance.  This gets insane with more turtles.  IF a player loses balance they become a turtle and lose.  the last player standing wins.

Milky way Delirium: This is also one of the longer ones.  Players are presented with an asteroid belt, the astroids having numbers on them.  The bigger the asteroid, the bigger the number.  Players take turns shooting the asteroids to make them smaller.  Each shot results in a minigame.  If the player is able to completly destroy an asteroid, they become a token.  The game is basically Othello as trapping other tokens between yours will give you those tokens.  Half way through, there is a mini game battle.  The players keep playing games until they win.  The winner then gets to steal some tokens.  Then the game continues until no astroids are left, but the game is not over yet.  The player with the most tokens now plays a microgame, but the other player's tokens block the screen.  This means that even if you win the othello game, you can still lose.  If the player wins the mini game despite the blocks, they win.  If not, the other players win.

All for one: This is the odd duck out because it is cooperative rather than competative.  The powerh as gone out and one player plays micro games while the others use flashlights to light up a part of the screen.  Only three games can be lost.  After that, the players are rated on how well they know each other.

There's a few more but I haven't played them much so I don't remember them.

The game has a very cartoony style to it that fits very well.  I really can't think of any nitpicks.  I will say though, that the games evolved and got better with time.

In the end, if you have a GameCube, and friends you regularly play multiplayer with on it, you need to add this to your collection, its zany humor and chaotic games can make for a lot of good laughs.",1521763200,5

Difficult to pick up, repetitive, and less than rewarding after a few hours play. Especially if you run into a group who are only interested in griefing players who actually want to work the content. It is a beautifully crafted work missing any sustainable reward system, demo level content, lifeless mechanics, tailor-made for griefers.

6494,769,2656,"I purchased a 3 pack of these 1UP Card Cartridge Cleaning kits to see if they work any where's nearly as good as people clam they do. I used Swan - 99% Isopropyl Alcohol for the cleaning solution & gave it the test on 30+ year old NES & Genesis video game cartridges that were dirty & had very tarnished contact pins. I choose 5 NES video games & 5 Genesis video games that would not boot & didn't work to test the product. I cleaned them as well as the product could & the results were not impressive at all. I got 1 out of 5 NES video games to work & 2 out of 5 Genesis video games to work with this product. I ended up having to use my #1 trusted solution that works every single time to fix my cartridge video games & get them to work, Brite Boy - Metal Polish & Cotton Swabs. I am pretty disappointed in how this product performed & at the price these cost, they should perform light years better. I feel this product is really only good for removing finger prints off of the cartridge PCB pins, which a cotton swab can already do for far, far, far less money. The only way I could recommend this product to other customers, is if they have clean cartridge pins already & that is about it. Because don't expect this product to remove any kind of tarnish from off of the cartridge contact pins or you will be quickly disappointed in how this product performs & you should look for a way better solution to fix your cartridge video games.",1522195200,2

6527,1337,904,"There are so many good reviews for Elite Beat Agents, and it's on so many top DS game lists and video's; and yet.  It sounds interesting and fun so I picked it up at a pawn shop, but I didn't really like it

I really liked the art style, and from what I did play of this game some of it was interesting and/or funny, but I really didn't like the gameplay or most of the music.  The way you actually play (which is a bit hard to explain) is that there are colored in circles with numbers on them.  There are circles that go in towards the colored in circle and you have to tap the inner circle with the stylus with the outer circle hits it.  There are numbers on the circles and you have to tap them in order as the circles hit them.  Other times there may be a circle you have to hit at that time, but slide the stylus along the ball towards the end, and sometimes back again.  Other times you may have to hit the same circle twice if it has two circle lines going in towards it.  At the end of the level you have a circular disc that you have to spin around with the stylus.  The story and what's happening is on the top screen, while the agents dancing are on the bottom screen.  So, during play you don't really get to see what's happening on the top screen when you're playing because you have to pay attention to what you have to do, but before you start the next part you can look up and see whether you did well or not based on what happens and the circle that appears at the end saying you passed.  I remember that there are three sections of the song and story and you have to pass at least two to have beat the level.  Each part starts out with a comic book scene that you can choose to skip, but it's pretty slow and you can't really speed it up.

At the start there is a choice of what level to play it as, starting from easy.  I started with the next level above easy, but then had to go down to easy because the gameplay was just too hard.  After I started out on easy it wasn't too bad for a while, but it progressively got harder to the point where I was having difficulty keeping up or doing the right thing, so it's definitely a challenge to hit the right thing at the right time or slide the stylus along the balls, etc.  Sometimes it goes very fast.

As for the music, there were a few songs that I did like and it wasn't too bad playing during those songs, but for the other ones they were just really irritating and grating.  It seemed harder and more like a chore to get through.

There are good elements to this game, but for the most part I just didn't care for it.",1522281600,2

6529,1406,2810,"For a console wrap, its pretty nice, the vinyl used is high quality and is similar to 3M Di-Noc with the air release pattern on the back of the vinyl to aid in releasing trapped air bubbles in the vinyl.
I've been on a kick with wrapping my gaming gear in carbon fiber vinyl, as it started as a way to cover up some painted on branding on my power supply shroud in my computer case that could be seen through the tempered glass side panel. It then spread to me wrapping a lot of the components the case that wouldn't effect thermals (i didn't put them on heat sinks or anything, just small plastic pieces that otherwise look like plastic, and way better with the carbon vinyl)
I was about to just take the roll that i already have to my Xbox, but didn't want to bother with messing up the power sensor and the xbox logo on the top, so I opted for this.
The vinyl is a littler more glossy, and a little darker shade of gray compared to the 3M vinyl, but looks close enough, and really makes my Xbox one look a little better, especially since I've covered up the fingerprint and dust magnet that is the glossy black plastic covering most of the shell.",1522281600,5

6581,1284,523,"If I could give my review a 10/5 stars I would! I purchased 2 BRAND NEW SEALED PS Vita Slims with 3.55 firmware from seller Above All Games with FBA (fulfillment by Amazon). Items came in USA/NA PCH-2001 black edition, all shiny and new with seals both top and bottom of boxed packaging untouched. From my pictures the seal residues on the box front are from how these units are stored before shipment, they seem to have been stacked on top of one another. Don't worry as those are not the actual box seals (just residues) as they are on the front of the box so don't be alarmed by my images. You will see from the back of the box image I provide, untouched manufacturer seals are in tact and untouched. Everything was included in each box; PS Vita Slim PCH-2001 unit with 1GB INTERNAL memory (NO individual card, it's not included in this boxed unit, sold separately), USB cable, AC adapter, AC power cord, 2 quick start guides in English and French with safety guide booklet. Both units had more than enough charge to start up and edit your desired settings.

I purchase 2 units for both my husband and I to enjoy. I have been using the one unit since I received it and it works great for remote play using powerline wifi access point and adapter in our home. My husband setup the access point wifi in our master bedroom since our PS4 Pro unit is in our game room. Without his setup, we did notice terrible gameplay quality via remote play with just using simple private internet network. With the access point wifi in place, picture and sound quality is SUPERB on the PS Vita especially for its LCD screen. I can finally relax in bed and play my PS4 games while my husband reads his book or watches tv, and vise versa. The audio bluetooth capability of the unit also comes in handy. The one drawback to these units are the memory cards, they are expensive! I will mainly be playing with my PS Vita via remote play so I have no need for more than the internal memory that Sony has provided with the PS Vita slims. I did order an adapter memory card, but it did not fit properly on either unit. Bit the bullet and awaiting the PS Vita made memory card instead just in case for my husband's personal use with his PS Vita unit.

Overall, the risk was high when purchasing these on Amazon and picking the right seller. I'm so happy I received what was advertised :)",1522454400,5

6593,1284,2824,"I was so excited to receive it and started using it immediately. I'm not sure if what I got was a defect, but the L2/R2 were not as responsive and often times would not trigger the back touch screen. I ordered another L2/R2 grip along with this Joetsu grip and the other brand Hori worked perfectly. This item also had an annoying squeak on the right grip during use, it became distracting during gameplay. It was also a PAIN to remove this grip and needed my husband's help so I could ship it back to Amazon. I have no idea why it took two people to carefully remove the device... but we both held our breath as the device was a recently purchased brand new PS Vita Slim. I also purchased the matching case for this grip and let me tell you if you do not plan on remote playing with other grips that have front L2/R2 trigger grips or L3/R3 trigger grips then this grip and it's matching case is for you. Either have a really good armour skin on your Vita if you plan to put this on and off your Vita constantly because it will scratch your device (or even break the grip with too much tension).

UPDATE: After getting a new PS Vita Slim in aqua blue I decided to reorder this grip from Joetsu again. I find the Joetsu grips much more comfortable for my small hands. Happy to report that my second and third purchase of this product came with zero issues, responsive triggers with still slight squeak on the grips. The squeak is not as loud as my first order on my original review so I've been able to enjoy gameplay. I ordered the third grip as a backup seeing as vita grips sell quick and the prices end up increasing. My aqua blue vita will stay stationary in this grip so having the matching case is such a great combo. I did add a clear back film on my vita to go along with this grip to prevent any scratches from excessive use of the triggers. I did this with all 3 of my vitas, the other 2 have full body carbon skins. The main reason why this grip was finally a keeper for me besides the comfort is again the matching case. It's so nice to have one of my vitas with ready attached grip and case.

6652,1284,1180,"I purchased two of these ridiculously expensive PSV memory cards from seller APEX GAMES (USA) with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). I originally only purchased one for my husband, but after browsing Amazon and getting great deals on PS Vita games it only made sense to just get one for myself. I do want to note beforehand that the cards I received from APEX GAMES (USA) are the Asia version (Taiwan/Korea - PCH-Z641G), NOT Japan version (PCH-Z641J) like stated in the description and title. Because of this I knocked off one star as I did not receive the actual version I paid for. After reading up on differences and seeing that the G version cost more on the play-asia site (where PS Vita is commonly found), that site states the J version may experience issues with PSV 1000 devices (aka fat vitas). Now I don't own the PSV 1000, but the 2000 slim so I decided to keep the G and tested them out. So far no issues only time will tell when and if these cards deteriorate with excessive use. I was able to transfer a small saved file I had from my internal slim memory onto the card without any issues. I've read issues with both G and J versions so whatever card I got would of been a risk either way. Leave it to Sony to make a proprietary memory card that might and might not work overtime with such a high price tag. Both cards gave me 60gb of free storage. If you are wondering where the 4gb went, simple answer is system data after formatting.

UPDATE: I ordered a third 64gb PSV memory card for another PS Vita, but this time from seller cus mart and got exactly as advertised! BRAND NEW SEALED PCH-Z641J and is in working order. So far both Japan (PCH-Z641J) and Asia (PCH-Z641G) versions of this 64gb memory card has been working perfectly since purchase. NEVER remove the memory card while your device is on/sleep mode, high chances of file corruption.",1522713600,4

I was worried before placing my order since the image description has the day one edition cover, but the description doesn't mention any of the DLC contents. After receiving the product, I was thrilled to see that it was indeed the physical copy of the day one edition. The reason why I wanted the day one edition of this game is because the pre-orders, limited and one day editions are the only copies that came with the Japanese voice overs, Sephiroth summon, white chocobo, glow moogle and red bonnetberry. The English voice over for the original copy of the game is terrible! There were a handful of English voice over characters that made me cringe. Characters talk throughout the game not just during cuts scenes, so having the desired voice over for me was important. Now I can finally enjoy this game with much better voice acting and Sephiroth by my side.

It's hard to recommend games as everyone has a specific genre and style, but if you have been playing Final Fantasy in the very beginning then you will enjoy playing this game. I've never been into Pokemon/Digimon type games, but I am immersed with this game. The storyline is good, I particularly enjoy Lann's character, he always makes me laugh. Overall a great game for me to play before bed, just run around collecting new mirages.",1522713600,5

6685,1243,1145,"I loved this game on Xbox 360. Then had a PS4 for awhile and bought it since I hadn't bought any of the DLC for the Xbox 360 version and this includes all of it, added to the game too. Meaning no downloads or trying to decide when to start the DLC. This game will make you think of GTA at times, it will take you back to Shenmue at times and with a more current game series, Yakuza. There's a lot of collectibles, some of it's silly like buying upgrades for your player houses that include a giant fish tank. Driving is a fairly big part of this game but it definitely doesn't have the driving mechanics GTA has. One thing to know since I have seen it come up is the fighting. This is game is nowhere near as gun based as GTA. You do a lot of hand to hand fighting, including against groups of enemies. It's a fun, somewhat challenging game. In a lot of ways, I hope they make a sequel to it or at least carry this style of game over into a new series.",1522800000,5
6686,1284,2844,"I purchased  two of these Hori protectors from seller JADD ENTERTAINMENT with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This is the third out of four PS Vita Slim protector brands I have tried. This Hori failed me just like the brands Gam3Gear and Akwox. Only the brand Mr Shield did everything I wanted from any screen protector. Anyways, I read the comments and watched videos of how to apply this Hori screen protector so I came prepared. I used a strong electric air blower and a keyboard vacuum during the whole installation process. I wanted to make sure no dust was anywhere on the device screens. I even made sure to blow dry the underside that you are suppose to peel off, steps 2 and 3 backing sheets. So when it is slowly being peeled off it hopefully wouldn't drop any dust particles all over the screen when the protector starts to adhere onto the device. Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 process was a pain for the first PS Vita device I installed this on. There was a lot of particles that got caught when the two backing got peeled off, sigh. I had to use scotch tape onto the protector to lift it and remove the particles stuck under the actual screen protector. It was not a fun process. On the second device was the same but this time there was a rainbow effect on the underside of the screen protector. I completely forgot to take a photo as the whole process stressed me out. No matter how much I pressed the protector, the rainbow effect just wouldn't go away. I ended up applying a different protector (Mr Shield) on the second device that worked so much better and took less than 3 minutes to apply. I will be removing this Hori protector off the first device as I don't feel it will protect my screen at all. Waste of $30 for 2 of these terrible Hori film ""protectors"".

This protector is also not edge to edge size as I was hoping for. It is also one of the thinnest screen protector I have ever come across... so thin you wonder if it'll even protect anything. It's thinner than the protective backing that you peel off the protector during application. It also has an annoying straight line in the middle of the protector from the peel off backing. It comes in 2 separate backing film that you peel right then the left (steps 2 and 3). Step 1 is a tab you peel off the back and it's what you use to stick onto the screen while you align the protector. This step 1 was useless because as you start peeling off the backing, the whole protector starts to move around even when you are firmly pressing it down. The only positive things I can say about this protector is how invisible it looks once applied and how easy it was to get the bubbles out. The thinness of this item is what makes it look seamless and almost invisible. The question is, how much will it actually protect your screen? This is literally like the film you find on brand new electronic devices when you first buy them that protects it from fingerprints... even though this Hori still catches fingerprints like crazy.

For the price and only getting one thin film type ""protector"" per kit, I'd look elsewhere if you are serious about keeping your screen from any serious scratches.

ETA: I decided to play with my Vita before removing this Hori protector. I didn't like the feel of the protector at all, had a very semi-rough cheap film feeling to it. There was some missed touch screen responses that had me worried that it might of been my brand new Vita, but come to find out it wasn't soon as I did the Welcome Park app. The line that I mention in my original review was annoyingly visible during gameplays that had white/light colored backgrounds. It's hard to capture a close up picture of the imperfections unless you see them in person. Even after my hard work of almost 2 hours of applying this protector on two different Vitas, there was still so many imperfections underneath the protector. Removing the two film backing while it adheres to the screen is such a major flaw imo, so many dust will fall... just look closely and use a flashlight if you already own this protector. The screen looks better without this protector on. The feel, middle line and collected dust outweighs the esthetic of ""invisible"" look of this protector. Extremely disappointed with this product and have no idea why so many praised it.",1522800000,1
6687,1371,2845,"Look, you're ether the kind of person who is going to ""get"" this type of game or you're not. Don't listen to all the bad press, don't believe the hype, it's all harmless fun. I think people on BOTH sides of the debate on games like this are taking thing WAY too seriously. It's not even a ""sex"" game, it's really just a COMEDY game... with a little sex thrown in. It honestly has made me laugh out loud several times, it's so crazy. Having said that, it's a lot of silly fun with tons of content, online play, and customization options. The gameplay DOES get repetitive though. It's basically: cut scene, hack & slash a few hundred enemies & 1-3 ""bosses"", blast your opponents out of their clothes, cut scene, repeat...

6695,1243,1939,"I remember the first time I played a Dark Souls game, it was Demon Souls and I thought it was the most clunky, frustrating action/RPG I had ever played. But if you're familiar with the series, you know what I'm going to say. I just had to figure it out. I had to make it work right. I then spent a couple of months laboring away at and understanding the series.

Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin was my third Dark Souls game and I thoroughly enjoy it but it's missing something, isn't it? Either that or I've figured these games out. I've not, I can still go back to Demon's Souls and get my butt handed to me. This is a fun game, it's really a better place to start than Dark Souls or Demons Souls just because you're not likely to get as frustrated and mad at this one. There's a part of me that doesn't even know if this series is in my top 5 favorite or top 5 most hated. I get a new Dark Souls game and let it set there. Looking at me. Knowing the beating it will give me but not Dark Souls II. Lots of weapons, lots of bosses (not as impressive as the others in the series), great atmosphere in all these games. A tip from someone who hates spoilers and who doesn't like multiplayer games. You can summon someone to help you if stuck. I hate that! Why do I need help? I'll play it 1,000 times! So, yeah, not for sure if I love it or hate it. I will say I buy every Dark Souls game and have played through all them without needing to summon any help. It has added gray to my beard and taken years off my life but it can be done. I'm also sort of kidding about the hatred part. After awhile you either quit or just accept that you're going to get killed over and over until that one perfect moment when you do something right and make it. It reminds me of older video games. Kind of like the difficulty and frustration of the old Mega Man and Castlevania games. Last, this one isn't near as hard. My son (12 at the time) beat it and he won't even hardly play the others. Good series to test your patience and luck too.",1522800000,4
6696,1243,577,"I'm kind of a strange zombie-gamer. I like zombies, like them even more when I'm shooting them or swinging a baseball bat at them but a lot of the zombie-based games don't interest me. That's not the case with Dying Light: The Following. This and oddly enough ""7 Days to Die"" are my favorite zombie games. Dying Light is more than a typical zombie game. There's quite a bit of exploring, complete with the timed/rushed feeling, there's parkour, kind of like playing Assassin's Creed without the restraints. It's a lot of fun to play by yourself. I think that's why a lot of zombie games don't interest as much. Seems like most are multiplayer. It's hard to believe but you can get a solid 100 hours out of this version of Dying Light. It's one of my top underrated games of the current generation.",1522800000,5

6728,360,418,Vita fits perfectly a little to tight i'm worried that my skin will wear off sooner because of it. You can only carry 4 games in this case which is very low in comparison to other cases. It is indestructible and far more sturdy than my switch case.,1522886400,3
6729,1432,686,Bought this to use on my pc. Cord ended up getting a short in about a month. And the port for the charger on the controller is loose now.,1522886400,3
6730,1435,1183,best mouse ive had. had a steel series with 2 buttons on the side and a razor death adder but the buttons on the side weren't in a comfortable position for me. this mouse feels better in the hand and has more features including controlling the weight and the precision button on the side for slowing sensitivity when u need it,1522886400,5
6731,1243,1093,"I've always thought Rockstar was one-step from making GTA into a perfect game but they always had to get too cute with GTA. Not with RDR, even the Undead DLC is a ton of fun. What's more fun than jumping on an automatic mounted chain-machine gun and mowing down hordes of zombies? I think a big part of the fun with RDR is the main character John. Unlike GTA, especially V, you don't feel a polarizing feeling towards John. The story and his backstory draws you in. You could be just like him .. you know, if you lived in the old west. You're going to get attached to the character, his family and you'll even enjoy the parts that normally would feel repetitive. I will say Skyrim and Fallout are also good at doing this. All video games, in my 30+ years of gaming, become boring. They drag. It's going to happen but if the developer can make you feel like you're accomplishing something for your character, you don't notice it as much. RDR does that. I'll give an example with GTA. I really like the GTA games but I eventually get tired of ""playing by the rules"". Like when GTA San Andreas had you destroying the comic book guy's remote helicopter toys and you had to use a remote helicopter toy to do it. In RDR, there's no real restrictions, if you can kill those legendary animals with a knife, have at it. Want to throw dynamite at them? You can. Or you find them from a distance, get your Carcano Rifle out and try to snipe the elusive beast.

My teenage son said it best, ""Everything in it feels epic"". I think that's what makes this game so great. From the side challenges like trying to skin X amount of a certain wild animal to trying to poke a knife between your fingers in a QTE game to my personal favorite moment of the game. You've just realized you have a bunch of animal skins to sell but haven't saved. Then you hear it. The sound of a cougar attacking. Those will kill you before you can get your gun pulled, kill your horse too. It's such a fun, intense moment in a usually mid-paced game. The characters throughout the game are either crazy or hilarious or both. Just wait until you have to run behind the bank and hunt the critters. It's a relatively violent, harsh game that doesn't use gore or shock to make it violent. It's almost like an old west simulator. I've had Red Dead Redemption 2 preordered since last summer. Even worse, I decided to switch from the XB1 to PS4, so now I'm going to have to cancel my XB1 preorder and preorder it on PS4. I would rate it as one of the greatest games ever made. The game that comes the closest in old west style is Gun. Nowhere near as challenging as RDR but similar gameplay and setting. By the way, it works great on BC. I've played it all the way through twice on 360, once on XB1 BC and wouldn't be surprised if I try it on PS Now.",1522886400,5
6732,1433,170,Not much to say about it.,1522886400,4
6733,1432,1182,Was comfortable and worked well. Only problem being my dog pulled the cord and t fell about 3 feet and shattered one ear cuff.,1522886400,4

I forgot that the controls are so very wonky, characters are awkward and difficult to manage in normal condition, leave alone surviving a shootout with hungry zombies.  I feel strongly that software ports to modern systems should include options to tweak controls if desired, or keep them as the original game provided.  This happens with ports of many games and it is disappointing, especially given the sophistication of modern game controllers.  Not the game's fault though.  Fair warning.",1523404800,3

(This advice goes for buying the original game carts should you find them in the wild.) Oh, and the original carts won't work on 3DS or regular DS.

Play wise the game lets you equip each of Link's hands with a weapon or item rather than just one optional item plus your sword. You can even with the right combination taking running jumps! Or just jump. The other GB games are similar but I think they were developed by Capcom.",1523404800,3

6978,1406,2916,"I genuinely love my this thing, and it makes playing games on my TV super awesome and comfortable, but there were a few minor gripes that i shared with most people, but they are super easy to address and get over if you're willing to put in just a little effort to make a great idea of a product with a pretty spot on execution that much better. Corsair just missed the mark on a couple things, but what manufacturer doesn't? For me, the lapdog was the best option to game as i currently don't have room for a desk for my PC, but eventually will, and wanted to solid keyboard/mouse that I didn't want to upgrade from until long in the future. I got the k70 before knowing about the lapdog, and saw it after purchasing the keyboard and had to have it. Then I saw the reviews on it, and at a glance, they're pretty scary with a lot of them being 1-3 stars. But they were mostly over magnets not staying in, or occasional connections issues (I've experienced a grand total of 2 connections issues since October but unplugging the power/usb cable at the lapdog immediately solved it) and the biggest complaint I've seen was the lack of wrist rest.
I actually got mine on newegg because it was cheaper at the time of purchase, but I'm posting here to share what I've done to improve my overall experience with my lapdog in hopes that it will help someone else see past the bad reviews to see this things potential like I did. Or if a current owner comes back to leave a review or check some troubleshooting tips, this might help shed new light on the matter.

First - Biggest complaint from people, and rightfully so, was the lack of wrist rest. But Corsair includes one already! Albeit, its the rest that comes with the keyboard itself, but it's still there, and its not doing anything after you put it into the lapdog anyway. Disassemble it by unscrewing the screws on the bottom, and take the top textured portion and secure it to the aluminum piece of the lapdog at the bottom of the keyboard with double sided tape, it should fit perfectly there. I STRONGLY recommend 3M's extreme mounting tape or their exterior mounting tape.

Second - If you want the best comfort, order a replacement wrist rest from Corsair to use for the mouse pad portion. They can be found on Corsair's website for around $10. Cut it to length and do the same thing as above (i left the 2 screws at the bottom of the mouse pad out and replaced with magnets, but its not 100% necessary as the top 2 screws hold everything tight enough)

Third - play around with the position of the foam pad, i find myself flipping it one way or the other depending on where/how I'm sitting

Fourth - If you have loose ports (I only had 1, but others complain about all of them) then take the cover off the USB but under the mouse pad, and gently pry the tabs on the USB ports to allow them more grip on your USB devices.

as a side note, if you've got a version of Windows that allows you to sign in with one of those fingerprint readers, i recommend getting a small USB base one and populating one of the ports on the side of the lapdog with it. Makes signing in all the bit faster and easier.

Anyway, I hope this helps!",1523491200,5

6980,1461,2917,"Short version:
Status: Returned after a few minutes of using.
Reason: I can hear a buzzing sound when the mic is turned on.

Long version:
Sound: the sound itself is definitely better than most headphones of this price. So that's definitely a win.
Mic quality: from my testing (using Discord), the mic quality is not too loud or quiet. The sound is clear.
Ease of use: easy. USB Plug and play and you're done.
Downside: I can hear an constant electronic buzzing sound. I tested every way possible and turns out the sound only happens when the mic is enabled and in use. For example, during voice chat if I disable the mic, the buzzing is gone. Yes, I checked the volume setting and everything. I tested it on every USB port on 2 different Windows 10 machines, same exact behaviors.
I had my roommate tested it as well (to make sure I wasn't just hearing things) and it took him 5 minutes of me constantly turning mic off and on in a quiet room for him to notice it. And he's not annoyed by it, but I was (hence returned).
My quick search for solution tells me that it's common among USB headphones... though my roommate's headphones (different model and brand) don't produce the buzzing sound.

Edit:
This may or may not be a faulty product. It may just be that this specific model doesn't satisfy my expectations for headphones and, thus, I requested for refund.
This is not a problem with the seller (who has been bugging me to change this review several times over the months), but it is the product itself that I am not satisfied with.",1523491200,3

I wasn't expecting much because this game was roasted by critics on release in 2015.  There were so many awesome PS4 releases that year (Bloodborne, Witcher, Fallout) that it kind of got lost in the crowd.

Its not terrible. The vehicle combat is fun. But honestly its not great either.  Voice acting is awful, controls are jank, and theres barely any replayability.

I held out for a while because I never played the Souls series so wasn't sure I would appreciate it on the same level.  Finally picked up a cheap copy to see what all the hype is about.

Wow.  Five hours in now and I just don't understand what makes this an incredible game to so many people.  It reminds me of the Darksiders series.  A run of the mill hack and slash on rails with a high skill ceiling but not much in terms of narrative or exploration.  The graphics also have not aged well for a 2015 release.  Despite this games incredible popularity there has been no remaster or 4K update for PS Pro.  Most other exclusives got one so this seems a really odd omission by Sony.

Maybe my expectations were just too high.  To me this isn't even a fun way to kill a few hours on a weeknight.  The time you need to invest to get gud and actually enjoy this game just isn't worth it in my opinion.",1523664000,1

7080,677,611,"I miss the days you could pop a disc in, type in a product key, and you were ready to play within 30 or so minutes. No internet connection, no online authentication, no proprietary game launchers. Just the game you bought and you. Bought this game for my wife and it is a damn nightmare to get it up and running. So many problems, I couldn't believe it. Let me break it down.

1. You need to set up an Origin account. This one isn't the worst, but I find it annoying that I need to create an EA login and password just to play a game I bought. I don't plan on using Origin for anything else, so this is definitely an inconvenience.

2. Origin constantly crashes. I tried installing this on my wife's computer, which is windows 10. Origin would crash a few seconds after launching so I tried a few things - restarted the PC, checked for any updates, checked drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled Origin. Nothing worked. Tried googling the problem and it seems to be a common occurrence - Origin does not play nice with windows 10. So I tried launching Origin through compatibility modes for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. None of them were stable. They all crashed. Great. I then tried installing it on MY laptop, which is still windows 7 by default and after a few brief crashes, it finally loaded the store and let me type in the product code. THANK GOODNESS.

3. There is no way to install from the DVD that came with the game. When you insert the disc, an autolaunch window pops up telling you to install Origin, set up EA account, and then install Sims 4. Ok. I did the first two things....let me install Sims 4. But it won't. There are no options. If you click continue, it will just try to install Origin again. So you close it, pop the disc out, pop it in....and it loops the same prompts. Install Origin, Set up account...I GET IT. I already did those things. SO...I look through my Origin launcher for options. Nothing about installing from disc, only lets you download. Great. Now I gotta wait HOURS for this thing to download 10 gigs of data so I can play the game I ALREADY BOUGHT AND HAVE A DVD INSTALL DISC FOR. What a waste of time.

Don't bother with this crap. Just play the old games. EA is too worried about making sure the costumer jumps through hoops to authenticate their purchase that it just is not worth it in the end. Never again",1523836800,1

7084,1284,343,"Ever since I purchased a PS Vita PCH-2001 (USA/NA) version, I've been eyeing this aqua blue PCH-2000 (Japan) version like a hawk. The last two digits after each PS Vita numbers are region codes; example PCH-2001 is 01 USA code, PCH-2000 is 00 Japan code etc. I'm seeing some reviewers who have the PCH-2006 and little do these consumers know that the product they received from some of these sellers are the Asia 06 Hong Kong/Korea code version. I have no issues with any PS Vita versions, but I like to get what I actually paid for, and in this case I strictly wanted the Japanese aqua blue. You can also tell if it's the Japanese version during your first initial setup of the device, it will default to Tokyo.

I took a chance and made a purchase from seller cus mart with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon) of same day delivery. Everything arrived on time and the product came in BRAND NEW SEALED boxed. The PS Vitas in Japan are still in production and they actually do not have clear seals. The seller I purchased from added them as extra security and I'm very grateful. All PS Vitas are region free so I'm able to enjoy all of my new physical and digital games on this device. This device only comes stocked with 1GB internal memory, so I went ahead and purchased a 64gb from the same seller and they did not disappoint. Extremely happy with my new PS Vita, it's an absolute beauty in person! It's hard to describe how stunning the color of this device is as I noticed in different lighting it will either look darker or lighter. The entire body except for the back touchpad is all matte finish so no fingerprints - yeay!

The X and O button functions on the Japanese versions are reversed and can easily be changed in the accessibility menu under settings. I recommend just leaving the X and O on default as it's only reversed on the LiveArea screen. Once a USA/NA game starts it defaults to what western gamers are accustomed to, X=confirm, O=cancel/back. You can also login to any PSN region you have, but be aware only one account per PS Vita, blame Sony. If you have multiple PS Vita proprietary memory cards, you can set each memory card with a different PSN, again blame Sony. Other than that, this PCH-2000 version functions just like the USA/NA PCH-2001 version. For those curious, my model version came stocked with 3.65 firmware. If you are looking for firmware below this, it is best to ask the seller of your choice as these are still in production and very popular in Japan.",1523836800,5

But the Overwatch design is nice, and they're functional I suppose. The orange braided cable with volume control is nice. For $100 don't waste your time with these, spend the extra $50 and get something with better build quality. The sound quality isn't really there either. I had trouble listening for footsteps in-game (Overwatch ironically) and pinpointing location as well as my G4ME Zero/G4ME One headsets. I've had a MUCH better experience with cheaper HyperX headsets like the Cloud I and Cloud II. If you're on a budget I'd recommend going with HyperX over these but if you want a really high quality headset you will likely have to spend more than this.",1523923200,3

The open-world sections felt surprisingly limited and unnecessary, and I wasn't given the impression that I was given as much choice in approaching encounters with the level of freedom that the franchise is known for. In general the action is stylish and competent--but since this genre of game has lots of competition, it needed something more. I found the game easy to beat, even on Hard; the last boss was a total push-over. Grab it if it's on sale or you need a cyber-punk fix.",1524009600,3

7133,157,305,"To start off this game has far to many 5 star reviews while the game itself is just a prime example of Nintendo again deciding to rest on their laurels. I also find it incredibly egregious that Nintendo constantly finds the need to make something like an FPS kiddie and cute. It would be nice if Nintendo would put more effort into marketing titles like Mad World and No More heroes better.

First of all paint mechanic aside this is basically just an FPS with a paint mechanic and chock full of Nintendo tropes so if you are a FPS fan go to another console, this title will not satisfy your trigger hungry thumbs. However since it is Nintendo there is a lot of fun to be had with this title, the single player campaign is fun albeit to short. While I know the Wii-U is very much a dead system I had no problem finding a match online.

At the end of the day it's fun there's nothing original here and it is clearly Nintendo trying to break into the e-sports market",1524009600,3

The graphics, tone, sense of wonder, emotion, and exploration is intensely gratifying. Is it perfect? No, it has a scope issue (in that there's long periods where nothing of note happens), and disappointing boss fights and lack of classic Zelda gadgets, but it makes up for it with the sense of liberation it gives you as the player. This game does what old school games did all the time ... it puts you into the shoes of the hero, and lets your imagination fill in the blanks.",1524009600,5

The levels are boring and bland, there's too much walking around between action, the sound/music is bad, the story is completely nonsensical ... pretty much everything else you'd want in a video game is mediocre to bad, actually. Maybe I'm missing the joke, but that shouldn't blow the experience, right? But, the action is bonkers, and a lot of fun--so I guess it's a trade-off. Good for a quick playthrough but I wouldn't expect to get too much out of this one.",1524096000,3
7148,1486,495,"As close to being a cave-man as I'll probably ever be, which is a good thing. Overall this game was a lot of fun. It sticks to the Far Cry model closely, which in my opinion is not by default a good thing, because you'll basically be doing the same thing over and over again; however, I found the environments and gameplay very evocative. The developers put a lot of attention into creating a vibrant prehistoric world, and it paid off. I loved the sound design and languages. There were some balancing issues for difficulty--once I got the sabre-toothed tiger and cave bear the game pretty much went on autopilot, but it didn't ruin things for me. A solid purchase if you want some brutal, stone-spear throwin', shaman trance goin', beast ridin' action.",1524096000,4

7166,518,823,"First of the game looks amazing and the characters are awesome especially the random NPCs, but its all ruined by bad game design. Theres no difficulty to speak of outside of running into a Lynel early in the game that can one hit you. Once you can take a hit you don't have to worry anymore because you can just down a potion/food after every hit if you want because you have a grocery store full of the stuff without even trying. Theres 120 shrines that most are just short puzzles, and you need to find them all if you want the classic green tunic, but only 5 dungeons. 4 of which are just like 4 shrines attach to each other. Only 6 both fights, 4 of which are just slight variants of each others and none of them are as hard as the white Lynels.

7173,1018,2961,"A gorgeous, emotional, fast-paced and thoughtful installment in the God of War series.

Kratos is still the beastly and enraged protagonist we all know and love, but this series adds a totally different dimension to his character: Being a dad. It is simply fascinating to watch Kratos rip off the head of an enemy in one scene, and then sternly--yet softly--instruct his son how to be a warrior the next. There are even moments in the game when Kratos has to resist showing too much affection towards his teachable, but fallible, sidekick. Teaching him too softly, he reasons, will not serve him well going forward.

On that note, Atreus is hardly a burden. His quick wit and fiery dedication to Kratos makes him a surprisingly useful and fun companion. Not once have I felt like he was in the way or unnecessary to the mission at hand, nor does utilizing his skills to fend off foes interrupt your present concerns/encounters. In fact, as you will find out, you will struggle to defeat certain enemies without him.

The story is clearer and engaging than past entries, with the transitions between cutscenes and gameplay a totally seamless experience. The action ramps up quickly, the puzzles are challenging and rewarding, and the landscape is worth exploring.

This is all I will say for now. This is an experience worth playing to be believed!",1524182400,5
7174,1492,2284,"Works perfectly, came with storage card, cords, 2 controllers, free games! What could be better?",1524182400,5
7175,110,2961,"One of the best (if not the best) games of this console generation so far.

This is a dark, mature action adventure game that will last around ~20-30 hour game (with no filler content) depending on how much you explore, and difficulty level you selected with emphasis on quality over quantity.

The game has a very nice pacing/progression system that feels very natural. The game does not hand hold you, or set you to your own devices; rather gives you enough information to figure things out on your own

Different from past God of War (GOW) games is that, this game is a over shoulder 3rd person view vs isometric view (camera with birds eye view panning in and out). The camera is very tight fixed, and behind kratos making it more grounded and personal. Entire game is pretty much one-shot (assuming you don't get any game over screen).

The game has beautiful environment and the lighting is very impressive. It runs
1080p 30fps on PS4 (original or slim)
4k 30fps, and performance mode 1080 60fps (dips at times) on the PS4 Pro

If you play on PS4 pro it's preferred you play at 30fps. The combat this time around is less combo based than past games, and more methodical as it's more about precision hits, quick turns*, and dodging; being aware of your surroundings due to the fixed over the shoulder view. So 60fps is not really necessary unless maybe you're playing on the hardest difficulty mode.
 * For quick turns there's a learning curve to keep form being disoriented during right corridors.

Sound is amazing. Get your headset or home theater system ready because you're in for a treat as the game has really nice surround sound option. Does not support 3D audio in the PlayStation Platinum headset which is disapointing. Hope they add it in, in the future.

Music typical for GOW games with drums, string instruments and orchestral vocals that really gets you pumped up

There are some audio ques that help unlock hidden items so keep an ear out

Interaction/dialogue with kratos and his son feel very real and not dialed in or exaggerated. very nice banter between the two and other characters as well

-Story:
As mentioned before, very mature yet dark. The story is more narrative driven and has more character development than past games where you're just full of rage and kill everything in sight. Each character has complex motivations in what they're set out to do

Takes place in Norse mythology instead of Geek

The main plot is that Kratos' wife has died and she wants her ashes spread from the highest mountain

Kratos takes his son with him on this journey and through a bonding experience they both grow stronger as they reach their final destination. the journey isn't that simple as it seems as there are twist and turns along the way and enemies they have to face

You do get some insight on how Kratos reach this land after GOW3, but it's sprinkled throughout instead of one long exposition

 Side quests brings out lore of the game and also way to upgrade your skill tree

There are boat sections in the game where Kratos gives his son life lessons, conversely his son gives inside knowledge of the world he learned through observation/what he learned from his mother; which makes you more invested in the characters.

-Gameplay
The combat has a lot of layers/options to it.

Instead of Quick Timed Events (QTE) there's a stun meter which which needs to be filled up for kratos make his signature final finishing moves on enemies. Feels very natural as you don't get a huge button prompt the middle of the screen

I like how the core combat is mapped to the trigger buttons instead of the face buttons making combat feel more natural

There's a skill tree that cater to how you want to play: defensive, offensive, focus on physical or magical attacks, range vs close combat, master a weapon over the other, etc

You can upgrade weapons and armor by collecting materials

Kratos' main weapon this time around is the leviathan axe (very similar to Thor's (Marvel movies/comics) weapon Mjolnir)  instead of his chained blades of chaos. You can throw the axe and have it call back to you like a boomerang. You can swing and throw the axe at enemies and fun to master as you have to judge the timing of when the axe will return to you as without your axe you may only have your bare fists to do battle till it comes back

There is some strategy involved especially in the higher difficulty settings. Some enemies are super effective against certain weapons/skills you have to be aware of

Krato's son comes along with you on the journey and is able to help with by stunning/detract enemies with an arrow which you can control the activation. Overtime as he becomes more experienced in combat more options are available. He'll also yell out tips when needed** or jump onto enemies to slow them down. Also you can view his journals after you defeat an enemy to find out hidden weaknesses

**Seeing the camera is so tight, he'll give you tips you are not able to see at times due to blind spots

Armor and clothes can be crafted, purchased, or upgraded via dwarf blacksmiths in game . It changes krato's physical appearance in game. Some armor/clothing piece has slots for enchantments which effects stats

Enemies attack you gorilla style as they can attack at anytime they want instead of gathering up in a circle and attacking one by one. Each enemy have different variety of skills, health, size, weakness and speed

There are backtracking at times that builds on exploration. Also the environments sometimes change when going back making the location feel different yet the same. There's also hidden areas you cannot access until you get a particular item giving the game this somewhat of a metriod-mania style to it

Through mini objectives like kills specific about of enemies to get exp rewards

Side quest gives you glimpse of story narrative, exp gain and or material. It doesn't feel like fetch quests or something you have to do to directly upgrade your character . There's no fluff and the side quests does not feel tacked on as it feels necessary, yet optional

You'll naturally stumble onto some side quests as the map only shows an overview of the land with a compass that points you to your main objective. Fast travel is limited, making exploration in the forefront. There's not too many side quests making it feel open and direct at the same time

As of this review, this is best PS4 game in my opinion. Sets a new standard for video games",1524182400,5

I already owned it (of course), for many years.
I bought a cart dumper/patch tool that plugs in like a game genie.
I patched in new boards (which you may find on the internet, free, without breaking laws if you download the board sets).
I played many different iterations of the game with new levels, new secrets, sometimes new graphics etc.
It's like being in heaven already.  Don't miss out.
Super UFO Pro 8 device will be able to take downloaded IPS patches on a flash card and patch the game and still save to the cart.
Just make sure your game is CLEAN before use!  A little alcohol & a Q-Tip goes a LONG way for cleaning purposes.

No parts of this instruction(s) constitutes breaking any DMCA laws or other similar laws regarding download, use, or execution!  Board sets are freely available on various places, just search Super Metroid Hacking, or Super Mario World hacking and you'll find tools, board sets, and everything.  Just don't download ROMS from the world wide web... that's not cool, you may *NOT* do that at any point, even if you own it.
Buy the game and a Super UFO Pro 8 if you want to use your games on PC or mod your SNES games, or backup saved-games too, like:
Super Metroid (new levels)
Super Mario World / All Stars (new levels)
Super Mario Kart (new tracks!)
Final Fantasy II or III or Secret of Mana (or it's sequel)  (new translations, 9 item patch for SoM)
Dragon Warrior 3, 5, or 6 (japan imports).  (translations to english)
etc

Must use with a genuine or top-quality SNES controller.  Don't use a generic one or you will die.  A LOT.

Usually after market batteries (not necessarily from KMD) don't last very long (I've been through several PSP batteries that die after only 2-3 hours when my old worn-out Sony original lasts 4-5). This KMD battery has lasted 8.5 hours on my AGS-001 and is still going on the first charge! I'm highly impressed and will be buying their DS Lite version. This battery has breathed new life into one of my favorite portable systems. I don't know how long it'll last on the AGS-101 but if it lasts this long with the front light I imagine the backlit version will last a great amount of time as well.",1524268800,5
7219,1503,2968,"As a launch title for the Kinect, This game was pretty decent. It's basically just 5 mini games in 1. 20,000 Leaks, River Rush, Rally Ball, Reflex Ridge and Space Pop. As you can probably tell from the artwork on the case, the game uses pre-made avatars as the characters in the game, though you're not able to use your own avatar which was somewhat disappointing. The main mode of the game is Adventure mode where you play a set number of mini games in order to get medals so that you can move on to the other levels. All of the mini games in the Adventure mode are the same, the only difference is the layout as well as the main goal. For instance, One level may have you collecting a certain number of pins while another level will require you to race through it in a set time limit. There are about 4 different difficulties in Adventure mode. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and The Ultimate Treasure. Each difficulty is locked until you beat the previous one. Beginner is almost like a tutorial letting you get a feel for things while all of the other ones challenge your reflexes and reaction speed. I only made it past the intermediate difficulty, but this game does give you a really good workout, and it's way more fun than walking on a boring treadmill. I just wish that it had more mini games included because the ones that are on there do get boring after a while.",1524268800,3

Pros:
Enemy and animal AI is decent and responds rationally to Lara
Good 4K performance on PS4 Pro
Controller layout makes sense
Good range of difficulty settings
Just the like 2013 release, each zone has its own list of collectibles and challenges

Cons:
Same weapons, same skills, same kill animations, heck even basically the same enemies as the 2013 Tomb Raider.  Feels like a DLC.
NPC voice acting is atrocious.  Also the same guy reads ALL the journal entries (spanning many cultures and characters) which is a bit jarring.
Absurdly silly plot
Jank swimming controls lead to a lot of drowning death reloads

Again, not a terrible game but uninspired and a bit lazy by Crystal Dynamics.  I get the if it aint broke argument, but at least give us some new mechanics to play with.  This really is the same game with a slight graphical facelift.",1524441600,3
