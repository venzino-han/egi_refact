7259,481,861,"This one is fun and easy to play. It has 10 levels with a number of challenges as in so many items in a certain time, no hints , no errors. You will earn them in each level. It's a game the whole family will enjoy playing. There's no objectionable content to find, no violent or bloody things, no ghosts or the like. Just plain clean enjoyment for all.",1524441600,5
7260,1436,508,Love the story mode. It didn't even feel like I was even playing a sports game at all,1524441600,5
7261,1510,424,The system would keep clicking when I put in a disc and does not read any discs at all.,1524441600,1
7262,1511,980,I really enjoy playing all my old games on it,1524441600,5
7263,1510,1488,Classic game that works great and is enjoyable to play!,1524441600,4
7264,1509,745,"S-Video is the best option for you nN64 without modding it, and the video looks good enough for me. N64 games look great on my xRGB mini with scanlines through s-video. Great product, great price!",1524441600,5
7265,781,2979,"If you played the first Dishonored then this will feel very familiar to you. I find overall that I can pretty much complete everything by simply sneaking around and using blink - much as I did in the first game (with some other abilities thrown in on occasion just for variety). This is an evolution in gameplay (not a dramatic revolution) although there are some nice improvements overall:

> Graphics have been enhanced as you would expect from the previous installment.
> There are new enhancements to abilities if you're playing as Corvo (and entirely new abilities if you're playing as Emily.)
> The world of Karnaca is brighter than the dark, gritty world of the first game.
> The levels are generally much larger than they were in the first game with lots to explore - but levels are still linear overall. This is not an open world game which would allow you to find quests and complete them at your leisure.

Personally, I enjoy the game quite a bit, but even so I'll get bored if I play it for a long time. I'll typically do a level or two at a sitting and come back later. Of course, I'm a bit of a completionist so I'm typically exploring every nook and cranny of each level which can take quite a while given the size of the levels.",1524441600,4
7266,1319,718,"The first issue is the lack of healing items until the store unlocks via crystal gathering.  I didn't unlock the store until my characters were around level 30.  Ironically once you get the store you don't have to worry about healing items dropping minus the better ones to use for boss battles since basic berries only heal 500 hp.

Second issue would be the mages having limited actions.  They can only act once per turn.  Using an item or ultimate attack also counts idiotically.  And once you unlock their level 2 spells they can't act for 2 turns.

3rd issue would be most of the character classes are pretty useless.  Whip does garbage damage and doesn't have larger aoe like the class description says.  If whip users cost less to attack and had full screen that would make up for their weak damage.  Lancer is said to have the largest range in their class description but then whips says they have larger range than lancers so that's already a huge mistake. Lancers don't have bigger aoe than most of the classes.  I'd say it's about as big as ice mages or whips and that's it.

Fencer (dumb name since the class specializes in bulky swords and does no fencing whatsoever) has the largest aoe of the weapons classes I have seen next to grenade launcher. Increased depending on the skill and sword equipped since some skills and swords have further reach.
Wind mage seems to have the largest range of the bunch since it can suck in most enemies grouping them to the middle with their 2nd spell.  Until then they are horrible and many mid sized enemies and the mine enemies are resistant to their element.

Dungeons are copy pasted and the 2d platforming makes traversing them a huge pain when you can fall down after missing a jump or not using the dk style shooting mechanic by a sliver.

Class changing and equipment is entirely random so there are many times where my characters go without upgrading equipment for multiple dungeons.  So far only my fire mage and the main character have access to more than 1 class while most of the others don't even have access to a second class as of yet.  Skills and class changing can be randomly unlocked for active battle party members and also level if the character you learned it from has theirs leveled.",1524441600,3

7272,1319,1302,"Social links are prettymuch locked out till ng+, character movement is the worst of any srpg I have ever played, guide dang it to recruit some characters and get the good ending, enemies get far more turns than the player does and there are typically 10 or more while you are limited to 5 units at a time typically.

Mediocre at best and it's pathetic that atlus released this with their atlus tax when they couldn't be bothered to even fix equipment and items inaccurate translations.",1524441600,2

7293,1513,347,"Great story driven game.  I had a lot of fun. Creative and highly entertaining.  If you like this game, make sure you check out Quantum Break on xbox one. It's a newer game from the same developers. Mind blowing good.",1524528000,5

7296,133,2961,Best game of all time to date. I really fell in love with this game when I first heard it was coming out.  It has the most enhanced graphics of any game to date.  The gameplay and story line are so amazing that even the gods would be proud.  I have never played such an addictive game in my life. It is a must play for any God of War fans and basically all true gamers.  Fun to the max and epic thrills await in God of War 4.,1524528000,5
7297,294,2986,A great horror classic for the PS2. For anyone loves Japanese survival horror. Definitely a rare gem nowadays.,1524528000,5
7298,91,539,This collection comes with NO DLC! N- O- N- E. Its a perfect example of how greedy and careless Microsoft is as opposed to Sony. I can say it's LESS BUGGY than the PS3 collection and BOOTS and LOADS FASTER as well.,1524528000,3
7299,1513,1173,Dirt 2 break grounds and a huge step up from the  original.  I remember spending hours drifting in Evo an STi. Check out dirt 4 which is the latest released with the VR option if you are into this kind of games.,1524528000,4
7300,294,2987,"I like it very much but I would definitely say it's not for everybody. The controller handles are VERY different from a regular xbox one controller. It was very hard to get used to. Buttons are pretty loud and the triggers are VERY VERY sensitive, but it fulfills its purpose and I'm able to still play games without a problem.",1524528000,5

7302,1371,558,"Really cool figure of Alice from the terrible Tim Burton's reboot/sequel (deboot?). The movie was lame but the toy is cool.  I've said it before, I love the art style of Disney's Infinity figures and this one is no exception and stands out as particularly eye catching. It's a shame we'll never get Alice from the original animated movie, but this is a nice backup. It doesn't look anything like ""what's-her-name"" from the movies, but if you ask  me that's probably a good thing...",1524614400,5

7335,1066,2200,"I got this game as a gift on the year it was released. The price for it back then was $34.99, and I still love this game. This is by far the best Mario Party game out for the Nintendo handheld systems. It can be played with 2-4 players on a single game card through download play. I've played with my Nephew, and his friend. His friend, and me both used my 3DS's, (The original, and the XL. I had the XL,) with my game card in my 3DS XL system. My nephew had his DSi, and all of us was able to play with no problems. We enjoyed the game, and had a blast, just laughing, and giggling. His friend has since moved away. So now it's just me, and my nephew who enjoys the game together. We both play on my two 3DS systems. I have never had any freezes, or black screens since I've owned the game, on my DS, and 3DS. Maybe because my copy was brand new from Kmart. But anyway, I highly recommend this game. If you don't have a copy. You're missing out.",1524700800,5

7352,67,2961,"This is a masterpiece game, and must-have title to own for the PlayStation in my opinion. Sadly, this isn't like previously 'God of War' games, and Santa Monica Studio really took a gamble changing things up this time around. Fortunately their direction, and hard work really paid off. This game mildly reminds me of Horizon: Zero Dawn meets Tomb Raider, meets Assassin's Creed in many ways. This isn't a bad thing in my opinion, as I love all of those other games... so it was nice to see more of a game design that I really love to play. Despite the huge departure from the previous formula of what made God of War so popular, I really like the new change. Gameplay, Combat, Graphics, Sound, Music, and Story are all excellent. This is most certainly a contender for 'Game of the Year'. This game belongs in your library if you enjoy adventure style gaming, with strategic combat mixed in.",1524787200,5

7361,1284,1564,"This product arrived in a very filthy brown box, but the product itself is made of great quality.

Unfortunately that model case is too big even with a cover on the vita, it fits loose inside this case. I was expecting a secure fit. P100L might fit better with bulkier case covers.",1524787200,3

7391,1533,2146,"I bought this Wii U used from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  There were cosmetic scratches on the console, but the gamepad was flawless.  The console works great and I saved a lot of money buying used.  The Wii U is not being made anymore, so they go up in value for collectors.  The console itself doesn't have the best graphics or the most comfortable/intuitive controller, but the games are some of the best in the industry.  Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Xenoblade Chronicles X, downloadable virtual console games from NES, Super Nintendo, N64, GameCube, DS, and the ability to play any Wii game?  It's a great collection of titles for one console.  The gamepad even has a headphone jack so you can play quietly while your significant-other sleeps.

It's hard to go back to 720p graphics running at 20 frames per second (Breath of the Wild) after playing my PS4 Pro at 4K and 30+ frames per second, but the games are so much fun to play, you put up with the single drawback of the system.

Overall, I highly recommend the Wii U to anyone who missed the games, especially if you want to play the old virtual console games.  Save states functionality is included, so it's the best way to play these classics!",1524960000,4

Holds 16 games, my charger and my 3DS XL perfectly. The added stylus works way better than the stylus that came with the console. Many color choices is a plus too. I also discovered that the handle has a nice snug fit around the back of my hand when I grip the case directly, so I can carry it confidently without dropping it. I put a laminate card in the zipped pocket with my info on it (like a small luggage tag), but maybe for the next version/upgrade, the design team could add a clear sleeve on the back of one of the game holders to carry an ownership tag of sorts?

7430,725,53,"(It's worth mentioning that the online server for this game has been terminated as of the end of February 2018, so several original features of the game--like invasions, assists, the Old Monk gimmick, etc.--are now disabled. The game is still great though, so don't worry.)
This is the start of the most important series of video games to emerge in the past twenty years. Seriously. I cannot overstate this. Remember the days when the player was forced to adapt to the game? Remember when games didn't hold your hand for seven hours and treat you like a lost child? Remember when you couldn't adjust the difficulty in order to abate your frustrations? Remember when you weren't forced to wade through a story you don't care about? I've said enough. Here's the synopsis.
When King Allant of Boletaria awakens the Old One, the (second) most powerful demon in existence, the world outside the Nexus again becomes a killing field for demons and their transmogrified slaves. The player, a stranger to Boletaria and the fog-consumed lands surrounding it, is tasked with gathering the demon souls found throughout five different zones...But to what end? For power? For the restoration of peace? For no reason at all? It's up to you, player! It all depends on what aspects of the lore affect you the most--if, of course, you so choose to delve into the story buried beneath the gameplay.
I could go into so much more detail concerning the variations of play style, the arsenal of weapons and spells available, the sheer satisfaction of figuring out and beating a demon, the exquisite level designs and the pay-off for revisiting earlier areas...but there's too much to say. Believe the hype, expect a sharp learning curve, then get this game and get all the other Souls games--so the world might be mended. Umbasa.",1525046400,5

All dlc isn't actually on the disc. Yep! That's right! You just download all that wonderful dlc.. If you hadn't already for the standard edition. With that said, for those of you whom don't have internet just save yourself from a $50 price tag & buy this edition.

7507,1545,3027,"Okay Let's do this in a well formatted way:

Packaging:
 - What you get is a box with the two controllers and receivers squished together separated by a sleeve of cardboard
  inside of another box with some bubble kind of around it. Not my favorite and it allows the box inside to move.
  That's already a problem, but not the reason it got two stars. But this next part is.

Controls:
  - Okay so, the ""analog"" stick only really go to 8 directions like a d-pad. If you wiggle them around a little bit, they'll shake a little and almost
  go off course and since I play precise games like gitaroo man and castlevania curse of darkness (or even ratchet and clank really) I end up dying
  because I don't go where I want to.
  I actually want to go. That's not full analog control, it's a glorified D-pad
  - Now, let's say you don't care about the control stick and only like fighter games or just don't mind the D-pad thing. Well...then this thing is pretty
  cool
  - So, the wireless is pretty (and strangely) amazing. It's quick, connects right away and does it's job with no delay. No really, I couldn't find a delay
  at all.
  - The buttons are snappy and not too loud. They feel pretty good to hit as long as you like putting a little more pressure down for button hitting.
Asthetics:
  - Okay, this is just a point from me, but the lights on the controller are pretty bright. You'll ignore them quick, but holy crap does it blind at first
  glance.
  - As for feel? Feels just like a ps2 controller and colors are cool too.

Final Conclustion:
- Honestly, if it hadn't been for the control stick, I would've kept them, but I need something that works and this didn't. If you don't mind the glorified d-pad control stick, annoying packaging, and blinding light at first, by all means have at it.",1525392000,2

My only complaint would be to ask for a longer cord to connect to the Xbox. Solid purchase!",1525478400,4

I am a I recently purchased the Astro Gaming MixAmp Pro TR for Xbox One, the white version, for a more immersive experience on my Xbox console. With this I also bought the Sennheiser GAME ZERO Gaming Headset, also the white version [link below]. This combination, to say the least, has been not only pleasurable but a whole different experience to gaming. I am not a professional gamer but wanted to feel like I was truly immersed in the game. Without the MixAmp Pro, I was unable to utilize the full functionality of my Sennheiser headphones. If you are looking to really amplify, haha see what I did there, your experience with your high end headphones then I definitely recommend purchasing an amp, regardless if it is this specific amp or another.

Also worth noting: If you are using component cables with your PS2, this disc switches between several resolutions depending on the game, so your TV will need to be able to support all of these lower resolutions between 240p and 480p, otherwise, you may hear the game running, but not see anything.

7575,110,2886,"First some housekeeping. Xbox Live Subscription required as it's an online only game. 11GB mandatory patch as of this review.

You have to have a lot of imagination and creativity for lasting appeal of this game or at least hold your attention

Love the art style, best water graphics since opening of Bioshock (1). Audio is also really good especially the environmental audio. Aside from this, the game is pretty bare bones as I'll go into the game mechanics.

There are 3 quest types:
Hunt for Treasure Chests
Fight skeletons*
Capture chickens and pigs

There's no progression in the game and no story (unless you make one up yourself). You do  quests to gain money and use the money to buy cosmetic items (no stat boosts). Bad thing is, everything is ridiculously expensive. It takes hours of grinding for one cosmetic item. In order to unlock majority of the items, you'll have to grind quests which gets boring after a while especially when the challenge is the same. Also once you complete a task, you have to sail back to the quest giver which can take up to 15mins

Skeletons are the only major enemy in the game, and they all have the same battle animations/moves. The only difference is how they look and randomized attack and HP stats. There's also The Kraken is in the game, but it randomly pops up when it wants to, when it does, taking it down is anti-climatic as it just runs away. If you dive down to try to see its whole body...well the kracken is invisible. Just random grouped tentacles floating on the waves

There are raids in the game where you team up with other people to fight hordes of skeletons for treasure

Also, there are passive challenges like opening certain amount of chests. But the challenges can take hours to complete just one artificially extending the life of the game

PvP
This is where you attack other ships and pirates online. This is the most fun and frustrating part of Sea of Thieves.

good if you have a decent team or people you know to play with you. If you don't communicate and/or teamed up with noobs you'll have a bad time as you can be decimated by the other team as your team have to micro manage everything on the ship: have a scout, people on the cannons, person steering the ship, people patching up the ship/throw buckets of water back into the sea so it doesn't sink.

When everyone know what they're doing, and coordinate/work together it's a blast (this is rare unless you have friends to play with). Thus the this part of the game is as fun as the people you are playing it with.

If you don't have online friends, it's hard for you to get a decent team. First off, most won't communicate with you, or worst yet won't accept the mission to even start the quest.

There are no rewards for PvP, just you losing you quest progress if the enemy team starts shooting at you and/or sinks your ship...

After a few hours, you feel like you're done with the game. The game gets repetitive really quickly, unless you have friends who like getting together to raid other ships and like doing repetitive grinds cosmetics. It's like the developers saw how kids can put in 100s of hours on a game like Minecraft, where the game gives you a little and have to use or imagination to extend the playtime...but instead of building, you're raiding other pirate ships and grinding for your your next belt, beard or dress.

In the end, it feels like a tech demo for water physics and animation, and to test how much people are willing to grind for a different colored gun that has the same stats as any other gun in the game. If you get bored of the repetitiveness, you can create your own fun I guess*

7672,150,793,"Wonderful installment of Mario Kart.
This game has come a long was since SNES days.

Plenty of new and old tracks (revamped).
All the same lovable characters.

New kart customization, new game modes, etc.

The great part of this game is that it utilizes ""Download & Play"" feature that not many others out there do.
Essentially, this means you can buy one copy and have 2 people (on separate 3DS/2DSXL) play it off the one cart.
The one that has it loaded opens apps, selects ""Download & Play"" and the other opens that app and enters that lobby to download the game and join the host (local network play only).
The guest can only be Shyguy and use the generic kart, but you can play all modes together.

Recommend to anyone who likes Mario Kart series and maybe wants to play with their kids/friends, but don't really care what char/kart they choose.",1525996800,5

7677,464,2961,"The best looking game on PS4. Very polished and smooth gameplay. Good pacing and progression. When this game was announced I thought it was a reboot but it is actually a continuation of the series taking place many years after the events of god of war 3.

7692,150,432,"I am huge fan of the SO series ever since the PS1 release of SO2 (best one imo).
This one offered a new entry, but left a lot to desire.

This one just seemed very rushed in production.
While the story was there, it seemed underdeveloped and the characters lacked depth.

There was a ton of back and forth for quests and lack of variety, as there are a very limited number of zones.
All of the roles seemed unimportant through the game (gets more important for bonus dungeon).
The specialties were not all that helpful either, just seemed like another way to get people to grind out SP to raise them.
Crafting was almost worthless as you could always buy better gear than you could make due to lack of the needed materials

It all seemed like it was just leading to the bonus dungeon, which is rather lame if you ask me.
The game shouldn't be a platform to reach a stagnant bonus dungeon.

While I did enjoy the game (for the most part), it left a bad taste in my mouth at the end.
Rather anti-climatic, and no real sense of accomplishment once the end was reached.

If you can get this one on the cheap, I'd pick it up to play just for completion sake.
They could have done so much better with this one. but it was a good time killer for the price I got it at.",1525996800,3

7777,1243,1059,"GTA has been one of my favorite series since GTA III. I have had GTA V on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC. I'll start off with a bit of a negative feeling I had with it. I didn't like the idea of multiple player-characters but I believed if they could make the player-characters interact with each other, it could be very revolutionary for ... one player games. They really didn't succeed on that. I've spent countless hours on the game looking for a car that I wanted Trevor to have but won't see a single one. Then, I switch to Franklin and Michael and the first car I see is the one I wanted Trevor to have but outside of driving to Trevor, getting out and switching characters there wasn't much of a way to pull this off. To make matters worse, the other characters are rarely seen when you try to go back to where they were. This also applied to money, weapons, bullets, etc...

Besides that, this is a very fun version of GTA, my personal favorite. I thought the little stories for each character were funny, the NPCs were memorable and funny too. I still hear ""Green light, green light ...Martin Madrazo... give you green light!"" I also liked the way they had the characters of Franklin and Michael working together. Trevor is the star of the three but as with every GTA, they always go overboard with a character. Trevor should have had the most funny parts but most of his were serious and that's the other part, they made him too bitter. This is a longtime problem with GTA characters. None of the three characters were any happier at the end of the game as they were at the first of the game.

If you have played GTA games you already understand that part. A big part of the fun for me was just running around and beating up random people. See, a negative comes in, you draw the police attention way too often for the smallest things. My most hated one is still in this part. Police car turns into you while you're on a timed mission and on comes the sirens. I don't know if it was intentional but the mountain between San Andreas and Blaine County made for a perfect escape route no matter how many stars but it also meant I spent a lot of the game driving a 4WD to rush around the dirt roads.

The weapons still leave a lot to be desired. Hopefully, part 6 will rethink the way weapons are unlocked. It can be frustrating to finally get the two weapons you want with only 2 missions to do.

My last complaint is on the violence. In 2018, GTA V, is very tame. If nothing else, if they just made the violence similar to Fallout. The only reason I see this game being rated M is the language. I was also disappointed that they didn't release any story DLC.

But the graphics are very good, the pace of the game is faster than the previous part and really it's better paced than any of the GTAs since III. They also removed some of the once innovative parts that aren't just working like the dating that was required. The controls aren't as clunky as they used to be. You and I both can see the vast improvements they've made but it could be better. It's still a game every gamer over 18 should play.

I should mention the other part. GTA Online. I've never played it. I even found it a little annoying when a splash screen would pop up telling me about a new weapon in GTA Online. Most of those are available in story mode but a lot of the Online special content disappears, especially the vehicles. Then we're back to watching Youtube videos hoping to find out where to get our favorite car at. Those who have labored with GTA already know this too and I think it's why we keep doing it. Maybe if they made everything work better or more fair, it wouldn't feel like GTA?

You can easily spend 100+ hours on this game just like previous GTAs. It's well-worth the price.",1526342400,5

The buttons are small are easy enough to miss click though you'll get used to them.  The buttons lack an ergonomic curvature or placement making the mouse harder to pick up for repositioning.

7816,319,2959,"Want a simple, yet feature packed mechanical keyboard? Look no further. Now the first question you may ask, what is the different between this and the K70? At first glance, they look similar, however are there a few differences.

The K70 resembles the Razer Blackwidow X, an ""open-board"" design, with no back-plate, so the LED's just glow off the back of the frame, which may reduce the brightness but may make the colors appear more vibrant.

The Strafe however, resembles the Blackwidow Ultimate, with a ""closed board"" design, so you have the frame, a red backplate (white if you have the RGB version) and then the switch. So the Strafe has a red backplate to make the colors ""pop"" not as vibrant as the K70, but a whole lot brighter. If you have the RGB version you have a white backplate, so make all the colors pop.

Other than that, the only other major difference is the lack of media keys and volume keys, but luckily we do have a function key we can use to access these settings, just press FN and either F5 or F7-F12. Though if you want dedicated media keys, you can get the K68, which is very similar to the Strafe but has media keys and is dust and spill resistant.

Back to the review, this keyboard has a very simplistic design, which isn't bad at all. There's lots of gaming/mechanical keyboards that look like they came out of a sci-fi movie, which just goes to show companies will do anything to make a buck. This however, just looks like a premium keyboard, no weird corners or shapes, just a keyboard. Design gets an A+.

The Strafe uses Cherry MX switches, and knowing Corsair we couldn't expect less from their mechanical keyboard line up. The Red Led version of the strafe offers: Blue, Brown, Red and Silent switches. Mine has Cherry MX Blues, and for the most part the switches are implemented very well. However, I really do not like the stabilizers, as they are Cherry stabilizers. While they may be easier to work with when taking off the key caps, they don't feel as good as a Costar stabilizer, they just make the larger keys not feel mechanical, its like they bottom out right away. In fact, this is one of the reason why I'm rating this 4 stars. Switches get a B.

This keyboard is actually packed with quite a bit of features. You have:

N-Key rollover, so if you press every single key at the same time they will all register.
Full anti-ghosting, so no extra keystrokes or missed keystrokes.
FPS/MOBA keycap set, so if you want to make your WASD keys or a few other keys more easy to find, you can do that.
Key cap puller, seriously, why don't some of the higher end keyboards include this? *Cough* Razer *Cough*
USB 2.0 pass through, plug in the second USB connector into your PC and you can then use the port on the back, very convenient.
Wrist rest cutouts (Newer version of the Red Led Model)
Red Led Backlighting
Windows Lock key

Wow that's a lot of features. But, its amazing. Has features for enthusiast users and hardcore gamer's. However, here's another reason why I'm giving this 4 stars. In 2015, the Strafe RGB was introduced, and was the first Strafe to come with an included wrist rest. And at some point after that the Red led version was updated and now includes cutouts for the wrist rest. And the wrist rest from my old Strafe RGB works beautifully with it. But Corsair, why include the cutouts but not the wrist rest? You can go on Corsair's website and buy a K66/K68 wrist rest (They use the same wrist rest from the Strafe RGB) and pay an extra $10. But why do we have to do that? Features gets a B.

Build quality? What you expect from Corsair. Top notch. This keyboard isn't made of the aircraft grade aluminum like the K70. This is made of a matte-like plastic, and it feels solid. Keyboard doesn't move around when typing and its not a finger print magnet either. Key kap quality? They aren't double shot key caps, but they are decent. Build quality gets an A.

How about the lighting? Being the Red led version, you can actually create your own lighting effects via the Corsair CUE software, though your still limited to 255 shades of red, aka brightness levels. Its probably best just to keep this on the static red color. Lighting gets an A.

Finally, the software. This keyboard is compatible with the Corsair CUE software. With this software you can do anything from change what the Windows lock button does, to changing the lighting, to re-programming the entire keyboard. The limit is pretty much endless.

So, would I recommend this? YES! Amazing features, switches and build quality. Can't go wrong with this keyboard, especially considering its only $80, and its still a great keyboard, despite those 2 small gripes I have with it.",1526428800,4

Unfortunately the price has jumped a bit due to the canceled production. If you ever can afford to get this mouse, I cannot state how much I would recommend it.

This game has a real sense of adventure, with wildly unpredictable changes of scenery around every corner. It may seem random but that is what makes it a work of art. Playing God of War is like being immersed in the universe of The Odyssey and I'm loving every minute. This title is flawless...but if someone put a gun to my head and I had to find a downside I would say the limited movement is probably the least appealing part of God of War.

Example: All of a sudden after never landing on your properties they will land on them if they don't have to pay because you are in jail (with the auction only setting and no rents in jail).
Not AI issues but some programming stupidity examples:  Dice constantly (almost every roll) hit things on the table thus changing the outcome of the roll.  The dice should be rolled in sight (many times they are out of sight) and away from board pieces or they should make board pieces invisible.  Alternate game rules can not be combined.  AI token pieces can not be chosen.  Game can not be set with defaults so every time you play you have to reset every little thing.  There are more but you get the point.

7898,248,2961,"I'm only maybe halfway through the game, if that, but I haven't had any issues so far. The game is very well designed, and a joy to play; the story is compelling, and original, immersive, and unintrusive. This game innovates, but still feels like God of War; And Atreyu hasn't once proven a hindrance so far (you can tell the dev team put a lot of thought into designing this game).

I'd like to note that while the axe is the only weapon that kratos can wield (I think; which is new, as Kratos would usually obtain multiple weapons in previous titles), said axe and Kratos' and Atreyu's gear and skills are so heavily upgradeable and customizeable, and the axe's mechanics are so polished, that I don't expect that many people will be bothered.

As a fan of the GOW series, I did initially feel somewhat disappointed when I started the game and immediately realized that some version of the blades of chaos wouldn't play a role in this game; but there's a really nice nod to their importance in the series (and their significance to Kratos) in one of the first scenes (it may actually be the first scene, watch the bandages on Kratos' arms, you really can't miss it unless you're not paying attention); and once you get into the game, you won't miss them for long; as the axe is really fun to use once you're accustomed to it.

You can't jump in this game, which feels slightly off at first; but it's easy to understand why once you've got a grasp on the differences between this game and older titles. Another thing that you won't miss for long.

I knocked off one star because the game is a linear/open world hybrid in design; which in itself is fine, but it' can be somewhat difficult to find your way around, and there are several locations and items in the game which can't be accessed until progressing in the game; which means that the player will need to backtrack a lot; which is made somewhat inconvenient due to the only partially open world design. This seems to be addressed later in the game though, as the fast travel system gets upgraded over the course of the game (you can return to specific locations via magic doorways scattered throughout ""the realms"").

Also, boats could be a bit faster in open water and could steer a bit more smoothly.

Honestly, the few issues I've brought up here are nitpicks; God of War has never really been an open world series. It's only difficult to navigate because the world is full of twists and turns and detours by design; because GOW games have always been designed this way (mazelike, full of puzzles, that's a huge part of the appeal); and that's something that's difficult to translate into an open world. The Dev team has honestly done an amazing job balancing the history and expectations of the series with the new direction this entry takes.

9.7/10

update: so, fast travel does become available late in the game; and most of the items and areas in the game not directly related to the central plot seem to have been added for replayability; to extend the game beyond the story, instead of as a compliment to the story; so it's mostly just extra, post-game content.

Navigation also becomes easier when you realize that everything is accessible from the big lake in the center of the map.

There's one other thing I was wrong about but I don't want to spoil the plot so I'll keep it to myself.

7899,1588,444,"Wow, what a game. I've played Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3 all on PC. When I bought a PS4, I had to give this a go, and I'm glad I did. If you're familiar with the Souls games, you'll feel right at home with Bloodborne. The story is deeper and more developed in my opinion than in those games, and will really leave you with an urge to look up YouTube videos to learn even more about it. Combat is much more fast paced than in the Souls games, but I had no issue with it after having completed Dark Souls 3. I could understand though how people would have a difficult time with some of the bosses and enemies if they haven't played a Souls game before, or only played Dark Souls 1. Just keep at it, spend time to read item descriptions, and you're in for one of the best games on the PS4.",1526860800,5

7919,290,115,"This controller is for the Wii (plugs into the Wiimote where the Nunchuk normally goes) and gives you a GameCube controller look and feel. It's a real licensed Nintendo product but not actually designed by them, and that's the problem.

The ZL/ZR buttons are too recessed so your finger will hit the gamepad shell before the button is fully depressed. There's too much vertical travel compared to the GameCube pad.

Likewise the left analog stick is raised significantly higher than any of the other controls on the face of the pad. To move from the D-pad to the left analog stick you have to lift your thumb up a much higher distance than you did on the GameCube pad, where switching between the two was easy. Sounds minor but in practice it's irritating.

Overall this pad isn't terrible, and it works, but it's not as comfortable and ergonomic as the GameCube controller. It's easy to recommend as a cheap spare if your Classic Controller breaks someday, but it wouldn't be my main go-to controller unless I had no other options. Unlike a lot of no-name third party controllers I'd say it's better than most of them, but still a long shot from the GameCube design it is trying to represent.",1527033600,3

I had purchased a new unofficial Wiimote with Motion Plus built in, and it didn't work.  The game kept asking me to attach the Motion Plus accessory to my controller which was supposed to have it built in.  So, I purchased this official Nintendo Wiimote, and it worked perfectly!  I had the same problem with a Wii U Pro Controller and Smash Bros.  I'll be sticking with the slightly more expensive official Nintendo accessories from now on, and I recommend you do too.  5/5 stars.

The controller in the picture looks very well made. It's flat black and the material looks comparable to the best Sony controllers out there. Not at all representative of what you'll receive and they shouldn't be allowed to use that picture. What you'll get is glossy, cheap plastic that weighs so close to nothing at all that it might confuse you at first. I'd honestly like to see whats inside it because I'd bet it's hilarious. There's no mic plug for a headset. There's no vibration. It's wired. The triggers are very shallow and have to be pressed hard to work. This might be the worst controller I've ever seen. And that's okay BUT $50? It shouldn't be a penny more than $10 and after seeing the thing, you'd most likely want your $10 back. The regular Sony controller is MASSIVELY better than this.

8048,1284,2716,"Got this directly from Amazon and it arrived well packaged! I got it for both the n2dsxl black turquoise and Pikachu edition. The previous reviewer who says it doesn't fit the Pikachu version 100% is correct, but that is only because of Pikachu's raised nose. The duraflexi still hugs the system nicely and able to stretch over Pikachu's snout without budging. The only thing to note is that since there is a slight bulge, there will be a bit of an opening from the top of the front between Pikachu and the protector which has possibility to collect dust. I have no issues with this as I keep my DS in another Hori Pikachu zippered case so it doesn't collect as much debris inside this slight opening. Don't make the the same mistake I did though and blow inside this opening, you will get particles stuck inside and static will cling to them due to the tpu protector. I actually purchased other clear tpu cases that did not work well for the n2dsxl Pikachu edition due to this previous reviewer, but I'm glad I went with my gut and got another one of this Hori duraflexi protector. It will yellow overtime, but I feel the yellow color of the Pikachu edition will combat this and make it less noticeable. It's the BEST out of all the n2dsxl clear tpu protector cases on Amazon I have purchased to fit both the black turquoise and Pikachu edition. It also has a lip on the bottom of the protector that fits into the screws on the bottom of the device, this holds the protector well in place and won't budge during gameplay. It is a comfortable protector to hold and hasn't caused much slipping during long gameplays on either of my n2dsxl. A great buy from Amazon!",1527638400,5

8058,781,2274,"A very enjoyable game. I really like open world environments which this world does well (perhaps not quite as well as Bethesda but still pretty good.) The game has a heavy emphasis on movement. You're really meant to be running and jumping through the environment at all times and because you'll face hoards of the undead between point A and B, you'll be spending a good amount of time jumping across rooftops, vehicles, walls and other obstacles. The game styles itself as a ""parkour"" game however, you won't be doing many of the truly fancy moves that I think of when I think of parkour (jumping from wall to wall in an alley, hitting and rolling, etc). It's much more basic running and jumping.

Fighting can be a big part of the game or you can choose to mostly avoid it although there will be situations where it's unavoidable. Weapons continue to level up throughout the game but the zombie hoards also seem to grow.",1527638400,5

8066,725,444,"Now, much like the other Soulsborne titles, there is no right way to play this game. However (and this is aimed at you, grumpy one-star-raters), there is a way to play it so that it's much, much easier...The trick is to not give up within the first hour. But anyway. Very minor spoilers here for those who care about the hidden story.
Nothing is ever as it seems in Yharnam. You arrive in the city and undergo a strange blood transfusion...When you wake, it appears the whole city is infested by werewolves and blood-crazed hunters. But, as you eventually discover, this isn't even half the issue. As you dig deeper and deeper, you find out that the various factions within and without Yharnam are misguidedly constructing the eldritch horrors that now dwell throughout the land: mad ghosts, mutated humanoids, alien abominations...And all of it can be traced to an ancient being discovered beneath the earth. Effectively, this game covers nearly every single sub-genre of horror from gothic suspense to grimdark to Lovecraftian fantasy. Furthermore, the story features one of the most vicious commentaries on religious (and anti-religious) fanaticism I've ever seen in a video game.
If you're a fan of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, there is a chance you'll love this game; but, if you love those games for their pacing and style of play, there's also a chance you won't love this game. Here, the player is encouraged to be quick and often aggressive, instead of calculated and careful. There are also less options for garb and weaponry, but each weapon has an alternative mode that often changes its attacks drastically--for example, the threaded cane is a shortsword that switches into a whip. This latter feature might be the best part of the game.
In short, read the item descriptions for hints, test out every weapon you pick up, always retrace your steps, and don't ever lose confidence. And fear the old blood.",1527638400,5

Graphics are great, control is precise, replay value is good (different difficulty levels, the ""perks"" are awesome, side missions and challenges to complete, etc).  If you have a PS4 and you like bloody shooter games, you have to get this.  I especially enjoy cranking up the sound on my home theater system and rocking the dual-wield shotguns!  OH YEAH!

Maybe it's because they are taking GT in a completely new direction, maybe I need to get used to the new focus on the online competition/multiplayer feature.  I'm trying.  Over a year after release, the car and track list is still quite lacking.  At least they finally added a campaign mode, although late to the party.  And they are continuing with new content and game updates/download content every couple months which is giving hope.  Let's just say I play other PS4 games much more than this one.

How do I kill that guy?!  He has sniped me 12 times in a row and I can't get past this part of the game?  Oh forget it, I wasn't enjoying it very much anyway.""  That's how this game played out for me.  Only got about 5% into Mad Max before I quit it altogether.  The gamepad/control interface is bad and the driving mechanics are pretty sloppy too.  There are many better games out there.  Pass.",1527724800,3
8081,262,83,"This game is my 2nd favorite shooter on PS4.  (First is Wolfenstein The Old Blood, how great it is!)  The graphics in this latest DOOM installment are simply awesome.  Control is very precise and smooth.  But it's the gameplay where this one stands out.  ""Frantic action"" doesn't come close.  My heart was pounding after several different shootouts in this game.  Can be replayed over and over, with joy.  Plus it has arcade mode if you want to play for score.  Also there is the snapmap feature which opens up a whole new door to... hell.  All user-created content, unique and original maps.  This is an amazing addition and a similar feature should be put into all games.  I think PS Plus is required for snapmap but check it for yourself.
P.S. I'm glad the ""dark evil hell"" theme was toned down a little for this one.  Play some of the older DOOM games and you will see what I mean -- the very dark rooms, the jump-out-at-you demons, the strong focus on evil... it is very effective, and it is disturbing.  I am not a pansy, and this game has an acceptable level of evil hell guts creepy factor.",1527724800,5
8082,1533,3145,"I just purchased a model ""New Nintendo 3DS XL"" for myself and the first thing I did to protect my electronics was to buy a protective hard shell for the 3DS and a case to store the 3DS, games, and charger.  What attracted me to this Brendo case was that it is large enough to fit the 3DS with a case on it, unlike smaller, more snug carrying cases.  It can hold a whopping 24 game cartridges plus one in the 3DS for a total of 25 games you can have on hand.  There is plenty of room for the charger, stylus, and a screen cloth in the zipper pocket.  The hard shell protects everything very well, even if you drop it.  Don't overlook the free stylus either!  I am currently playing Zelda Spirit Tracks which requires you to hold a stylus the entire time.  The standard stylus is tiny and uncomfortable to play with for an extended period of time.  The stylus included in the Brendo package is much thicker, longer, and more comfortable to hold.  You need this stylus is you are playing any game that requires you to use a stylus!

I am very satisfied with my purchase and didn't find any flaws with the product.  5/5 stars.

8087,1533,1104,"The first thing I did when I bought a new Nintendo model New 3DS XL was to search for a hard shell for it.  My favorite color is black, so I wanted a black case.  Also, I didn't want to pay too much, and the TNP case was appropriately-priced at $12.  It was easy to get onto my New 3DS XL, and it is a snug fit.  It adds a slight amount of bulk to the package, but that just makes it easier to hold for larger hands.  Everything you need is easily accessible, such as the 3D slider, volume slider, and stylus.  In fact, I was new to the 3DS and had a difficult time finding the stylus without the case.  It is flush with the outside of the 3DS, so I had to flip it over and look to find where the stylus was located.  With this case, it is easy to feel for where the stylus is because there is a gap in the clamshell, so that is a pretty big plus for me.  The cameras are also uncovered, so you won't have any problems taking pictures.

The only flaw I found with this product is that it does not cover the back of the 3DS in any way.  If you drop your 3DS on any of the other sides, the case will do a good job of protecting it I believe, but if it hits the hinge side, it has no protection.  Due to the way the 3DS is made, I don't see any way to offer protection to this vulnerable hinge, so I'm not subtracting a star for the vulnerability.  Using this case is still better than not using any case at all, it's just not perfect protection like an Otterbox Defender phone case would be for example.  Still, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the black aesthetic like I do.  5/5 stars.

8106,1613,1382,"These are very comfortable, and they feel very durable and high quality. I wasn't very impressed with the amp though. It didn't work, plugging directly into the playstation via USB. It would light up, but none of the buttons would work. If you plug directly into the controller, it works better, but lose the amp and easy controls that come with it, which means you have to mess around in the playstation audio settings anytime you want to mute your mic or adjust the volume levels. You could just unplug your mic from the headset; that would be the easiest way to mute with plugging in directly into the ps4 controller. There was a delay with my mic audio when adjusting the settings on my ps4. I haven't experienced that with other headphones. The amp also didn't work with my xbox one. What does it work on?? Also, the mic monitoring on the ps4 wasn't very clear. Mic monitoring is a huge deal to me that many manufacturers don't advertise, or get right. If you can't hear yourself talk, then how do you know if other people are hearing you right?? We've all played games with people where you can hear literally everything going on in the background at their homes; the dog barking, their mom yelling at them, music playing. That's usually because they have no idea what their mic is picking up. Or they talk waay too quietly in their mic, and you always have to tell them you can't hear them. OR, the person that is so LOUD they could be eating their microphone for all you know. Good mic monitoring on people's headphones would solve so many problems! Anyways, these are super comfortable, and the sound quality is warm and great due to the larger mm drivers. I was just bummed mainly that the amp didn't work on my xbox or ps4. You have no external controls if you plug directly into the controller. And if you move your xbox controller, there's all this analog feedback from the 3.5 mm jack that comes across in your friend's games. No thanks, I'll continue my search. So far, wired usb Turtle Beach headphones have been the absolute best I've had on xbox and ps4. The mic monitoring was amazing too.

8119,67,3151,"These grips feels really nice on my controller. I've used Squid Grips on my PS3 controllers, and the Kontrol Freeks (KF) feel better in quality--in regards to it's nice rubberized feel and texture. I had to apply the grips twice on my PS4 controller, because the instructions weren't very clear on where I should begin installation. Unlike other grips I've used, the KF grips don't seamlessly wrap around the controller handles; This doesn't seem to be a problem for me, but I liked that Squid Grips fit so well though. I can already feel the major difference the KF grips makes while gaming, and I like how it feels.

 Something to consider before using these, the grips will add some slight thickness around the handles. Because of this I'm no longer able to use my Collective Minds Strike Pack, or place my controller on my Controller Gear stand. I'm glad that I can still charge it in my PS4 charger at least. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I'm not certain that I'm going to wrap my other PS4 controllers if I can't use some of my accessories.

In that amount of time I was waiting, I could've drove to my nearest store and bought a physical copy and got home faster then it was to get my code. But I didn't because I thought amazon's digital one would be faster/instant. Not to mention it is super pricey. 60 dollars for a year is a lot. Maybe I shouldn't of bought it because I don't take advantage of everything Plus offers to make it worth it.

8154,67,2575,"I love playing Diablo III. It's a fun hack-and-slash game with lots of action, and loot. Reaper of Souls changed the game so much for the better with Patch v2.0. The Auction House was finally removed, and loot drops were significantly increased--making the game fun to play again. Grabbing the Collector's Edition was a no-brainer for me, since I'm still very active and passionate about playing this game. The Collector's Edition comes with some awesome Diablo goodies such as an oversized mouse pad, art book, soundtrack, and behind-the-scenes DVD! There are some nice digital goodies that come with this package that apply to not only the game of Diablo, but World of Warcraft, and Starcraft II as well--to reward your purchase.

While a digital copy of this game can be acquired in other ways (and for much less money), the Collector's Edition provides the physical rewards that are essential to the true collector. This is a must-have for any fan, and it's a purchase I definitely recommend getting while supplies still exist.",1528243200,5

8161,1243,2675,"This is one of those games that makes you wonder if we really do need 3D games. I know we do but this one covers up the downfalls of 2.5D with gameplay, depth and one of the best stories you will find in a RPG these days. I am a huge Fallout fan, have played and beaten every version up until 4. I love the wasteland setting, the doomsday apocalypse feeling of these games and Wasteland 2 does a very good job of impressing you with everything except the graphics, though they're not bad for a 2.5D game. I would recommend it for anyone who loves Fallout but isn't 100% caught-up in graphics. Anyone who likes deep RPGs with a story, it took me 103 hours to fully complete this game and I will probably playthrough it again.",1528329600,5

8166,173,1252,"finicky, but bluetooth from my perspective, (except for phones and non windows peripherals) is a broken technology that is difficult to deal with at best. I'm a tech with 15+ years of experience. I can ""get it to work"" but it can be challenging in windows 10. I thought spending more money would make a difference (as this has it's own driver on board) but it hasn't. Still have re-connect issues after successfully pairing it initially on 3 computers as a test of it's reliability and it can be frustrating to deal with. Not so much disappointed in this product, (well, i am a little actually, but mostly unhappy with the bluetooth standard for pc's (windows that is; don't know about macs) and how windows  10 bluetooth just stinks. I've had to uninstall all resident bluetooth, reboot, reinstall adapter, enable ""Aventree"" as the default sound for my speakers, etc and...AAaahhrrggg!!!

Updated by one star for excellent, and I mean, above and beyond extraordinary customer service. Unlike any I have ever experienced. Here's my updated review:  Update. I spent just a teeny bit more time with Aventree's product, and have greatly improved performance. I just love the on-board driver. makes it much easier. I still have difficulty connecting, but now as I spent more time with the aventree product, it is strictly the blue-tooth platform that only occasionally gives me a problem. My ""blue-tooth"" life without Aventree would be a nightmare. (I have cheap or inexpensive blue-tooth dongles littering my desk, a literal ""graveyard"" of blue-tooth failures) Keep up the good work Aventree. I will make more if not all blue-tooth purchases from you alone. Upgraded to 4 stars.",1528329600,4
8167,1243,1999,"Some of my fondest gaming memories are of Final Fantasy. Here's a few highlights I still remember:
Summer of 1989, a friend bought me a Gameboy for my birthday, I returned it to Hills department store and used the store credit to buy an unheard of game called Final Fantasy on the NES. I played the game that whole summer and even took my NES on vacation with my parents (I was 13 or so).
1996-2000, my mom and I raised my younger cousin (she was 4-7 years old). She would lay on my bed and watch me play Final Fantasy 7, 8 and 9. The emotions of those games seemed kind of silly to me but she would be so wrapped up in the stories and character relationships. I even remember picking her up at school one day and her saying, ""Are you going to go look for Rinoa tonight?""
But, starting with Final Fantasy X, I kind of lost interest in the series. I did play all of them but none really made me feel like the old ones did. I didn't like how the characters in this one (XV) look or act but I won't try to sound ""too cool"" and say this is a bad game. It's quite good and fairly unique for a Final Fantasy game. The combat did take some getting used to but within an hour it was like second nature. I was surprised that the game didn't last longer. I finished it in 76 hours. That's certainly not a short game but I think maybe the older ones seemed longer because I would only play for a few hours at a time. I'll keep an eye on future releases and hope they continue the progression they've started with this one.",1528329600,4
8168,691,235,"Review is for this edition only, which I have not played.

8171,135,3163,"I have been trying various wireless headsets for my PS4 Pro and stumbled across the LS30. For reference,  I already own the Steelseries Arctis 7 and Hyperx Cloud Flight. While both of those headsets are very impressive,  i still wasn't fully satisfied with either. Both headsets lacked overall volume and the Cloud Flight is mostly plastic. Enter the LS30 from Lucidsound. This headset is metal and very durable. Granted its about 2oz heaviet than my other headsets but nothing that noticeable. I can play for hours with no problems. Sound wise i think the Cloud Flights sound a little better but not by much. The LS30 has 3 eq settings and sounds very good for both games and music. They definitely are the loudest of the 3 by a good margin. I keep the LS30 at about 50% volume and the others at about 80-90%. Comfort wise i actually like all 3 pretty equally. For microphone quality, the Arctis 7 has the best microphone but the other 2 are still very good and perfect for chatting in game. The LS30 has roughly the same battery life as the Arctis 7 from what i have noticed. The Cloud Flight without led lights on wins with avout 30hrs of battery. Price wise i was able to get the LS30 for about $40 less than the others. I honestly could have just bought the LS30 first and been completely satisfied with them. As it stands right now the LS30 is my daily driver headset that i use the most and the other 2 are sitting in my closet. I cannot recommend the LS30 enough.",1528416000,5

Pros: Great to look at, fun to play, forgiving of mistakes (usually), very customizable, very cool story.

Cons: Sometimes the camera levels out when you don't want it to. The camera settings needed changing for me to play the way I wanted (See pros).

Other: The story is presented in several ways I wasn't expecting, which was wonderful. I don't want to say too much about this. I explored choices in this game and was not disappointed by the developer's foresight.",1528416000,5
8182,509,2886,I cant even start this game. Every time I try to do my first quest my ship is sunk by some other player for no reason other than they think its funny I guess and then I have to start all over again. And if its not other players sinking me its my ship sinking from bumping a rock or being rained on. Its like Rare was trying to make a sailing simulator. If you manage to get a crew and can survive all the game is is gather treasure and bring it back. Its designed for try hard players that play anything with a ranking system. So if you like games where you do nothing but kill other players and rank up go for it.,1528416000,1

I can't imagine how bad my system would look today if I didn't have this protective case on it.  There are scratches and scrapes on the protective case now that would really bum me out if they were on the system itself.  It snaps on easily and stays snug with the system, doesn't add much in the way of bulk, and gives you easy access to all the ports.  In fact, makes it really easy to find the power button just by feeling alone.

8224,319,1382,"This is a GREAT headset. The sound is good, the mic is decent, and the build quality is amazing. Not to mention, its feature packed.

At a glance, these look like your typical gaming headset. However, the whole thing is made of metal and aluminum, with leather stitching. Its very comfortable, and can take a beating, that's for sure. And since its made of metal/aluminum, you can wipe off any dirt with ease.

The sound is amazing. 53mm drivers, with stereo audio. However, you can toggle between stereo mode and 7.1 surround sound via the USB Sound card, and the 7.1 surround sound is emulated, so it doesn't sound that great, but it works. The bass is very good, and the lows and highs are crisp.

The mic quality? Its okay. It definitely screams ""Gaming headset"" but its clear and sounds decent, while being on the quiet side, so you may have to tinker with it when you first get the headset. Overall, sound and build quality get an A+.

Now, I mentioned this headset has quite a bit of features, and boy does it. In the box you get:

The headphones
USB Sound card
Detachable mic
A set of velour ear cushions
Airplane Adapter
Mesh carrying bag

And the headset does feature 7.1 virtual surround sound, it doesn't sound that great because it is emulated, but it does work, and works very well. This headset also does NOT have sidetone/mic monitoring, which is a let down for some people, but for me that's perfect, I find sidetone more annoying then useful.

Now, here's the big flaw. You get a set of velour ear cushions in the box, to replace the leather ear cushions if you wish. However, swapping these ear cushions is a PAIN IN THE BUTT. I spent nearly an hour just trying to get one ear cushion swapped. Its very frustrating, and you pay $100 for this headset, why is it this difficult? I've swapped ear cushions on $30 headsets with ease, this is the biggest and only flaw with this headset.

I highly recommend this headset, what I DON'T recommend is swapping the ear cushions... good lord.",1528675200,4

8323,67,1259,"I purchased this product because I was looking for a way to stop my hands from feeling hot and sweaty. I've used several other methods to try and keep my hands dry & cool while video-gaming. I've tried wiping my hands on my pants, a towel, using a small fan, and I've even tried official gaming gloves (see my review on those). I've even gone so far as to try biking gloves, to see if they would help. I'm happy to say that GamerGrip works as intended for me.

I could feel the product work immediately as I began to use it. Just as the directions recommend, and pea sized amount is all that needed. Upon applying the lotion, I immediately began to feel it working. It has a nice smell of spearmint too. After drying, the product immediately made my hands feel dry--with a slight tacky grip. Unfortunately, after having the product on my hands for 90-minutes, my palms began to itch and slightly break out. I do not have profusely sweaty hands, so this product worked for me (at least)--and it stopped my hands from feeling hot and moist. However, the slight irritation to my skin is concerning.

Unfortunately I can't recommend this product, based on my own experience and use of it. It appears to do as it states, but at a cost of skin irritation & itching on my hands. Also, the price of this product is too much for only 1-ounce. I'd say use this product at your own risk.",1529193600,3
8324,1197,3189,Great game! I love the storyline and the history facts presented in the plot!,1529193600,5
8325,866,3190,"Here is where the game sucks:
1.  You get this whole deal about being able to use old saves from DAO and DA2.  The reality is, it has next to no actual affect on game play or story.  The hype on that was a huge disappointment, that alone would make it 4 stars if it was perfect, but it isn't.
2.  It feels like you get pigeon holed to quickly in the game for what role your characters are playing compared to DAO, but let's face it, DAO was a trailblazer. This was just another forgettable game that you pray you can get at least a dollar out of by trading it in at Gamestop.
3.  All of the mages feel like they play the same, except the knight enchanter, which frankly after you play knight enchanter there is no reason to ever play anything else.  The knight enchanter is so horribly OP that you really don't even need a group, you can just transfer your damage into a barrier which is basically a form of temporary hp.  Never say die basically.
4.  The warriors basically suck - the only use I have for them are meat shields, but again, knight enchanter does a better job at this + more damage.
5.  Rogues could be fun but the combat system is so that it is over simplified and the abilities you could be using to make a huge difference just end up being flash no substance.
6.  The next part some don't agree with me, but this is a chicks game.  There is only one purely straight female love interest in the game and she acts more like a guy, she is ugly, and looks more like a guy.  There is a bisexual female character you can make your love interest but she is  bland and uninteresting, and she is your NPC diplomat, meaning she has no active adventuring role with you.  Kinda lame.
7.  Yeah, we get it, EA is trying to look friendly to certain segments of the gaming population.  But they really go overboard with this.  It feels like the entire cast posts on tumblr or was dreamed up of how regular people are by people on tumblr
-We have a trans character randomly shoehorned in, acting as a second in command for a mercenary company, thinks she is a guy or something
-the guy who runs it is bisexual,
-the one elf lady you can get into your group is a lesbian, not even attractive
-oh yeah, the one character who could have had more done with him seeing he is from the Imperium and they make him a gay man
(Yeah I get it, Leliana from DOA is bi and the weird assassin guy is too, but they were actually interesting characters)
8.  Given 6 and 7, and other inconsistencies with the story, I would say even if the combat system and class system was perfect, it would drop the game to at least a 3 star, that's just how bad the story is.
9.  The game is just to damn long.  It doesn't feel like it gets anywhere for hours and hours and then you finally beat it.  When I played it, some of the quests were screwed up.
10.  The dialogue, it is terrible.  I am not the best writer in the world, and maybe I have been spoiled on good writing, whoever wrote the story and dialogue for this game seems like they unintentionally tried to make everyone suffer from Asperger Syndrome.  I mean I actually loved Sand who would scream about ""ENCHANTMENT!"", I thought it was awesome, what isn't awesome is when your writing is so bad everyone seems like a slight step up from that.
11.  The story does not convey a serious difference between the protagonists and the antagonist other than ""bad guy keel everyone if we lose ok?""  There is little to no motivation for the main bad guy other than he wants to be a god, but a god of what?  Corpses and dark spawn?  Lol, ok.....  As a player I had no motivation to even care about the protagonists.  There was maybe two I considered redeemable or even decent, the rest of them were tedious rewrites of each other.
12.  The graphics are hot garbage, not much of an improvement from 2 or even origins, and at least those two had better gameplay.  The only thing that sort of redeemed it was being able to change almost anything about the characters appearance.

The things that are good about this game, I only put this in here so if you read the junk above and think ""I don't mind mediocre games with bad stories"", maybe this will convince you to buy it.
1.  You get to be an elf, human, dwarf, quannari.  Pretty cool, nice change from 2.  Being a Quannari is awesome just because you don't get to in the others.  There isn't much mechanical difference between them all, the dwarf still can't do magic of course, which is fine.
2.  Your race choice actually makes some difference in the story
3.  The history you choose does impact the game as well
4.  I found the crafting system to be decent, it was not quite perfect but a very good attempt was made.  More options would have been better
5.  The expansions were actually pretty fun.  Honestly I enjoyed them more than the main story.  It would have been better to base the entire story around them, maybe cut out most of the characters and replace them with ones from Origins and 2.  If they did that I would have gave this at least a four star, three if I was drunk.  lol
6.  My wife thought it was ok when she got past the cringey LGBT crap, she just brought varric and black wall and vivi along, I don't blame her either, the rest were hot garbage.",1529193600,1

8338,691,2961,"GOW is a game that borrows much from previously released and better games; Tomb Raider, Last of Us and of course Bloodborne.
It does this to revolutionize the franchise which was pretty much a winning streak (minus Ascension) all the way through.
Now, out of all the games to copy from, it sure looks like they tried to move away from an already perfect fighting system.
You should've tried to make this an Original GOW game and not re-doing it from top to bottom.
Openworld not necessary for a good GOW game, but I like that they tried.
Looks wise, well, we all know the game is slick so let's not waste time there.
Upgrading sucks, exploring sucks because unless you have finished the game you will not have what you need to explore everything.
Basically, play the game first like we want or enjoy backtracking a lot.
So did you get that? The devs want you to finish the game and then explore and that is honestly the best option but it sucks you have to do this on their schedule.
Levelling for enemies, I have always hated this as its just a stall tactic and apparently nobody picked up on this.
Makes no sense, just forces you to grind more and then once you and the enemy are on the same level, it is pretty much like all the other fights.
Of course you can modify this by going in overlevelled to make it a cake walk or underlevelled if you want a real challenge but ultimately the mechanic is a way to keep you from going into areas that they don't want you accessing yet, and oh boy do they like to do that in this game.
Travel time and how to get there.
Not fond of this either.
When I first went to use the portal doors, I stupidly thought that I would pick my spot on the map, hit a button, go through the door and re-appear on the other side, magically transported to where I wanted to go, but oh no, we need to add in some conversations and actually make you walk down on otherworldly pathway to the magic door, which by default takes only 30 seconds to a minute, but what a stick in the wheel. Ditto the rowboat. And don't get me started when it comes to going to other to worlds cause it really makes me not want to travel to other worlds.
And it becomes really tedious when the conversations are exhausted and it's only silence for the whole stretch.
Solution: don't put this crap in a GOW game.
Levelling is ridiculous, clearly made to make you play at their pace and then go exploring but so far what I have put on is working and no real reason to go up and look for more until the end.
Nothing was supremely innovated with the copy pasting features of other games.
The one area where I couldn't complain if I wanted to is the combat styles:
The axe is awesome, love the Thor return to hand effect it has and being able to throw it around was nice and then you get a pretty comprehensive bare-handed combat and eventually the sweet, sweet blades of chaos.
All fleshed out with unique moves and upgrades,  and this is the end of any really stand out parts of the game as the rest is more akin to watching a movie then what a lot were expecting in GOW game.
As a matter of fact, the new more personal camera view is a drag when fighting in higher numbers then one, which happens a lot and has been mentioned in many reviews.
I do like the oral cues, like watch your left from the boy and the head but this is not an ideal view for what I want to achieve, it is unfortunately passable so people put up with it, but it may take some adjusting, which is super weird because like I hinted at before, combat did not need to be re-invented in any shape, way or form but it was going to get updated and thats  the real shame here, taking the perfect part of any game franchise and wiping your butt with it instead of using it correctly.
To re-iterate the combat was already perfect and should not have been messed with, as there was no reason.  5 bloody games all the same, all successful (minus ascension) using the same fixed view point.
Yeah that needs to be changed. STAT.
Its one of the most divisive games as far as gaming generations go, the true fans (you know the ones who have played all the GOW years ago multiple times) are now wrinkly old granpas and the new  fans aren't even really fans, you just like this one GOW game cause thats all you played and don't know better. (Im sure there are exceptions and some old schoolers like this new vision of GOW and vice versa)
And it becomes unashamedly directed to younger people, when the Mimir says  A little swole  in the middle of a battle, advising Kratos that his enemy is really OP (overpowered).
Swole?? What genius managed to get that to popular status for pumped up?
Just say he is ""jacked up"" and move on.
But on to a more interesting note, it would be just as jarring and reality breaking if the boy said gnarly dude which we all know that ones been around for a while so I guess it needed the new slang lexicon to you know, practically flat out tell you this game is designed for the younger hipper crowd.
But hey thanks for playing the first games and putting this badass on the map.
And another thing,  pretty doesnt a game make, and this is the biggest bragging rights the game has, the way it looks, and Id sacrifice half of that for that awesome and yes even familiar battle mechanics.
Seriously, I could go on and on...I mean there some joy to be found for sure, but this is not a GOW game.
If this were a true GOW game the emphasis would ve been on bigger badder boss battles, more creature type foes, brutal executions and  proper nipples instead of Nipelheim and not on exploring, levelling up or drawing out the experience just to say ""Like how pretty our game is? Isn't it pretty?""
Which is rarely a minus but I wanted not to have to sit back for 10 minutes of cutscenes and travel time, it became a real deal breaker with me near the end.
Fun game but I miss the GOW 1,2,and 3 when the camera angles were so perfect, you didn't need a joystick to adjust them constantly and could utilize jumps as attacks and to avoid damage, now it's block, dodge or run. (how is that better?)
Also, having read the overwhelming  5 on 5 reviews that are just piling up, one tends to wonder, are they comparing it to the original GOW games or on its own merits, because I can promise you the real fans of GOW are only comparing GOW PS4 to the originals and the twenty somethings who probably never even played a GOW game are in love with this, but THIS, did not put GOW on the map, it was very much there being enjoyed thoroughly by it's true fans and therefore the twenty somethings DON""T HAVE ALL THE FACTS.
Go play all the other GOW games, trust me, they're more fun and more open to replayability.
I will finish this and complete most quests afterwards (the valkyries must be freed) but it was so long and slow at times, that I know I'm not going to replay this unless I get amnesia.",1529280000,3

The game is great and they are constantly adding new things to it which I like. I couldn't give it 5 stars though because of Ubisoft's servers. WOW, they are bad. The game freezes A LOTTTTTT. People are constantly getting kicked out of games and having to restart the game.

Also, for anyone who has never played this, it is not like Call of Duty where you have unlimited lives. Once you are dead online, you have to wait until the next round. This is huge because if a player leaves the game or lags out like I said earlier, you basically lose. 5v4 games never turn out well for the underdogs. On top of that, sometime you will start a game with 5 players on one team and 3 players on the other team cause they lagged out and can't join back. If you lose that game, you still lose as many points as you would have if it was 5 vs 5 which is SOOOO unfair because that is due to Ubisoft's servers not working, not people quitting.

That is a major problem and they need to address it but unfortunately, I don't think they will ever address it since the game has been out for a very long time with no word about this.",1529452800,4

The map is huge and there are a lot of cars and customization options you can play around with.

The career mode was one of the best stories I've ever played. It's amazing how it all comes together at the end with the three different characters you can play.

The online mode is great and a ton of fun to play. There are an unlimited amount of awesome missions that you and your buddies can play around with to earn some cash and take out other real players. Hint, save up for the tank and then you will own the town!

The one and only downside to this game is the loading time, I get that it is a very, very big game but the loading screens online are so long sometimes it's not even fun to play. On top of that, finding a game with your friends is nearly impossible. It lags out constantly trying to connect you and many times, my friends and I just switch to another game. Cause there is nothing like waiting 30 mins to play, get in game and then lag out. That is a major frustration and I hope they can address this.

8416,461,1656,"This game is a director's cut of the movie, which was a director's cut of the 2002 game based on the same name. I was reluctant on watching the movie, but I might watch it now after playing this game.

The story is that a Lombax named Ratchet dreams of being a Galactic Ranger, among the ranks of Captain Qwark, whom he idolizes.  But when he tries to become one, he is rejected.  Meanwhile, a robot named Clank, who was meant to be a ruthless Warbot, was made by mistake as a small, but intelligent, harmless robot.  He quickly escapes the facility and finds him self on Veldin, where Ratchet lives.  Meanwhile, a dark, sinister plot is brewing, and Ratchet and Clank must prove they are worthy to be among the ranks of the Galactic Rangers and save the galaxy.

Gameplay is the same as all the other Ratchet and Clank games: A run and gun platformer, and a darn good one.  This takes elements of the other games and combines a lot of them into a great game.  There's only one thing I don't like about his game, but we'll get into that.  The goal is to explore each level, accomplish objectives, purchase and level up your weapons, defeat bosses.  Longtime Ratchet and Clank fans will feel right at home as they blast their way through level after awesome level.  There are plenty of side objectives that unlock extra goodies.  Players can find cards scattered throughout the game, some dropped by enemies and others hidden away.  Completing sets of cards unlocks bonuses so they're well worth gathering.  Controls are tight and responsive and it's a great time blasting away your enemies to save the galaxy.

The levels are massive with a lot to explore, and you will be rewarded for doing the optional quests.  Aside from the cards, there are also hidden Gold Bolts that unlock extra goodies.  And when you finish the game, you will have the option to replay the game in challenge mode.  It's a harder romp but you will have a bolt multiplier and all your previous weapons and gadgets.  It's a ton of fun and a good chance to gather up anything you missed.

The one major flaw I have with the game is the camera.  See, when you go into an aiming mode, it inverts the controls, and you can't turn this off! It makes no sense to me and has caused me more than a few deaths.  Other games have done this and I cannot understand the benefit of changing the camera controls while aiming and now allowing you to undo it. Sure, I can teach myself to move the sticks different directions when aiming, but when I turn off the game and come back to it, I Have to relearn it all.  It has driven me to turning off the game a few times.  But that's the one major flaw I have with the game.

Presentation is amazing.  The graphics are awesome, some of the cutscenes are ripped from the movie, but not all of them are.  The music is awesome and gets you pumped for the action, and the voice acting is spot on.  The actors from the movie returned to voice their characters and they do a great job playing off each other.  Ultimately a great tribute to a great game series.  Captain Qwark narrates the action, and his play by play commentary got a laugh from me on more than a few occasions.

So, if you have a PS4 or are planning on getting one, do yourself a favor and pick up the quintessential run and gun game.  You're gonna have a good time if you do.",1529625600,5
8417,1644,123,"I've always been into racing and having a little racing simulator at home just seemed like something that would be awesome!

And don't get me wrong, this thing is very fun and I still use it. I bought this specifically to play Forza on Xbox One. Bought it as soon at Forza Horizon 3 came out. It is fantastic for that game. It really is a good time, driving is easy and fun. Hint, use 480 degrees turning on the wheel setting for video games. 900 degrees is just too much.

The pedals feel like a real car, the gas is light and easy to push, the clutch is medium and the brake is hard. The shifter does not feel like a real car at all. I can shift into any gear by literally flicking my finger at the shift knob. I wish there was more weight to it. Also, in today's day, most cars have more than 6 gears. This shifter only has 6 so if you are playing with a car with more gears, you are out of luck.

The steering wheel is ehhh. It does not feel like a real car at all. The steering wheel is soooo tiny and not even close to a real car and the force feedback is weird, it just shakes the steering wheel. Doesn't have a ""real car"" feel even a little bit.

The thing that I really like about this wheel is how much fun it is to play on arcade racing games like Need for Speed or Forza Horizon. Once you get into the real racing sims like Forza 7, it is nearly impossible to drive. I use a controller on that game cause the steering wheel is so unrealistic and hard to use that it is just not fun.

If I were going to buy another racing sim, I would honestly save more money and get the Fanatec setup. It's such a better experience.",1529625600,3

8420,1368,1654,Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2 is on ONLINE ONLY multiplayer shooter. The game is a great alternative to the more violent titles like Battlefield and Call of Duty.

8422,477,17,"It really lacks some fun options and lacks a lot of match options the previous games had, that made for a lot of fun. For instance you can't turn off the over the top rope as an option in battle royals.  Match options are pretty much automatic depending on what type of match you're playing. When you go to match options after picking your character it only gives you the choice of momentum on or off, title match and the areana you want to play in.

In previous games like 2K14 you could turn off pins, submissions, over the top rope, etc. There was an option to turn on KO's. The submission system in this game is horrible and difficult. You can totally be winning a match the entire time and suddenly lose because the system is so bad.

As a long time player of Raw vs Smackdown, Here comes the pain, WWe12, and Wwe13 the change from using the D-pad to using the left stick for grapples is super annoying. Should have left the left stick as taunts. OH and unlike previous games there's no option to change the controller to different match options. There used to be a few options for different controller configurations depending on what you needed. (what if you're a southpaw?).

The graphics are good, Big improvement on the graphics over the ps2 and ps3 wwe games. Despite the nit picking i think its an improvement over wwe2k15.  One thing I find slightly annoying and is a huge nit pick is that when you go to select your wrestler and hit the button for superstars it automatically every single time goes straight to austin, and when you pick the next one unless you're picking someone from a team/stable for some reason goes straight to seth rollins.  Good thing you can just hit L1 or L2 to scroll thru wrestlers alphabetically.  I'm guessing in say 2k17 it would go straight to Brock since he's on the cover, or Roman Reigns for 2k18.

WWE2k14 is still 2k's best wwe game so far that got things right.",1529712000,4

I noticed that they did not fully fit my head. I don't have a big head so even on the smallest setting, these were a little loose and I felt my ear hitting the top of the headphone part.

There is no way to adjust how much to want to hear the game vs talking to someone in the headphones. On my new Turtle Beaches, you do have that and it's a great feature.

The overall sound is not bad, but it's nothing special either. You don't get the heavy bass that you would in other headphones or even your TV speakers.

The worst part of these is that they broke after about 7 months. And by broke, you could still play and hear everything but when you are playing with others, it echoes everything in your headset and also your friend's headsets. And this is EXTREMELY annoying making any game basically unplayable.

Overall, you get what you pay for. If you get these, expect them to break at some point, probably sooner than you would like. Then you would have to buy another pair.",1529884800,3

8455,228,2386,"As far as an increase in player performance, well, that's dependent on the player.  Stuff doesn't make you good, practice does.  That said, i notice a HUGE increase in my ability to snipe with these.  I love these where the movement stick is lower and the camera movement on is higher.  The lower one helps you keep grip so as you're holding run your finger doesn't slip off.  If it's the higher raised one I find it difficult to keep my thumb on it and i have to over stretch.  The higher raised one is the one you're aiming with.  The increase in height gives you more range of motion on the stick which allows you to better move a sniper scope in smaller increments.  If you need to move over a hair quickly to get the head shot, you can give the stick a kick without having to take as much effort or frustration to just move it a tiny bit.  So basically is allows for less effort to just get the aim moved a small amount.  It also works for medium ranged and the weapons of the sort too.  I also love that the pads themselves are depressed rather than raised so my finger tips have a cozy little dip to sit in which gives me better grip on the sticks.  Anything close range i really wouldn't recommend these.  With that increased range of stick movement, it makes keeping up with a close range target more difficult.  So if you run & gun, i would stick with the two lowered pads just for the grip rather than these.

Side note to KontrolFreek, i really wish you guys made more variants like these.  Most of your stuff is double raised or all the lower style.  I would love to see more like this with the camera stick raised and the lower movement stick, theres only a couple like this.  Also with the depressed grips rather than raised.  The grip is always good on both but the depressed ones, to me, give more comfort and better control.  Basically make more of this exact model with different colors/styles for both PS and Xbox.",1529884800,5

Absolutely HORRIBLE placement.  Dead center so my wired mouse cable hits it and will stop my movement.  Sometimes the cable will go on top of the little power box and raise my mouse just enough so the laser won't hit the pad and pick up the motion.  Basically you need to use your mouse on either side of this power box.  A smarter option would be to allow it to either slide so you can put the power box in the position you want, or have two plug in spots on either side of the mat so depending on placement you can switch the power box to either side.  Overall though i like it and it's good, the power box is just a huge inconvenience now and then when playing games with a corded mouse.  If you have a wireless mouse, you'll be fine.",1529884800,4

Uncharted 1: 7/10
Uncharted 2: 9/10
Uncharted 3: 8.5/10

The first Uncharted was incredibly underwhelming. The story, or lack of a story was what surprised me the most. Its very thinly written and you don't get a good sense of the characters, even by the end. Gameplay devolves into simple shooting galleries far too often with weird difficulty spikes. Uncharted 2 however fixes all of that. It features incredible set pieces after the next, while still telling a tightly written character heavy story. Uncharted 3 is a slight step back but it probably has the strongest story of the 3. The set pieces and gameplay take a step back, with a TON of hand holding scenes.",1529971200,4

8473,1644,956,"This is a great headset.

Very comfortable on my head and fits really nicely. Check the pricing daily on Amazon for these because it varies. I got them for $90 and a week later it was $150.

The sound quality is really nice, comparing it to all my other headsets, this one takes the cake every day. The bass is nice and deep but not too loud and the treble is just perfect. I really enjoy that I can take the mic out and use these as regular headphones on long trips.

There are a few reasons why I did not give five stars though.

1. I don't like how each game you play, (I'm on Xbox One) has a different level of sound. I'm not sure if this is the headset or the game but I'm constantly adjusting the mic monitoring levels from game to chat. If it means anything, this has not happened with any other headset or just my TV volume. Making me believe it is the headset itself.
2. The cable is a bit too long meaning it gets tangled a lot and caught on things ripping the headset off of your head when you are walking.
3. I don't like that there is another adapter that connects on the wire near the top of the cord. This gets ripped out here and there and then when that happens, you have to take the headset off to attach it again. This is sort of hard to explain but if you have this, I'm sure you understand.

Other than those minor things, this headset is great and I would buy it again.",1529971200,4

8504,215,3132,"Right now as of this writing there is a bug where supplies (resources) can not be obtained thus everyone dies.  Also companions disappear thus you die.  The game frame rate is beginning to stutter badly during intense high number of enemies attacks. Microsoft tried to help but they can only fix Xbox related issues.  This is a developer (Undead Labs) issue I was told.  The developer has no or very poor support system.  They just try to pawn you back off to Microsoft.  I have no choice but to wait for bug fixes that I am unsure if they even know exist or give up and sell it.  So far they have only fixed small issues that had no game ending effects as these 2 do.  Oh and of course they added downloadable pay content.  Not so sure it was even worth the 30 (now 20) bucks since we got basically a beta.

Update (7-21):  There are posts that say a patch has been out since July 3 called 2.1 but I have yet to find it and it does not install when loading the game on Xbox like all others do.  2.0 did.
Update:(7-22)  Guess there was a stealth update because all of a sudden the supply issue is resolved.  Disappearing follower issue is still very present though.  Game is playable like this but only if you don't mind dying.
Another thing is why do I seem to be the only one complaining about this when there a suppose to be 3 million users of this game?
Update (8-12)  They are stealthily fixing some things while breaking many others.
Right now zombies are spawning within solid objects.  They can not be interacted with so infestations can not be cleared.
Also mission persons are not where they are suppose to be to further the missions.  They talk but are not there and can not be interacted with.  This again makes the game UNPLAYABLE.
There are many others issues but they do not make the game unplayable like the others mentioned.
Also the vehicles that you drive are no longer visible on the map so they are easy to loose at night.
Update (8-30)  Well at least it is getting worse.  Right now I am at my base with 6 residents and none of them are anywhere to be found.  None of the prior entry bugs have been fixed.  Game seems to be flaky in just about every way.  Can't rely on much of anything to work all the time and if it does it does so in a flaky way.
Update:  (9-13-18) Characters/companions issue has been poorly fixed because now they just get lost or stuck (sometimes on the car roof) instead of disappearing altogether.  Weird things are happening all over the game like smashing into invisible walls in the middle of the road.  And an issue that has always been is those barns with the metal pole fences/gates where you bump into empty spaces and can't get through to the interior.  Open gates are not open in effect.  Also all characters seem to run into invisible walls all over the place.  The currently driven car not on the radar issue is still in effect.  Real easy to loose your vehicle at night.  I would characterize the game as totally unpolished.  Many times your companion will just stand there while you are getting killed.  Only thing the companion does extraordinarily well is get between you and the enemy when you are trying to shoot the enemy.  The follower will go to great lengths to do so too to the point of jumping in front of your face. What's up with that?  I could go on and on and maybe I will once the bugs are reduced to a manageable amount.  Also why can the enemy attack you while you are changing weapon but you can not attack them back or even move at all.  Developers keep saying you should think of the game as real because you do things the way they would happen in real life but boy do they need to practice what they preach.
10-2-18  Still no current vehicle tracking.  On the disappearing follower issue, they have digressed.  Now the follower can sometimes not even reappear if you restart the game.  Impenetrable barn/stall gates issue still there.  One stall even has loot that can not be gotten because it is behind a should be easy to jump gate and an open gate that acts like a solid wall.  Sometimes if you are near any other object trying to hit a zombie is impossible as it just swings through them.  Creatures still meld with solid objects.  Followers still get stuck on car roofs and other things.  Changing characters can many times cause you to spawn far away.  Too many more issues to list.",1530230400,2

The stand comes in a nice box, so it would make a great gift.  Keep in mind that it requires 2 AAA batteries which are not included, and you'll need a tiny screwdriver to get the battery cover off.  I used an electronics screwdriver, but a glasses repair kit will probably work too.

The stylus is larger than your normal 3DS stylus, but due to the shape of the guard (the blue part that sticks out on the sides) it isn't very comfortable to hold.  It is also flat instead of round, so it's awkward to hold.  I'm not taking a star away because I never intended to use it as a stylus because I have a large stylus I bought here on Amazon instead, but  if you wanted to use the Master Sword as a stylus, you're going to be disappointed.

I intended to use this display stand with my Wolf Link Amiibo from Twilight Princess, but I was concerned it would be too small because it is a wider Amiibo than most.  It actually fits really well.  My largest Amiibo, the Guardian from Breath of the Wild (the big machine with the tentacles, not the four heroes; the Goron hero is large but fits), ""fits"", but it only goes in one way, and it presses on the stylus in a bad way, so I would say that even though it can technically fit, it doesn't really work because that Amiibo is too big.  See picture.

When you put the sword/stylus in the stand, it makes a Zelda sword slash sound.  When you remove the sword from the stand, it plays a song.  I was hoping for the classic Zelda puzzle-discovery or treasure-obtaining songs, but it's not those, which was very disappointing. It's actually the song that plays when Link removes the Master Sword in Twilight Princess, which is appropriate, but not a memorable song like the other iconic sounds.  I removed one star for this, even though I recognize it is my personal prefernce, I think many of you Zelda fans will share it.  Still, this is a great way to display your love for the Legend of Zelda games and hold your Amiibo at the same time. Overall, I can highly recommend it to anyone, and it would make a great gift.  4/5 stars.

8507,727,3136,"I am honestly super impressed with this pad. The day I got it and tried it my original PS4 controller was put away for good! This is coming from a person who has used a PS4 controller for years. The ergonomics are really that much better! And I'm not necessarily talking about the placement of the analog sticks, as I never had an issue with the PS4's placement, but it's the outer shell where your palms rest.

Immediately I noticed input lag reduced in all my games. I always have PS4 controller plugged, so I have no idea why controller is not taking advantage of that. I think PS4 controller still communicates with Bluetooth even when plugged in, I've heard other people mention same issue.

Some people said that the triggers where a little stiff, but I noticed they are loosening it up from use, so no problem there for me. The touch pad is just like the original! I love this thing! I can't understand people complaining about it being light in weight. This is a good thing in the long run, as it becomes very comfortable for long use. I don't mind it not having a mic plug, I just use a different USB port.

Only issue I've run into is with The Last of US Remastered. Game uses PS4 controller's motion detection to turn on flashlight, which this controller doesn't have. I honestly don't blame controller though, but a stupid game design.

Though it would of been great to have rumble, given the fact that controller is plugged in and not taking battery, I'm totally cool with it.

The back trigger works really really well, and can be used to map any button, which is what I did. It's main function of slowing your aim works very well also, and it's due to the proper ergonomic placement of the back trigger. I have medium hands and everything fits perfect for me.

If you don't mind using another USB port for your headset and no rumble, I think you will love this thing!",1530230400,5

8525,44,488,"This review is for the PS4 version.

I am a bit late to the NFS games, but recently got this once it was priced under 20 bucks.  My initial disappointment with this was when I found out that it does not work with my G29 racing wheel that I had just gotten.  Granted this is more of an arcade style racing game, but my learning curve with the standard controller was a bit tough for me initially.

Graphically, the game looks very good, especially considering this game is now 3 to 4 years old.  The city feels a bit empty though with only a few cars or cops here and there.  It always seems to be dark and raining as well most of the time.

I am not sure I like the online always requirement, but at least for me, I haven't found it to be a hindrance to playing solo.  I like the ability to build up your car with better parts to help you compete in the harder events.  Initially, I found that the tutorials to help you was a bit lacking in my opinion.  The sound is decent, especially with the engine.

The different missions and events are fun but get a bit repetitive.  The racing is a bit unfair at times as it seems that you have a bit lead then suddenly the competitors catch up or you can be far behind or crash and suddenly you are directly behind the pack.  I also found it a bit irritating to be in the middle of an event and some notice flashes onto your screen, forcing you to hit dismiss in the middle of your racing event, usually messing up my race.  The main story is a bit lackluster and short to me as well.

Overall, the game is ok, but gets stale and repetitive pretty fast.

3 stars",1530403200,3
8526,44,3123,"This review is for the PS4 complete edition.

I got this game along with NFS around the holiday after they went on sale.  I have been looking for some car related games to use with my racing wheel, only to find out that both NFS and Rivals does not work with my G29 racing wheel.  Yes, this is this an arcade style racer, but I have found this game even more difficult to use with the standard controller than the NFS game, which can be a bit frustrating for a newcomer to the games like I am.

Even with my gripes with the controls, I like Rivals a bit better than the other NFS game I got.  As good as the other NFS, Rivals looks even better, with sharp looking cars and beautifully done graphics.  I really wish they would do away with the always online requirement, as I have had issues at time where I waited several minutes to connect to a server but nothing ever happened.

Being able to play the different sides with different missions and events are fun but like the other NFS, the different events get repetitive.  I do like the additional features that this game has over NFS and the story is a bit better than NFS.  I am not a online racer so I cant comment on the multiplayer features of the game.

This is an ok arcade racer game though and it has its moments of fun.  For me, the lack of wheel support and difficulty for me to adapt to the driving controls to a standard controller plus the repetitive missions make this a bit less enjoyable for me than I had hoped.

Borderlands 2 port: Freaking awful

I love the Vita dearly. I picked a bundle, because why not, but the B2 port for this system was pretty bad. The worst thing is the choppy animation and lack of animation. Things happen but you can't see them because the models just lack keyframes for any kind of feedback. Same with projectiles, most are missing or choppy. No lighting either. It makes for a frustrating and uncomfortable experience. I'm a Borderlands veteran and know this game thru and thru, but this is bad. The Nvidia Shield version makes a much better effort.

The online play frequently locks up and actually causes my Xbox One X to shut off! This happens about 20% of the time. Ive reached out to Ubisoft, but they have no response other than reinstalling the game, which isn't the problem. It ONLY locks up when playing online through their Ubisoft servers. Watch dogs 1 did not have this issue, and checking the forums, I am far from alone, yet Ubisoft refuses to release a bug patch.
Overall, its one of my favorite games, which is why Im so frustrated when the game randomly locks up hard. I have also found that there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of people playing online. The group races, or showdown events are rarely useable because of the lack of participation from online play. Id recommend this game, but be aware of its pitfalls.",1530662400,4

8559,44,3227,"This review is for the PS4 game of the year edition.

Even though it has been a long time since I played the original Dragon Age, it has stayed in my mind as a fun and memorable one.  Unfortunately, DA2 ended up as being a bit of a disappointment to me, losing some of the things that made the first DA memorable.  So I was a bit reluctant to get Inquisition as I was not sure if I would get a return to form or more of the same linear limited open world of DA2, but decided to take a chance after the price dropped to under 20 bucks.

Like the previous game, I was able to import the results from the previous games into Inquisition, which seems to affect the story a bit and character interactions, which is a nice touch to show the results of your previous games actions.  DA2 was a bit more action-oriented hack and slash kind of combat RPG, whereas DA was more of a traditional RPG with more dialogue and choices with dialogue that affects the game.  I personally preferred the gameplay of the first game than the hack and slash DA2.  Inquisition seems to have balanced that a bit more, bringing back some of the best elements of the first DA, but the combat seems to still mostly a hack and slash repeating tapping of buttons with little strategy.  Like DA2, I save often to avoid some combat frustration.

There is a bit more weapon and armor variety than in DA2 and you can even create weapons and armor with even more variation.  Like in DA2, the inventory and character menus are still a bit cumbersome to use as it is a bit of a burden to figure out which weapon/armor is best suited to the character with the same restrictions on certain weapons and armor that DA2 has.

The skill tree is back, but like DA2, it is a bit of a chore to navigate.  There are plenty of skills to choose from but I really would have liked if it was a bit more simplified that is easier to see on one screen versus the multiple you have to scroll through to find an ability you want.  As with DA2, you have a group of four characters in your party which should be diverse in order to successfully complete the various quests.

One of the best things of the first DA was the story, which I felt was lacking in DA2.  Fortunately, the story is much improved over DA2 with good characters and character interactions.

Considering this game is now 4 years old, the graphics are good and much better than the first two games, but still feel a bit dated compared to some of the newer games out now.  The various characters have good detail with smooth animation.  Like the previous games, there are camera glitches, especially during combat.  Some of the same sound glitches that have occurred in DA2, where there is no sound or doesnt match the characters, occur on occasion.  You would think that some of the bugs from the previous game would have been fixed for this one.

One of my big gripes with DA2 was the limited game world map that used the same areas with very little variety throughout the game.  Inquisition has a lot more depth with a variety of areas to explore.  There are still some limitations with the game world but the tremendous number of places to explore and things to do makes for a great improvement over DA2.  If anything, there may be too much to do and explore here.  There are also some new elements added such as the war table, similar to some of the AC games.  For me, I am not so sure I like that part of the game, but your actions open up new areas to explore, without having to navigate all over the map to find the areas.  As it is with games that have a lot of quests (main/side), some are more interesting than others and get a bit repetitive after a while.

There are plenty of interesting characters to interact with and the voice acting is good decent for the most part.  The various party members have different skill sets and background stories that are affected by your game decisions, which provides some depth to the game.

To me, the different menu interfaces seems a bit dated and could have been better done overall as it all seems a bit clunky in my opinion.

The game balance is better with lots of places to explore and a good story that is affected by the multiple character interactions.  Combat is a bit too simplified and there are some of the same glitches from the past games but overall is an improvement over DA2 and fun to play, but some quests are bland and monotonous.  To me, this is a decent game overall, but not as good as the first DA game and I like the Elder Scroll series a bit better.

8588,1113,823,"A bad review of Breath of the Wild? This game is a final Wii U game, developed on this format so for the longest time it was called ""Zelda Wii U"" during pre-release  days. I have to say the fact that many first party Nintendo games are still full-priced at around $60 even after discontinuation of the system is enough reason for me to deduct a point from any of those games. Another star would of been deducted if this game had extensive DLC like other games these days... what you really get here is a $80 game considering the Expansion Pass you basically need to purchase separately to get the ""full experience""... Anyhow, I didn't deduct the points for the game's price, but more seriously because it doesn't feel like a true Zelda game to me. Zelda's in it and so is Link... but it's another one of those 1 player games trying to be an MMO by structuring itself with ""open world content"" games where you are lead by the nose by ""Missions"" rather than the game's over-arching plot. The problem being that getting lost is part of the game's forte. Link must procure items & weapons & clothing on-site. Basically find a sword somewhere, beat the monsters down til your weapon explodes from being destroyed and then grab a disarmed monster's club to beat him down with. There's some babble about Link having lost his memory (and possibly his mojo) but what I hate about this game is there's no dungeons. Dungeons make and break a Zelda game and the lack of them breaks this one. Another thing is the wolf-LInk amiibo. I'm not sure if the wolf-Link is an option in the Switch version since Twilight Princess wasn't released on that format so basically you cannot raise the HP of the wolf-Link companion....",1530748800,3

8591,135,3136,"I mainly play shooters so i was looking for a backup controller to my Scuf Impact and stumbled across the Hori FPS Plus. Now i owned all of the Xbox consoles so i am very familiar with the stick layout but have zero issues with the dualshock 4 layout. Upon opening the Hori I wad not super impressed
 Yes i knew it was going to be light due to not having the vibration motors but it just seemed kinda cheap and plasticky.  Its similar to the 360 controller design and didn't feel that bad in my hands. Loaded up Fortnite and any negative feelings about the controller disappeared immediately.  The triggers despite how they appear in pictures work great.  I can swap weapons with L1 and R1 so much faster it isn't funny. Then the L2 and R2 have shorter travel distance than that of the dualshock 4 or my Scuf and makes it much easier to win gunfights.  My accuracy also seems much better this far. My kills per match has doubled easily. Also note there is no headphone jack but I use a wireless controller so i don't need it. And the instructions are in Japanese so you will need them translated to figure out the special buttons. Im not using them nor did i plan to so i haven't used rhe turbo feature. Still great controller for the price.
EDIT....forgot to mention that the cable is about 9ft long which is far too long for my desktop setup. I have it tied off so im not tripping on it
 Also its a cheap rubber which tangles easily. Which it was braided and removable like the one on the Nacon Revolution version 2. That way it could be replaced if damaged or switched with a much shorter cable for people that don't need a 9ft cable",1530921600,5
8592,60,767,"I really want to like this mouse. I own a lot of gaming mice that I have purchased over the past two years. Probably more along the line of a dozen now. The G602 is just a ok mouse for gaming in my collection.

Here's why:
1) Its heavy and has a bigger handprint. To give you an idea, its much more heavier than a Logitech G502 (of which I also own). There is a lot of rubber making this heavier than plastic. The two batteries don't make it any lighter either. I'm not a fan of heavy mice as it creates hand fatigue for me.
2) The scroll wheel isn't anything like the G502. It doesn't spin freely and doesn't click firmly either. It has more of a loose spinning friction feel to it than a locking one.
3) The 6 side buttons are a little too small bezel wise and have a not so smooth edge feel to it. Its not bad, better than the MMO mice I have. However, what I don't like is the position of the buttons farthest to the foot of the mouse. They are way too far back. This causes me to reposition my hand to get to them and really kink my thumb backwards. In fast FPS games, this doesn't work well for me as my entire palm and fingers shift backward.
4) Scroll wheel clicks to the left and right side feel awkward and take too much effort to perform. This, unlike the G502 which is way easier.

What I like about it:
1) Losing the cord is great. I love not having it hit anything on my desk.
2) The rubber feet are very good too and glide easily.
3) The rubber top feels good and gives more grip than mice that use plastic tops at the palm

If Logitech could remove some of the rubber on this mouse and make it more lighter and change the position of the 6 side buttons to be moved farther up toward the front of the mouse by 1/2"", this would be a top 5 on my list. But as it stands, I can't give it that. Its good, but not the best.",1530921600,3

8611,725,1021,"(First, a word about this particular edition: whereby the vanilla version of this game would receive four stars, this one gets five. The DLCs have so much satisfying content and the main game is given a drizzle of extra lore that fits comfortably with the rest of the narrative. Also, there's an optional final boss added. We all want that.)
The fire is fading in the kingdom of Drangleic. The gods have all vanished and the whole land is in considerable decay; humans, all in various stages of hollowing or corruption, wander this world in search of purpose, alone under the dragon-dotted sky. Or are they? Perhaps there are other manifestations of the Dark still lurking in the shadows of Vendrick's kingdom. This kingdom, by the way, while not as impressively laid out as Lordran from the first game, does not fall short in creativity. To be honest, this might be my favorite Soulsborne game (specifically this edition). There's more content in it than any of the other games, both in terms of equipment and the number of areas to explore. True enough, it is graphically the least impressive but, mechanically, it has the soundest inventory system by far and some really terrific customization. Combat is much harder to get used to but, man...get your hands on an ultra-greatsword first chance you get.
People throw a lot of shade on this game. ""Hollowing is done badly""; it's still better than how it is in Demon's Souls and Darks Souls 3. ""You can't farm enemies as much""; burn bonfire ascetics or go to another area--there are plenty. ""Too many humanoid enemies""; well, it's consistent with the story--play Bloodborne if you want more beasts. In short, just because it seems to be a lesser game than its predecessor does not mean it's altogether bad. And if you're coming to this from Bloodborne or Dark Souls 3...well, slow down a bit, I guess.",1531094400,5

8641,677,1142,"Dragon Age Inquisition is a game I have mixed feelings for. It has a lot of potential, which unfortunately was held back by a simultaneous release for the PS3 and Xbox360. I think if the game was developed solely for current gen consoles, most of the issues wouldnt exist  muddy textures, graphical bugs, lag, audio sync issues, etc.  But before I get into my dislikes and nit picks, lets talk about the things I DID enjoy.

1. Voice acting is well done. Obviously the background banter and lesser NPCs aren't anything to be impressed about, but talking to party members or other main characters, the delivery is good.

2. I think making the attack button a trigger button instead of X or [ ], is a pretty neat idea. Obviously they needed to free up the face buttons for spells, so it makes sense

3. Being able to switch to multiple characters on the field and having additional party members to sub in and out is nice. It is fun to be able to switch to a ranged character if you are more of a melee build.

4. The story for the most part is fine. There is a time travel section that I enjoyed a lot. Base story isn't overly convoluted, which helps when you come back after long gaps in your play time.

5. Romancing your party members is fun and totally worth it just for Cassandra alone. Her arc is delightful.

Now let me break down some of the neutral or nitpicky stuff.

1. Models seem overall stiff when compared to other RPGs of the time  Witcher 3 for example. Pretty sure this is due to last gen development - so models, textures, etc, had to be kept simpler.

2. There are instances where items will pass through characters body as they are talking. For instance, Dorian has a staff and when you are introduced to him, he has a long dialog section where he gestures with his hand so the staff he is holding clips through his body constantly. Looks messy. Also a couple of times characters would be missing shoulders or small parts of their arms during dialog sections.

3. Dialog choices often times seems to have no consequence to the story. Sure your party member may not enjoy you being rude to that elf, but nothing bad will directly happen because of it. Something The Witcher 3 does much better.

4. Many times you will walk through areas with people and you won't hear them talk. Often enough they are just standing around like statues and not on any sort of loop. Again, witcher 3 does this better.

5. The horse is ok I guess, except for when you want to go fast. You hit L3 and you get a blurry, zoomed view that SEEMS like you are going faster, but honestly just kind of makes me nauseous.

6. Way too many side quests that require you to fetch animal hides, or flowers, or other crafting material. You will waste a lot of playtime not actually DOING anything.
7. Speaking of crafting mats, anytime you want to upgrade your potions you need about 30 of some plant, and you will be wandering around looking for it and waiting for nodes to respawn. If I wanted to play WOW I would.

Now for the truly heinous parts of the game

1. The war table is ok in theory, but realistically it is designed to waste your time. As you complete quests you are awarded points to use toward your war table actions. The table will give you options of what to pursue with different point allocation to unlock it  perhaps you are awarded some gold, some influence, or a new area is unlocked. Typically the points to accept the missions range from 10  30. So you need to work on the side quests to get a few points to do anything at the war table. Even then, there is a timer for each mission. Sometimes it is fast 10 minutes, other times it can be an hour. So then you have to wait. Boy thats fun.

2. Speaking of wasting your time. The game LOVES to make your exploration very difficult. Paths to your quest destination are very obtuse and often blocked by a cliff or invisible barrier. So you have to go ALL THE WAY AROUND instead of trying to hop up some seemingly reachable stone steps. It would be a lot easier if your character had some sort of grab animation to pull him up on a ledge. Instead you are left with a pathetic jump. (witcher 3 was better)

3. Lag. Oh goodness the lag. Unavoidable. If you play on xbox X or on a PS4 Pro you will be lucky to get a solid 30 FPS (not even 60, boooo), but on a base console, you will typically lose about 3-5 frames in just about any situation or environment. I can live with that for the most part. But I have experienced lag so bad, it made me want to stop playing. In Skyhold, my game dropped to the teens, easily. It made dialog audio out of sync and ruined a lot of neat cut scenes. Thankfully, after I quick travelled to the Hinterlands, it seemed to sort itself out. HOWEVER, the WORST was yet to come. I had lag in the Exalted Plains SO TERRIBLY AWFUL STINKING BAD that my game turned into a slideshow. No kidding. Single digit frames. So so so so bad. Going into my options was brutal and made playing the game impossible as you need to be able to react to attacks. I don't know what causes it, but I haven't seen lag that bad since playing Fallout New Vegas on PS3. Yes, that bad.

So as you can see, the game leaves a weird taste in my mouth. There are a lot of things that are simply done better in Witcher 3, and I would just recommend playing that, it is amazing.  If this game was developed for newer hardware, it could have been a 4 star game, easily. But the fact that the last gen held it back puts it at 3. The lag hurts it even further and drops it to 2 stars. But if you are a fan of the series and want more Dragon Age, then get it on the cheap. Anything under 20 bucks seems reasonable.",1531353600,2
8642,691,1089,"Super fun game but with some questionable practices.
So let's review.
I bought XL for 30.00$.
I want to unlock all brutalities and have learned that they made this unnecessarily cumbersome in hopes you go for the 20.00$ unlocked all in krypt, main issue there is the full game cost me 30.00$ new, so WTF?
Why does DLC never seem to depreciate in value?
I'm not coughing up an additional two thirds of the game's price to unlock peripherals and other things that quite frankly shouldn't be locked.
Also, wanna pick a faction NP pick one, want to change factions? Oh well ya gotta go on-line for that.
Sure makes sense to me, but are you sure, Netherealms, that you aren't in cohoots with Sony to maximize their on-line profits?
Cause Im currently not paying for PS on-line as this is the only game I have that requires me to, in order to experience what I want to experience.
60$ for on-line PS services, 20 $ for all unlocked and 30 $ for the game, makes this a 110.00 $ game.
For shame, Noob Saibot, (you know who you are)

PS
Why would they make the 10 second transformation scene of Korrupted Shinnok be skippable but not the endings!?!?!?!?!?! I have to sit through them every time and its starting to get old, and stupid.
Also, back and throw with Scorpion supposed it leads into a brutality but that one and a handful of others, simply don't work for me.
Its not a technical failure on my part, holding back and then pressing the throw button to kill your opponent is very easy so, again, what the hell?!?!?
The way they have handled this, I wouldnt be surprised if you either have to go on-line or unlock everything in the krypt before those select brutalities are unlocked .
And now that I had to write this out in a review, and realized that I had none of these issues in MK9, this just went from a 3 star to a 2 star review for a 5 star game, because of greed and stupidity.",1531440000,2

The casing in which the game came in, was smashed up in certain places. As if it was being crushed somehow. There were pieces that seem to have broken off & were inside the casing when I opened it. I haven't had this happen before but I have had other issues similar to this with a UPS delivery person. The odd thing was that the sticker on the package had a USPS delivery person's last name on it, which was ""Diaz"". I'm not sure why that was, but it was definitely there. Now, with all of that being said, the game itself was still in pristine condition & is definitely playable. Item arrived on time & was definitely reminiscent of the original Resident Evil games of the past & had some new twists & features that others seem to lack in. Graphically, for an Xbox360 console, I found it amazing. Interesting storyline & fun gameplay.

8694,505,2451,First of all I'd like to state that this product is not worth $40. I do not care if it's a brand it is not worth $40. The very fact that the BlazBlue version is double if not triple the price. It feels very light flimsy and extremely fragile.. Even though this is possibly the best controller I could find for myself do to comfort and quality. It passes Comfort but the quality definitely needs work. the turbo works as it should as does everything else the very fact that I'm able to turn the d-pad at a certain degree is also really awesome. But this controller needs to be touched up. I almost feel like if I just squeeze it hard enough it's just going to straight up crack or Worse break. It is very prone to scratches and it definitely shows. I've only had it for just the day and already is looking like garbage. I like how long the wire is but even the wire itself looks dreadfully cheap. Lower the price or I'm not buying this controller again if it breaks. Doesn't even have an audio jack.

8727,763,3250,"Another fantastic release by Capcom. To the guy who gave it 2 stats because Legacy Collection 2 is downlad only, I say suck it up. We are getting megaman 11 and MAYBE even a new Megaman X game. So regardless of capcoms practices, just suck it up so we can save the megaman series to continue with the future to show that hey we still love megaman.

Pretty much has the same features as the Megaman legacy collection for the switch, this time there is only a few new featues.

The megaman x series has always held a special place in my heart, I love megaman sure but the X series was like the edgy megaman. It was so dark and gritty for a megaman game, compared to the others. Zero is my favorite character, he is a cool character and even had his own series on the GBA. Megamans X desgin is also my favorite, overall this is a great series. I really wish I had some kind of megaman x figure.

New features are Ok, the most noticeable feature is the new X challenge mode where you can fight two bosses at once, yikes. There is also an animated prequel film called ""The Day of { ""

Overall really nice, espeshally for the price.",1532390400,5
8728,85,3250,"This is the one I've been waiting for! I love the Mega Man X games! The first Mega Man legacy collection was fun and I enjoyed seeing the NES games agian, but they're really dated. My kids would barely even look at them... This X collection is fun for me, and my son is having a lot of fun with it too!! It looses a star because of some technical issues on the Switch, but I love these games and certainly suggest them!

These are some of the best run and gun platform games ever. The fact that you can beat the bosses and take their weapons was a very unique gimmick that added to the gameplay. It's also really awesome that you can play the stages in whatever order you want. And you get eight complete Mega Man X games here so you get a ton of great games! From best to worst, I would number these: X1, X2, X4, X5, X3, X8, X6, and X7. The earlier ones are definitely better, and X7 isn't worth playing. In fact, if you don't want the whole series, you can buy just the first half digitally for half the price.

Pros:
-You get all 8 of the main games in one collection. You don't get the two gameboy games, but they were pretty poor games anyway.
-The controls are very good and it's totally playable in handheld or tv mode. I like it with the pro controller a lot better, but I've enjoyed it on the go also.
-they brought the achievement system to the Switch and call them ""medals"".
-The rookie Hunter mode has made it easier for my younger kids to play.
-There is a boss rush mode that doesn't seem to be amazing, but the extra is nice.
-the art and music galleries are interesting to go through at least once.

Cons:
-X5 thorugh X8 are a digital download code and not on the cartridge. I don't know if it's the cartridge cost or just to kill resale value. Either way, it means I can't play the full series on both my Switch and my kids' Switch! Yes, X6 and X7 aren't worth playing, but I bought physical because I want physical!
-There's framerate stuttering on X1-X3. It's occasional and doesn't kill playability, but it shouldn't be there. There also is emulated slowdown that originally was on the SNES too. I would have liked to see that taken out too, but I understand it's intentional.
-no save state support. You can only save between stages. It makes it closer to the original password function, but I would have loved a save anywhere approach--especially when playing on the go! It's worked pretty well to just pause the game and put the Switch to sleep.

They're not perfect, but this is a great collection. Overall, this is awesome for a Meg Man X fan. I also think it's a much better introduction to the series than the original legacy collection. The Switch version has a stutter that I hope gets fixed, but I love having these games on the go.",1532390400,5

I hate playing games with people who have no idea how they are sounding, and what their mic is actually picking up and broadcasting to everyone. This makes me into a more polite professional gamer. Also being able to quickly prioritize voice chat over game audio, Or mute either one all together is perfect! It's annoying talking with your friends and having to put up with loud game audio, or music when you load your game or sit at the menu. No longer do you have to fumble around in the game settings, only to figure out you can't change the title menu music. This device solves it all. Now for the neutral and negative parts: The price obviously is one. Another is that this seems like it was best designed for PC gaming. The reason I say that is because it's annoying having to stretch the USB and fiber optic cables across your living room, worry about stepping on the fiber optic cable, and having to put it away carefully when your done. Also, I don't like having to switch the cables from Xbox to PS4 all the time. I'd keep the fiber optic plugged into my TV, but then there's a slight audio delay from having to route the audio to an extra place. Yes, I know I'm very lucky to have two console's, but still! Just because of the cables, I think this device is best used at a desk with a PC. But, I still love it. It will be nice once wireless headphones become good enough, but until then, this is my favorite.",1532390400,4
8734,1613,939,"This case was a good price, and I bought it because it holds more games and accessories than some of the other cases listed. I read some of the other reviews, and decided to give it a chance. It would be better in my opinion if it had a handle, or some kind of strap, but it still does the job of protecting the 3ds, and it's still pretty easy to carry around. The smell: Yeah, it smells bad, which makes me think it was made very cheaply. Mine smells kinda like cigarettes or burnt rubber. Not good at all, but unless you're constantly sticking your nose in it,  you probably won't notice. The removable liner was tight and hard to get the 3ds into. It's not even worth using, as it doesn't fully cover the 3ds, and the system should be just fine in the main case without it. Plus, the memory card holder flap is soft and rests in between the system and accessory pocket. It was very hard to get the game cartridges to fit in the slots though... I suspect it would become easier once you stretch the fabric and insert/remove them a few times. All in all, it's an OK case, but I'm going to look around and see what else is out there.",1532390400,3
8735,464,193,"The performance is great. Keys need very little pressure, are smooth and feel great. The only reason I cant give 5 stars is the keyboard has a tendency to slide a little. Its not constant but it does happen.",1532476800,4
8736,464,3200,"great graphics and gore. The story doesnt  really rope you in but the action is what makes the game great. Also the music is very unique, The wrote several versions of each song so that the more enemies you're fighting and crazy the combat gets the music will pick up and get heavier and makes for some exciting moments.",1532476800,5
8737,594,3252,great game,1532476800,5
8738,133,1030,The story is awesome and I love the stack system.  It's kind of like Pokemon. I really like the stack system.  Make sure to get water creatures be for going to the pirate zone.  I got stuck there because I didn't have the right creatures.,1532563200,5
8739,173,1252,"They sound great. Mid level entry that just works and sound good. I just love these headphones. I have big ears and these are so comfortable. I'm a computer system admin and I use these every day, both at work and at home. Sounds great for my music and for the odd video game(s) I occasionally play. They work immediately on all (5) pc's/laptops I have at my home, and on 4 of the pc's I use as an admin at work. Just beautiful. they are so easy to use, connects so easily. they are very sturdy, sensible ""on"" button, (in the middle of the head phone ""cover"", with the sound up and down to the right and left of the power on button. I wear them about 8-10 hours a day, and they are super comfortable. The battery life is, and get this...at least as good as the 40 hours stated. I can run them for a bit longer it seems to me. They adhere to my head easily, but will not hurt ears and are very comfortably snug. No pain or ear problems at all. Connection is super easy and works well. They do cut out after you leave the ""default"" area, but they tell you this. the only knock is be careful with the ""flap"" where you plug it in to recharge. I have to use my fingernails to get it open now, but to me this could be inherent to my unit only. Did I say I just love these? Support is the best, and I'll be an Avantree customer for life. They go an extra ""2"" miles to resolve any issue you might have. They are a great company and I've already recommended them to some of my colleagues. Well done Anantree.",1532563200,5
8740,259,3253,"I bought this as a replacement for the integrated keyboard on my laptop since it was getting worn out. I've long been a fan of the SteelSerise products and this keyboard doesn't disappoint. It has a nice weighty feel to each of the keypresses well having enough to give to not get in the way of typing. There is a really nice click to each press as well, although it's not the loudest I've ever heard. The weight and construction of the keyboard is also wonderful, with it not being overly heavy, but still extremely durable. As always the level of customizability for the keyboard is wonderful, with you being able to choose plenty of flashy effects or just a mat color. I've not run into any problems with the keyboard as of yet, but I've not removed the keys for cleaning or anything intensive. Overall I think it's a fantastic keyboard if you're interested in getting a luxury one.",1532563200,5

8758,1533,1863,"I recieved this amiibo to add to my Zelda collection.  It is used in different games, including Smash Bros and Breath of the Wild for the Wii U.  In Smash, you can level up the character data stored on the amiibo, and in Breath of the Wild she unlocks a stealth helm and daily treasure chest drops.

8770,1683,887,"I bought this controller to replace my Dual-Action controller. This just works automatically with Xbox-mapping instead of having to use xfce360 which doesn't work with all games and is a pain to deal with. It just works right out of the box on Windows 10...there is software you can install for customizing the controller but I didn't need it for the games I play. Also the triggers are analog which may come in handy, whereas the Dual-Action only has buttons for the trigger.  I recommend this for playing multi-platform video games that are on PC...anymore games are geared towards consoles and this gives the best of both worlds...PC graphics with a console-controller.",1532995200,5
8771,1683,887,"It feels natural and is pretty much like the Xbox and PS4 controllers we have with those consoles. The  connection has been great with no lost connections or lags. Im not the big gamer in my family, but those who use this controller say they are very comfortable with it and using it is easy and intuitive. Now of course, they want me to get more, which I probably will do since they seem so pleased.",1532995200,5
8772,1683,887,We needed another wireless control for our Xbox. It was bought as a Christmas present & delivered promptly. My 10 year old paired it up with ease. It's sturdy & well made. Would definitely buy another.,1532995200,5

Came well packaged and was delivered when said. I have only been using it a few hours, so I cannot comment on durability but so far so good.",1532995200,5
8778,1683,887,"Great controller for the PC. I bought this as I wanted to play a few PC games that I felt more comfortable with using a pad. Bought it and as soon as I plugged it in, connected straight away and worked perfectly. Love it.",1532995200,5
8779,1683,887,"Easy to pair to Wii U and although I've only tried it with Breath of The Wild and Mario Kart 8, it appears to work well and is very responsive. Two included thumb grips are also handy, but do seem a bit loose on the odd occasion. Very good overall",1532995200,5
8780,448,3259,"I wanted a HOTAS for my PC, but didn't feel like getting another one for my PS4. Fortunately, the only HOTAS compatible with PS4 is actually quite good. I mostly use it on PC for Elite Dangerous, but it works well. It took a moment to make sense of how it configured on PC, but it was worth it.

If you see anything about codes for War Thunder, ignore it. The one I got was expired.",1532995200,4
8781,1683,887,"Incredible gamepad, works perfectly every single time. I couldn't ask for anything more. I didn't realize it came with a hidden usb dongle inside the controller itself! That makes an almost instant connection to the pc. Customizing controls are easy",1532995200,5
8782,1683,887,"For the price, this PC controller is hard to beat. The xinpit/directinput switch on the back ensures you can easily play games designed for the x-box controller (most on PC these days I find) without it's limitations. It feels good in my hands and has lasted quite a few couch gaming parties. I've got four of these and prefer them over XBox One controllers. If you are used to using XBox One controllers, this will feel much lighter. If you play a wide variety of PC games with a controller, I highly advise this product.",1532995200,5

8785,1683,887,This is my second controller I have bought and only because I ran over the wire with my chair by accident and broke the cable.

8786,1683,887,I just got this controller and I haven't had any problems with it yet. I'm very glad that there's an alternative to the expensive pro controllers.

8788,1683,887,"Being able to charge via cable that you're probably already carrying around for your iOS device is a really smart feature on this thing.

8808,1683,887,"Seems to be a solid, good quality controller. I haven't used the official Nintendo Wii U Pro Controller so can't compare it to that, but having used Xbox/Xbone/PS4 controllers, this feels comparable in build quality.",1533081600,5
8809,1683,887,"I don't have an original to compare it to but this is an excellent controller. Works well, has a solid feel and is comfortable in the hands. Can't really say much more than that.",1533081600,5

Symmetrical analog sticks, a great dpad (compared to 360 at least), solid buttons, and outstanding battery life that'll last me over a month even if I play a few hours every single day.

8842,1686,887,"Bought this for super smash bros. It is a great controller for the money. The analog sticks feel very nice and responsive. The only problem I have with it is the shiny black finish, as it gets fingerprints very easily.",1533168000,5
8843,1686,887,it isn't a perfect substitute for the offical nintendo version; but it get the job done for it's price! haven't had a problem with it yet and it has been 3 months!,1533168000,5
8844,1686,887,My son has wanted these for months. We finally got him some for Christmas and he says they work great. We haven't had any problem with them and they get their share of use.,1533168000,5
8845,1686,887,"amazing addition to your wii u console. the controller that comes with the wii u is a bit too big, but this one is great and works amazingly",1533168000,5
8846,1686,887,This controller is well made. The battery lasts for several weeks of play time (a couple hours a day). It is lighter than using the game pad for hours of playing when you don't need the small screen. I can recommend it.,1533168000,5
8847,1686,887,"No issues with this controller- works just as good as the Nintendo pro controller. You can't tell by the picture, but it has a soft, sleek vinyl coat which feels great in your hands and adds a nice matte finish.",1533168000,5
8848,1686,887,Seriously considering using this controller for Smash for Wii U. This is by far the greatest controller I've ever used. The battery life is phenomenal as well.,1533168000,5
8849,1686,887,i already bought one in gamestop and now i got one for my brother so we can smash bros together! excellent controller,1533168000,5
8850,1686,887,My son loves this controller and loves the fact that it is wireless! Product was just as described and was shipped very quickly!,1533168000,5
8851,1686,887,"This controller has performed flawlessly for me. The battery lasts a long time, unlike the battery for the Gamepad. And the controller is light, so it won't fatigue the hands like the heavier Gamepad will during long play sessions.",1533168000,5
8852,1686,887,Controller Came in yesterday works perfectly Good to play smash bros with instead of using the Tablet.,1533168000,5
8853,1686,887,Awesome controllers! We are very happy with them and the seller. Highly recommend!,1533168000,5
8854,1686,887,"Only one con though, its really difficult to walk slowly in games like smash, even if I barely tilt the thumb stick to move, I end up running. I'm not sure if the normal wiiu pro controller has this issue too but its just something I'd like to point out.",1533168000,5
8855,1686,887,We purchased this controller during the black friday sale and are happy with the results so far. It feels like an xbox controller so that made the switch from the little wii u stick controller much easier for my kid to use. I probably should have bought two seeing as I now have to use the stick controller.,1533168000,5
8856,1686,887,"purchased for a commerical facility that offers Smash Bro's on the Wii U. They work exactly as expected, have a good battery life, and the texture is a matte rubbery feel. Highly Recommended.",1533168000,5
8857,1686,887,"The sticks seem a bit too long, the face buttons require a bit too much pressure to hold down, and the bumpers aren't in the most convenient spot. However, it is a solid, capable controller that exceeds what I normally expect from a 3rd party offering.",1533168000,5
8858,1686,887,"No problems with charing or holding a charge, buttons, sticks, and triggers all feel responsive. The controller feels great in the hands.",1533168000,5
8859,1686,887,works fine no problem so far . cordless is a plus,1533168000,5
8860,1686,887,Phenomenal product one of the best controllers I've used!!!!!,1533168000,5
8861,1686,887,"Works great, long range, longer battery life. Its a bit bigger than I was expecting but that is not a problem.",1533168000,5
8862,1686,887,"Best control scheme to play games on wii u, after the gamepad of course... I use it every day to play mario kart and its very conforttable to hold and use, all the buttons are very accesible and the battery life last for weeks..",1533168000,5
8863,1686,887,"Of all the non Nintendo suppliers for the Wii, Nyko appear to make the best gear, and this is no exception. A real quality feel and look, my six year old won't play with anything else now!",1533168000,5
8864,1686,887,Everything about this thing is amazing! The battery life and build quality surprised me to be quite honest - definitely a step over the PS4/XB1 controller! Definitely more comfortable & easy to use than the Wii Remote Plus and the Wii U gamepad.,1533168000,5
8865,1686,887,"some people i think mention issues with the dpad, which is somewhat true at times but most of the time like 95% using it i had no issues with it, sure its not as high quality as the 1st party dpad but its not enough of an issue to myself as is. thanks to this vendor for a superb product!",1533168000,5
8866,1686,887,Fantastic controller. Love that it's chargeable! Has saved me a ton in batteries.,1533168000,5
8867,1686,887,The controller has a nice grip to it. Dont have an issue with the d-pad like other reviewers have mentioned. All around probably a better controller than nintendo's pro controller.,1533168000,5
8868,1686,887,Got two of these for the price of 1 nintendo controller. They feel good and the WiiU has USB ports on the back for charging as well. No problem syncing or handling during games.,1533168000,5
8869,1686,887,"For the price I got this controller for it was a steal, Picture sort of makes it look flat to me, its a lot like an XBOX 360 controller.",1533168000,5
8870,1686,887,"Much better than using a Wii-mote in Super Mario 3D World. Battery lasted about 20 hours of game play before needed recharge, and that was over a several week period. Will buy another if I run into a game that would need another.",1533168000,5
8871,1686,887,Way less expensive than the name brand Nintendo product. Feels like a slightly smaller xbox 360 controller. Good controller with no compromises.,1533168000,5
8872,1686,887,"I've seen some criticism of the d-pad but it honestly seems fine to me; I gave Super Mario Bros a test run just to try out the d-pad. I don't think I have any complaints, so I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an extra Wii U controller to have on hand.",1533168000,5
8873,1686,887,"These are great! They work perfectly, love that they are rechargeable. The kids fight over who is going to use them next. They are actually the """"pro"""" type of controller so don't hesitate, just buy them!",1533168000,5
8874,1686,887,We needed to get this so my son could play the 2 player games on Disney Infinity. It appears to be pretty sturdy and perfect for little hands as well as adults.,1533168000,5
8875,1686,887,"The first comment I get from anyone that uses it for the first time is ""This feels awesome"" (which indeed It does). I can use this thing an entire afternoon and the battery would still show full bars.",1533168000,5
8876,1686,887,"This is my go to controller for my Wii U. The button placement is more natural than the official Wii U Pro Controller (which I also own), and the triggers actually feel like triggers instead of buttons.",1533168000,5
8877,1686,887,"Love these controllers, they are just as good as the Wii U brand and half the price. You charge them via USB plugged into the Wii U, and the charge lasts for a very long time. Has a nice grip in your hands and seems pretty durable.",1533168000,5
8878,1686,887,"I like the placement of the sticks and it doesn't feel too light. I wish that the buttons would light up blue though, that would have been very cool.",1533168000,5
8879,1686,887,"This is an excellent controller for the Wii U, especially for those who prefer the Xbox 360 design. One issue I have with it, though, all the pictures of it show the A button at the bottom, like the 360 controller, but it isn't actually there. The button layout is exactly like Nintendo controllers. It's a minor problem, but it's there.",1533168000,5
8880,1686,887,Really comfortable for hours of game play and I high recommend it.,1533168000,5
8881,1686,887,"I was concerned about quality with this being cheaper than the first party controller but I'm quite pleased with it. The entire controller is rubberized so it grips well, and it feels nice. No complaints.",1533168000,5
8882,1686,887,"Really pleased with this controller, so much nicer to use than the giant wii u pad for most games. The battery life is good and the pad hasn't had any compatibility issues with games I've used it for so far (Mario kart and breath of the wild).",1533168000,5
8883,1686,887,"I recommend this, no issues at all!! We have dropped it at least 5 times I know of so it can take some abuse..",1533168000,5
8884,1686,887,"Very ergonomic controller. Easy button layout, huge improvement on joystick positioning. Not once did I have to look at controller to find buttons like on the pro controller. I recommend this to anyone who has had a play station or Xbox controller because of. The positioning of the right thumbstick.",1533168000,5
8885,1686,887,"Feels great in your hands. Stays charged long enough for most games. No issues what so ever. For the price, its a GREAT buy.",1533168000,5
8886,1686,887,really nice controller. Very glad that it is rechargeable rather than having to deal with batteries.,1533168000,5
8887,1686,887,I bought this controller months ago and I have only charged it when I first got it. I use it about 4 times a week.,1533168000,5
8888,1686,887,"It still shocks me that the Wii U doesn't come with, you know, an actual controller. If for some reason you accidentally end up with a Wii U, this is basically a mandatory purchase.",1533168000,5
8889,1686,887,"Awesome controller, fits in hands perfectly long battery life",1533168000,5
8890,1686,887,Very good controller! It fits perfectly in my hands and is very durable! I can't remember the number of times I've thrown it out of sheer anger. Thanks for the quick shipping!,1533168000,5
8891,1686,887,I love this thing. The material is grippy but easy to clean. The size is just right and teh battery lasts a very long time.,1533168000,5
8892,1686,887,wow....it looks good feels good and most importently it works great...it didn't come with the cable to charge it but improvised and used my ps3 controler charger...other thin that its great...,1533168000,5
8893,1686,887,"Great control for the Wii u plus price is great compared to the official Wii u controller, looks good does not light up but works fine no complaints..",1533168000,5
8894,1686,887,"Pretty good quality for the price, I don't have a Nintendo pro controler so I can not make a comparison.",1533168000,5
8895,1686,887,My only complaint is that it doesn't use bluetooth so if anyone plans on using this controller with their PC it will not work but other than that its a cheaper and incredibly useful alternative controller for the Wii U.,1533168000,5
8896,1686,887,Pretty good controller if you are on a budget. I have no complaints.,1533168000,5
8897,1686,887,"We have two of these at home and they work great and I just got a third one for my nephew, he loves it. Great price and alternative to the name brand controllers.",1533168000,5
8898,1686,887,I say that this product is best and closest to the wii u pro classic controller. Plus the sellers that I got it from did a good job of making sure the my package made it through.,1533168000,5
8899,1686,887,I bought the official Nintendo pro controller and this one. This controller was way cheaper. My kids actually prefer this controller. It's a little smaller than the Nintendo controller but it otherwise works exactly the same.,1533168000,5
8900,1686,887,am so used to having the 2nd analog stick below the buttons that I just could not get used to the wii u pad or pro controller. They ahd the best thing going with the gamecube controller layout. Why they went and messed with it is beyond me.,1533168000,5
8901,472,3261,i love the lights on this,1533168000,5
8902,1687,3262,This doesn't work with the PS4. Poor buy,1533168000,1
8903,1687,2023,I love this setting and the adventures with it. Great spend,1533168000,5
8904,756,816,"I didn't enjoy this game as much as I thought I would. Its mostly a puzzle like game firguing out how to get around one obstacle to the next. Good graphics, but still kinda boring for my taste.",1533168000,3
8905,1686,887,The control is beautiful . Super cmodo y preciso. . Super comfortable and very well built. The battery life is amazing. I'm very happy with the purchase.,1533168000,5
8906,1686,887,"Love this pro controller, its very confortable, I have used it in assasins creed black flag, fifa, mario 3d world, need for speed, and it works perfectly, sticks feel good and what absolutely love and why you should have one too is that the battery lasts forever, I ve only charged once and its benn 15 day and its still on full charge. Excellent product.",1533168000,5
8907,1686,887,Needed this as an accessory for Wii U as there weren't enough controllers. Does the job!,1533168000,5

8924,44,0,"This review is for the PS4 version.

After recently finishing DA: Inquisition and dealing with some of the frustrations of the gameplay in terms of the environment and character movement, the smoothness of the game world and character movement felt refreshing with this game.  HZD feels in a lot of ways similar to the Far Cry games with a bit of FC Primal and Witcher mixed in.  I am a fan of that series, recently completing Primal.  So if you like FC, especially Primal, you will most likely like HZD.

The graphics are some of the best I have seen on the PS4, with beautiful scenery, water features that look nearly real, and detailed environments and creatures.  The gameplay feels so smooth and easy to use as compared to my recent experience with DA.  In a lot of respects, the gameplay style is similar to my experience in the FC series, in terms of how you play the game.

The game world is a large open world with a lot of different things to explore and experience.  I was not a bit fan of the method of fast travel that the game has as well as the save point locations, but those complaints are really minor.

Probably my biggest complaint of the game is that the menus feel a bit cluttered and could have been better organized to make it easier to find the things you are looking to do.  The game also doesnt always explain well how to do certain things as well, which was a bit of an annoyance to me at times.

The story is a decent one, although could have been executed a bit better.  I think the game tends to rely on finding information on audio and documents a bit too much and leaves conversations a bit sparse among some of the characters in the game.

As it is with these games, some of the side and collecting quests get old pretty quickly.

Even with some of its shortcomings, the pros far outweigh the cons and I am enjoying this game.

8941,224,1732,"playing this on wiiU again after playing it on ps4  as i can't get enough of this game

best fun i had in the last 2 years its cheerful and funny characters with hilarious dialogs at times

gameplay is smooth with each transformation gives a distinct need to explore more of each level and 100% makes it also extra fun .

omg the music is just super amazing as its super catchy , this also comes with a disk that has some of the games tracks but not all

the extra modes are worth playing too as well as the free BJ mode also keeps you coming for more

honestly this game is a timeless as platformer and well made , any system you play this game it'll be worth it even this Wii U version",1533686400,5
8942,1301,255,Good product,1533686400,5

Love the look as well",1533772800,5
8945,300,948,Great. Get it.,1533772800,5
8946,380,2961,carbon copy it reminds me of RYSE. but still a great game.,1533772800,3
8947,1678,1107,Super flimsy and bad audio qualiy. You'd be better off buying a more expensive headset because this one will not last very long.,1533859200,1
8948,258,714,"It works as intended. If buying for Zelda Breath of the Wild, there are far less expensive alternatives (like the cards with chips in them that will even get you a 20-heart wolf-link without being forced to play Twilight Princess on the Wii-U) that can get you the in-game bonuses without breaking the bank.",1533859200,3
8949,1678,253,Slightly dissapointed by the range but while connected this works well. No lag as long as you don't stray too far from the adapter with the controller.,1533859200,4
8950,183,56,Personally 4 was better.,1533859200,3
8951,1496,2318,"Awesome speed setting for helping out the dos games with low mouse speed multipliers, or slowing it down for getting those fine alignments using CAD or 3D Modeling programs.
Can't live without the speed setting, computing for 25 years now and never knew I'd love a feature so much.

Easier to set color option than the previous same-brand mouse I had, thank-you for listening to your customers.

--Would buy again (and have!).",1533859200,5

8954,436,245,goes great with my collection of amiibo figures.,1533859200,5
8955,1678,1728,"Doesn't really do much. Also, the unit makes a really annoying sound whenever it starts or stops the fan. I had no real change in my heat level when using this. This is really not neccessary.",1533859200,2
8956,1678,3157,Very repetitive and gets boring after a couple of hours. All dialogue between the characters while exploring the open world is the same 3-4 phrases said over and over. Do not reccomend,1533859200,3

I've tried it with a couple of games on steam (Shu and Outlast), as well as Assassins's creed chronicles through uplay and it's worked perfectly with all of them.

8964,1692,3270,Nice! Feels nice in the hands. Has all the features of a PS4/Xbone controller (clickable thumbsticks etc.) Installed GTA V on my Windows 10 laptop. Plugged this in after watching the intro and it was good to go all set up right out the box. A great buy.,1534118400,5

8978,1625,2554,"If you're looking for complete games from yesteryear, then this isn't for you.

Yes, they emulate the games perfectly, but you don't get to play them all the way through.  You're presented with many original NES games to start out with, but they're individual challenges.  You might get a whole stage of a game, but that's it.  And it's not bad, either - each game has a lot of different challenges, like ""pop so many balloons"" or ""jump to the flagpole"" - different tasks in classic NES games, and you get to unlock new games and new challenges.

It's brilliant, really.  When you play these challenges, you unlock various mash-ups with the classics, like playing as Link in Donkey Kong without the ability to jump.  That one kind of perturbed me, but it was still a trip to play, and there are so many others.

If you grew up with a NES, this game is for you.  The day I got it, I found myself noticing the morning sun showing up at my window, I'd been playing it and unlocking new games and challenges all night.",1534204800,5

With my door opened along side my brother opened, AND him being RIGHT next door to me, i didn't even hear him let alone him blasting music. these can get pretty darn loud as well.

If you've been using a PS4 headset and then switch over to these the audio quality is noticeable but for the price they're being sold at its understandable so no complains here. The microphone works great I've only been using this on my computer and have yet to test it on my Xbox One. I don't have to worry about annoying my friends anymore when having the TV across the room from me (volume is kept around 14 or so). So far I've used them 8 hours straight and its surprisingly comfortable since its over the ears it doesn't tire me out. One thing I do wish is that it was a tad bit lighter, but other than that its an amazing headset. I'll be updating as I go along. Hopefully the joints on this will be long lasting which is a problem in most headsets.

Edit : Works great on my Xbox, and honestly its lasting me longer than I thought it would. I'd buy a second headset in the event that it went out in the next year because that's just how amazing the product is at the price its being sold at.",1534291200,5

9023,695,2961,"Well im a huge fan of the GoW series but as usual they had to stray from a winning formula. OK so instead of giving us the action/adventure masterpiece we're used to they had to try and put some role playing and some different combat mechanics in. They try to make the combat feel more like a DS game but the problem is they suck at it. The enemies movements are SO sloppy that it just doesn't work well at all (this is playing the second level from hardest). What really makes you scratch your head is they obviously knew the combat was sloppy, why you ask? Because they had to use visual ques just to make it work at all (yellow or red flahes). Want another example? Later in the game you fight a valkyrie and she has some moves that are instant pain if you miss step, ok cool but the game is so sloppy the the audio ques are useless. When she screams Valhalla Valhalla !!! You know she's about to jump on ya, but sometime she will scream it and do something else or jump on ya and not scream anything, sloppy. When your playing DS you fight the bosses by learning they're moves (because they are precise), when to attack, when to dodge etc,etc. Not the case here, just have to deal with it the best you can. Should have kept Kratos how he was cutting through hordes of enemies because they're not real good at the precision game play. 1 star because I'm a GoW fanboy, 1 star because it is a solid game (haven't seen a bug or had it freeze up yet) and 1 star for the graphics (it looks great).

I needed something that didn't clip to the joystick but rather something that cradled the joystick. Ran across these little babies and thought I'd try them out.
I enjoyed the bright and fun colors. Received them in the mail in two days  and immediately put them on my PS4 controllers. My boyfriend liked them so much he even put them on his Xbox 1 controllers and loves them.
I love the little nubs on the top. I was always tired of my thumbs slipping off my joysticks and having to readjust my thumb all the time. Not with these. Those little bumps keep my thumbs right where I want them. Plus I love the feel of the rubber bumps anyway. I find myself fidgeting with them when my game is in the load screen or in a cut scene.
These little guys make playing my games for hours way more comfortable and enjoyable. So easy to put on and once on they don't move around at all. They are very snug and I love the soft feel the rubber has as well. All in all a wonderful product and would buy again.",1535932800,5

Some reviews state that they spin around and are not as snug as they should be but they are pretty snug on my joysticks. My boyfriend even put a pair on his Xbox 1 controller and has no problems with them spinning around on him. All in all a very cute and convenient product. The rubber is soft and the paw prints lift up just enough to let your thumb have a little bit of a grip.

9040,110,3285,"Best Spider-man game to date in terms of story and gameplay

--Story:
Peter Parker has been Spider-man for 8 years already, so no origin story with the radioactive spider or Uncle Ben's death (although mentioned briefly in the story).

There's a nice mix of a dual lifestyle in this game as the story balance out Peter Parker's personal life with that of Spider-man; making the character you play more relatable and to switch things up so you don't get constant combat making for good pacing.

Plot (minor spoilers, first few hours): Spider-man finally takes down the Kingpin and put him in jail. As a result, a new villain arises in the form of Mister Negative. Mister Negative or Martin Li also runs F.E.A.S.T. shelters across the city, which Peter's Aunt May works for which complicates things.

Aside from the Mister Negative; you face other villains in Spider-man's rogue gallery like Shocker, Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, Dr. Octopus, Vulture, Taskmaster and more. These characters don't play a huge part in the story compared to Mister Negative (and maybe one more villain), but the boss battles they're in are really fun.

Other villains are mentioned (but not able to face against) through phone conversations, collectables, and JJJ podcasts. Guess they want to save it for potential sequel.

There is DLC announced for the Black Cat as of this review with two more to come after.

--Gamplay:

A mix of Spider-man 2 and Batman Arkham games with it's own identity mixed in.

Web-slinging feel very natural once you get the hang of it, and way better than the Spider-man 2 game as you can more manual control. You have to time your button presses to shoot out webs, calculate airtime, forward thrust and momentum. It controls are very seamless once you get used to it.

Combat is very fast paced. Very similar to the Batman Arkham games with it's attack, dodge (when you get spider sense) mechanic, but more room to maneuver around compared to batman due to Spider-man having more agility, speed and ability to web swing.

-Options for combat are:
Melee Attacks

Web based attacks

Dodge

Web Gadgets: use of elemental webbing and/or web bombs/traps. Some of which are super effective against certain enemies

Swing Around- can be used as hit-and-run tactic if you're not high enough level

Grab nearby objects with web and toss at enemies

Activate focus meter/Activate Suit Powers - heal or do finishing move

There's a lot of combinations you can do, especially as you upgrade abilities. Combat is very fast, responsive and will not overwhelm you with options as these abilities will unlock gradually as you progress. It's also not a button masher as some abilities require you to time button presses or hold buttons for few seconds during combos.

-Upgrade System
There are 2 ways to upgrade Spider-man: leveling up and crafting items.

There are 3 upgrade trees you can select from:
Innovator: tactical skills
Defender: Melee combat based
Web-sling: Jump around/dodge better during combat, also can use in overworld/chase sequence mini-games

-Crafting.
You can upgrade your suit and make gadgets by collecting in-game tokens by doing side objectives

-There are 27 suits to collect. To unlock suits to craft, you have to be a certain level (and have materials) or complete certain objectives. If you 100% all side objectives you get this half naked spider-man suit where he's just in his underwear and a Spider-man mask. Last level unlock suit is at level 50.

If you pre-order the game; the Spiderpunk suit, for example is unlocked from the get-go instead of having to wait till you reach level 16.

There are 3 empty spaces for 3 additional suits. I assume it'll be included in the 3 planned story DLC for the game.

-Other Gameplay
To change up the pace a bit; you also play as Mary Jane, where you have to sneak around enemies to escape certain areas.

There's also QTE (quick time events) during cinematic sequences

Taskmaster acts like the Riddler in the Batman Arkham games giving you various side quests around the map before you face him

Game takes around 15-20 hours to complete depending on your skill and how fast you intend to rush through the main story campaign. To collect everything and get platinum trophy it can take upwards to 40 hours.

--Graphics
Game looks very good, especially on the PS4 Pro where Spider-man's suit and puddles stand out more compared to the regular PS4. Whatever format you play it on, the game looks amazing.

Has very good draw distance, and cinematic cutscenes. If you are nitpicky and walk up to individualized objects, the textures may be off a bit. Seeing the fast paced nature of the game, you most likely not have time to look around the over world anyway. Regardless, one of the best looking PS4 games to date

Voice acting is also very good. Like the banter between Peter and Mary Jane. Also get some fun laughs when you use the Quips (tell jokes to enemies) ability for the Comic Spider-man suit.

Overall, had a blast playing this game. If you're a fan of Spider-man or super hero games in general; it's a must buy.",1536278400,5

At first i thought it was the game i was playing but after testing it on others i realized it was the controller itself. Another issue with this controller is that when you rotate the joystick around to move in various directions it will snap to the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions in-game when you rotate the joystick withing a specific degree angle, making it very frustrating in game that require precision movement.

Dont forget the worthless and pointless collectible items you collect all over the map. And then do a main quest every once in awhile. These games identical in every way. Game developers are so lazy, Im sick of the same exact games every time.",1536710400,1

A must play for everyone who owns a PS4 and is looking for a strategy game! yes, it is a little buggy and yes the camera can be a little annoying, but the game play is king here and massively makes up for these points

CONS:
-Load times are huge. At first they aren't so bad but later on we are talking 5 to 10 minutes at the end of a mission.
-ts way too difficult, requiring constant reloads",1536796800,5

9064,319,285,"I have lots of respect for Corsair, despite their keyboards going down hill lately. But their mice are something completely different. I appreciate how Corsair just goes in a completely different direction with their mice shapes, but also continues to deliver great performance and build quality.

The shape is very unique, not many mice use this general shape. Its short, but wide. However, from my experience this can suite all grip styles if your hand is the right size. The shape does take a while to get use to, but once you get use to it I think you would enjoy it.

The buttons are amazing. The left and right click buttons use Omron switches, and they feel great with this shell. Nice and tactile, while being light and quiet. The scroll wheel is one of the best I've used. It has noticeable steps but remains smooth and quiet. Scroll click is a little tight, but that's more than likely due to the high build quality. Left and right click are very tactile but a little mushy at the same time. The sniper button is tactile and tension-ed well, so no accidental hits to that button. Same goes for the DPI buttons.

The sensor is the Pixart PMW3360. I can confirm Corsair implemented this sensor very well, no angle snapping, skipping, jitter or acceleration. No spin outs or anything unusual.",1537056000,5
9065,248,3285,"First and foremost, the taskmaster challenges. They open way too late in the game, and when you can finally access them, they're complete garbage. They're not challenging, or fun, they're just pointlessly frustrating; and a lot of the in-game content is locked behind them. That's my biggest complaint. I would also note that there aren't enough base tokens unless you clear the bases just so, which is also a pointless waste of time and effort, though the challenge tokens become a problem before the base tokens do. It's honestly BS that you can 100%  the game and still not have access to everything, due to contrived and pointless requirements which don't contribute to completion or to gameplay or to the story, and which seem to exist for the sole purpose of constraining the freedom of the player to play the game in the way that they see fit or otherwise enjoy. Which completely sucks.

The second problem is that the stealth, both when playing as Spidey and when playing as MJ or Miles, leaves a lot to be desired. It's impossible to fully stealth bases as Spidey, for instance, since the enemies automatically detect you at wave 2. This isn't game breaking, but is an annoyance for someone who likes to play it slow and smart, and would like the stealth aspects of the game to be more fleshed out.

Missions as MJ or Miles don't offer enough direction, making it too easy to mis-step, unnecessarily forcing the player to start over, and breaking the immersion.

Lastly, there are two bugs: there's a glitch in the animation when beginning a swing from a dive or rapid descent, that's not noticeable at first but gets annoying after you've played for a while (since it both slows you down and looks bad); and occasionally the game crashes when using suit powers.

Complaints aside, the game looks good and feels great, traversal is fun and fast, combat is adequate; Though there need to be more ways way to take down brutes, shield combatants and baton combatants; the dodge button often doesn't work; and there's occasionally no way to break out after getting boxed in, leading to an unnecessary death. I would also note that finishers are basically useless, since health depletes so quickly, and since the focus bar barely heals you at all, fills very slowly, and only holds 3 charges. Your only real option if you get depleted and are low on health (which can happen frequently since the dodge button doesn't work at least 35% of the time, and due to the health, healing and focus related issues I've already pointed out), is to swing around to build up focus (which build faster from swinging than from combat, for whatever reason), spamming the heal button while dodging bullets and rpgs and sometimes boss attacks until you're well enough to fight again; which, while not the worst thing in the world, doesn't really inspire much confidence in Spider-Man's competence in combat (or at the very least, in first aid), and makes finishers a risky luxury rather than a useful tool.

Flaws aside, I enjoyed the game, and am waiting, albeit impatiently, for NG+ mode and the upcoming DLC. Maybe then I can unlock all the suits...",1537142400,3
9066,60,1011,"On my desk, I have way too many input devices. To save space, this 84 key mechanical keyboard does the job.
Losing the space the numeric keypad takes up allows me to use other input devices on my desk without having to move them to different spots.

With Cherry MX keys, this is a solid keyboard. Although with mech you get more clickity clack, the feedback is excellent and I enjoy typing on this keyboard. But the noise.... is less than desired especially if you stream and have to do work arounds on the open mic.

Here are some things that I wish they would improve and why I gave it 3 stars. I am being very critical here because this is not a cheap keyboard.

- This should be wireless.
- Needs to be quieter. For people who stream and game near an open mic, this can be improved on the hardware end.
- Price is too high. This is no more than a $80 keyboard. With less keys and plastic material being used it should cost less.
- Have more ergonomic tilt angles to work with. All keyboard manufacturers screw up on this part by not allowing different angle positions on the footer stops. There should be at least 4 heights with 2 degrees of variations.
- Cable takes up two USB ports. Its really a waste if one is not using the backside USB port for anything. Having a mouse connected to the back of the keyboard doesn't save anything. Its still wired and just adds more clutter with more of the mouse cable on the desk. More so, I imagine an USB input controller sitting inside the keyboard that queues up both keyboard and mouse input. Let the operating system decide who gets priority.
- iCue only allows up to 5 levels of lighting effects. This is really a problem for those who use applications (like games) that need to categorize lighting according to different game input categories. There is little point in owning a RGB keyboard if this is limited. If Corsair can do all sorts of library effeccts on 16 million RGB colors, whats the problem with having more than 5 static color overlays? Its static. If the problem is you can 't refresh fast enough then you got a design problem you need to address to fix your keyboard. So fix it!",1537401600,3

9069,90,2626,"I have no complaints about the keyboard itself. I love how it types, and the keys are easy to press and sensitive. Solid for typing. I don't use it for much gaming, as I usually use a controller.

My issue is with the software that Corsair is supplying for the lighting. I also own the M65 PRO RGB Mouse and MM800 RGB Polaris mouse pad. All of these run under the Corsair software called iCue.

When I first got my keyboard/mouse/pad I was running an older version of this software when it was just called 'Cue'. The software would mess with my USB ports bad. It would lock up other USB devices (like my game controllers) and it would cause Steam to freeze/lock up. I stumbled on a Steam forum topic where others had the same issue, and it just so happened the Cue software was the issue. The fix was to either flip the firmware switch on the back of the keyboard all the way to the last spot, then back to the first spot, or unplug all the Corsair devices and plug them back in. Sometimes this wouldn't work, and a full system restart was the only thing that would fix it. It was an annoyance for sure.

Now, Corsair has rolled out the iCue version of the software. At first, it was a great upgrade and cut out the issue I had with it locking up USB ports. But now, it's randomly causing my entire system to do a hard freeze. At first I thought I was having RAM or Graphics card issues, but I know now that is not the case. Every time my system freezes (ctrl+alt+delete doesn't even work), I have to unplug all 3 of the Corsair products I have from thier USB slots. It takes a few seconds, but eventually my system then becomes fully responsive and I can then plug back in the USB ports and everything is fine. Until the next random freeze happens.

I love the keyboard, the mouse is awesome, and the mouse pad looks sharp. But I am still ping ponging ticket updates with Corsair to try and find out what is causing this issue, but it is for sure in the iCue software. If I don't run the software, I never get a freeze.",1537833600,3
9070,110,3287,"A choose your own adventure like other Quantic Dreams* games, Telltale games, or Life is Strange series; where you make moral decisions for your characters, do QTE (quick timed events), collectable items to acquire, and explore area for clues to make your own personalized adventure.

Unlike other Quantic Dream games there are a lot of improvements, most of which are great quality of life changes:

1. Graphics. Greatly improved since Heavy Rain. If you watch the Kara tech demo; the finished product is surprisingly better than that. Character facial expressions are really good in this game, and doesn't look artificial like something you see in LA Niore (game)

2. Flow Chart. In the menu screen/after you finish a chapter; the game actually gives you all possible branching paths in a chapter, so you can replay and see all scenarios (if you want). They give you branching paths for each chapter, but some chapters are not unlocked until some requirements/actions are made from previous chapters

3.  Characters are more free flowing during exploratory segments. They are still stiff and camera angles still get in the way at times; but less finicky than past titles and other games in the genre. In second play through everything is more smoother, not sure if I got used to the game scene or was too focused on it in my first play through.

4. Highlighted objects. Seeing you play androids, you can scan area for all possible object/character interactions. No need to constantly press a button and wonder around to see what you can interact with

5. Voice acting greatly improved, especially for voice acting of children in the story. All performances feel believable and none (except for purposeful mono-tone androids) don't feel dialed in. Soundtrack for the game is also very good

Story:

Starts off as a Blade Runner-esk story where Androids question their free will. The story doesn't really go in-depth into this, and more of a racial liberation story for Androids in human society. May start off a bit philosophical, but becomes more simplified as the story goes on and more of the mystery in unraveled

You follow 3 main leads:

Kara: A housemaid Android who helps a little girl escape from her abused father.

Conner: An Android police detective, who solves mysteries of why Android are becoming deviant and murdering their human masters

Markus: A care-taker android for a senior citizen who provides a lot of potential to learn and grow with a liberal viewpoint on androids

All 3 story lines intersect at one point (if no one dies before they meet up).

Gameplay times may vary depending on your choices; especially if one or two of the leads die off early on; cutting off maybe 1/3 of the game. My first playthrough took me 12-15 hours to complete.

I personally stick to my choices as some actions that look like mistakes initially may have better consequnces in the future

Like previous Quantic Dreams games; you still do remedial tasks. Some have no impact on the story, but get you more engaged into the characters through emotional resonance and help better understand gameplay/QTE movements during high action scenes.

PSN trophies. Easy platinum. You don't need to complete all possible routes. May take you 40+ hours to get all trophies depending how you go about it. Best to play the game first without a guide or game plan for a fun immersive experience

Overall, story is very fun and a major draw to this game with high production value. If you like this genre of games it's highly recommended.",1537920000,4
